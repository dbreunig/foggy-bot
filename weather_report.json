    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a moist blanket of clouds drapes the city, promising a cool, somewhat brisk evening. The air feels alive, as a west-southwest wind rustles through, creating whispers among the trees and a gentle sway in the urban landscape. With temperatures hovering near the low fifties, the need for a light jacket becomes apparent, especially in the shadows where the wind dances a little more freely.\n\nTomorrow invites the sun to grace the horizon, casting its warm embrace over the chilly remnants of night. Although the morning carries with it the memory of the cloud cover, midday will unveil a brighter, sunnier atmosphere, with temperatures nudging up to around sixty-five degrees by afternoon. This transitioning day hints at the delicate balance of fog and sun, indicating an early marine layer that might linger but will fade as the warmth fights its way through. As you consider your activities, perhaps a casual stroll through the quieter streets or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to savor the serenity of the morning would be most rewarding, as the city awakens to sunshine and the promise of a beautiful day.",
