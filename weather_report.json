    "weather_report": "This evening, Downtown San Francisco embraces a modest clarity amidst soft, shifting clouds. The sun may have retreated, yet an effulgent warmth lingers, accompanied by gentle breezes from the southwest. As the twilight envelops the city, a hint of rain finds its way into the forecast, whispering promises of hydration after dawn. The cooling air, currently approaching a mild 49 degrees, suggests that a light jacket would be wise for an outing. \n\nTucked within the embrace of the hills, fog meanders quietly, though particularly to the north, casting an otherworldly veil across the Golden Gate. For those venturing out, the muted ambiance invites introspection. Whether you choose an evening walk along the Embarcadero or a stroll through the vibrant Mission, there\u2019s a stillness to savor, bolstered by the distant hum of city life and the occasional rustle of the wind. Allow yourself to linger in the soft light, a perfect backdrop for contemplative moments.",
