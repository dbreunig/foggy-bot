    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a stillness fills the air, typical of early mornings in May. The city, quiet and serene, lies beneath a mostly clear sky, with only the faintest hints of lingering fog brushing against the coastal hills. The temperature, cool yet refreshing, hovers around 51 degrees, inviting a light jacket or a cozy sweater for those venturing out. The gentle west-southwest wind whispers through the streets at 8 mph, occasionally picking up to dance at 18 mph, a reminder of the city\u2019s capricious nature.\n\nAs the day unfolds, bright sunlight will wash over the landscape, promising a high of 66 degrees that begins to invite the warmth of late spring. Though temperatures may dip slightly in the afternoon, the overall clarity of the day suggests a backdrop perfect for leisurely activities. A stroll through one of the city's vibrant parks offers a chance to soak up the sun, or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 is in order, where one can relish a warm cup while enjoying the emerging energy of the city. Dressing in layers will ensure both comfort and readiness for the playful winds that characterize the Bay Area, offering a reassuring balance between coolness and warmth. Breathe deeply, enjoy the gentle glow of the day, and let the calmness of San Francisco inspire simple pleasures.",
