    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds drifts in, punctuated by the soft glow of city lights below. There is a palpable anticipation in the air; a chance of rain whispers through the evening hours with a 50% likelihood of light precipitation likely before the clock strikes eleven. The tranquility is punctuated only by a light west wind, hinting at the crispness of the air, which is expected to dip to around 46 degrees, urging the wise to reach for a cozy jacket or hoodie before venturing out. \n\nTomorrow, the San Francisco sun promises a refreshing return, revealing a mostly sunny canvas with a high whispering near 59 degrees. As the marine layer reluctantly retreats, one may find the day ideal for leisurely strolls through the city's storied streets or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, savoring the aromas of roasted coffee and fresh pastries while the world outside unfolds in a vivid palette of blue. With a light north northwest breeze gently brushing the skin, there\u2019s a pleasant invitation to explore the outdoors, though a layer might still be wise for those prone to chilly sea breezes. With clarity gradually returning and opportunities for warmth beckoning, it\u2019s a day to embrace the subtle beauty and unique charm that San Francisco generously offers.",
