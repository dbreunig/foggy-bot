    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city stirs beneath a shroud of clouds, the atmosphere punctuated by a hint of rain. With the mercury dipping to a nippy 54 degrees, the air carries the crest of moisture, each drop promising to kiss the ground as the day unfolds. Winds shift from the south southwest, making a gentle entrance at 7 to 10 mph, inviting whispers of warmth even amidst the coolness. Today, expect the sun to play coy, peeking through the layers of gray skies with a high hovering around 61, before yielding to a gradual descent into the blue hues of afternoon.\n\nThis morning's light, wrapped in moisture-laden layers, casts a tranquil glow over the bay, with a pervasive marine layer signaling its steadfast presence. While the chance of precipitation flirts at 50%, one might find solace in raindrops drumming softly against the rooftops rather than a deluge sweeping through. For today's attire, a light jacket would serve one well\u2014enough to ward off the chill yet breathable for the subtler warmth promised by the afternoon sun. As you wander the avenues, consider ambling through the heart of the city, where the wet pavement glistens invitingly, or perchance retire to a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring warm brews whilst you watch the world move in its delightful chaos.",
