    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the sky wears a painted blush reminiscent of the softest caress of morning light. With mostly sunny skies ushering in a high that flirts near 70 degrees, the city is poised for a pleasant day ahead. Yet, as whispers of the west-southwest winds tug gently at your skin, blowing between 13 to 24 mph, they remind you that the chill of the ocean is never too far away. Gazing towards the Golden Gate Bridge, one might glimpse patches of fog lingering at the water\u2019s edge, hinting at the marine layer's embrace. This fog will tease the clearer afternoon, rising and fading as the sun claims dominion. \n\nAs the sun takes its place, slipping into mid-afternoon, temperatures will gracefully lower to a cozy 68. Dressed in layers\u2014perhaps a light shirt topped with a breezy sweater\u2014you can traverse the city with ease. Today invites exploration at a leisurely pace; perhaps indulge in a morning coffee at a quiet caf\u00e9, or wander through the artistic labyrinth of the Mission District, mingling with the vibrant local colors. As twilight approaches, settling in with a book at outdoor seating can be a splendid way to savor the cooling hours, just as evening offers a coming together of clouds above, darkening towards nighttime but still holding the day\u2019s warmth. The comfort of the evening low around 58 degrees beckons, wrapping you in a gentle embrace as you step out to enjoy the mellowness of the San Francisco night.",
