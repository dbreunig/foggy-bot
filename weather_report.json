    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco will settle into a peaceful calm, with mostly clear skies inviting the gentle swirls of a light southwest breeze. The temperature is poised to dip to a comfortable low, creating the perfect setting for an evening stroll along the waterfront, where the city's lights begin to twinkle like stars against the vast Bay. If you venture out, a light jacket will offer just enough warmth for comfort, and the quiet of the night serves as an invitation to reflect, or perhaps pause for a moment to enjoy the serene beauty of the surroundings.\n\nAs we head into Thursday, expect the sun to rise high and bright, casting golden rays over the city, with temperatures reaching a delightful warmth in the early afternoon. The day promises a canvas of mostly sunny skies, perfect for leisurely outdoor activities. A casual day awaits, perhaps spent on a walk through Golden Gate Park, where you can immerse yourself amidst the lush greenery, or discovering the local caf\u00e9s that pepper the streets\u2014all while taking in the invigorating air that carries hints of salt from the Bay. Given the light winds, dress in layers; a simple t-shirt paired with a light sweater is ideal, allowing you to adapt to the shifting warmth of the day's embrace.",
