    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a light shroud of clouds drapes the city, flickering with the faint echoes of city lights. The temperatures dip gently, inviting residents to wrap themselves in a soft layer against the mild chill, with the air carrying the crisp scent of the ocean. The breeze, a gentle whisper from the southwest, dances around you, coaxing a sense of serenity amidst the urban bustle.\n\nTomorrow promises a transition as the sun peeks through, teasing the horizon with the anticipation of a bright day. Though the afternoon may usher in a slight coolness, the overall feel will be pleasant, encouraging leisurely strolls or perhaps a quiet moment at a favorite caf\u00e9, sipping something warm. As the marine layer ebbs away, the fog may linger in pockets, creating a dynamic interplay between soft light and shadow, a beautiful backdrop for those seeking inspiration in the everyday. With such conditions, a light jacket paired with comfortable layers will be ideal; versatile enough for the morning's cool embrace and the day's gradual warmth. Whether meandering through the streets or simply enjoying the view from a window, there's tranquility to be found in this lovely San Francisco atmosphere.",
