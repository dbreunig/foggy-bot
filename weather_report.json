    "weather_report": "As we settle into the afternoon, Downtown San Francisco is graced with mostly sunny skies, a refreshing contrast to the draperies of fog that often envelop the region. The temperature hovers near sixty-two degrees, with a gentle west northwest breeze offering a tender caress against the skin. The sun, casting its warm glow, teases the lingering chill of the morning, inviting residents to step outside with a light jacket or sweater, the ideal armor against the coolness that may greet them later in the day.\n\nAs evening approaches, a blanket of partly cloudy skies will descend, wrapping the city in a gentle embrace as temperatures drop to a cozy forty-eight. Those with evening plans may find the scenery pleasant yet crisp, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet visit to one of the many local caf\u00e9s, where the rich aroma of coffee fills the air and the warmth of conversation kindles a sense of community. The absence of fog today allows glimpses of the iconic structures, seamlessly blending urban life with the natural splendor that surrounds it, making it an opportune moment to indulge in the vibrant street life or simply take a moment of reflection as the sun dips below the horizon.",
