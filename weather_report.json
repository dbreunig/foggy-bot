    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a gentle embrace of partly sunny skies, the light dancing through a veil of clouds that hangs delicately overhead. As the day progresses, the inclination is for temperatures to ebb slightly, hinting at an afternoon coolness that befits the city's character. A wind from the west-southwest whispers at a brisk pace, rustling the trees and bringing a lively energy to the streets.\n\nAs the sun hovers above the horizon, the clarity of the day is not lost amid the gentle sighs of a possible marine layer lurking nearby, though it appears benign for now. While the fog may yet roll in, especially as evening descends, a light jacket might be advisable to ward off the chill that often follows the sun's retreat. The atmosphere is inviting, ideal for casual wanderings along the waterfront or a quiet retreat to a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm beverage while watching the world go by. Whatever the choice, the day offers a blend of comfort and coolness, urging you to dive into the rhythm of city life without a care.",
