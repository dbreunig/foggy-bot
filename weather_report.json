With soft winds whispering from the west, this is a morning that feels refreshingly brisk, yet unburdened by fog, which often grips this city in its clammy embrace. A few patches of marine layer linger just offshore, retreating, as if to allow the sunlight to indulge the inhabitants below.\n\nAs one steps outside, the lightness of spring hangs in the air, suggesting a layered approach to attire\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a t-shirt, complemented by comfortable shoes for wandering through the streets and parks. The absence of fog ushers in the perfect atmosphere for a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the ripple of the bay glimmers under the sun\u2019s advance. Sipping coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or visiting the Ferry Building Market might lend its own charm, permitting onlookers a moment to appreciate the scenery, as sailboats dot the horizon.
