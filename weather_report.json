The gentle whisper of the west-southwest breeze brushes against skin, a reminder of the coolness that accompanies the morning's moist breath. As the city stirs, the forecast hints at a modest yet promising shift, with ochres and blues suggesting a partly sunny day ahead, where warmth will attempt to break through the veil, reaching a comfortable 64 degrees before nudging back down to a cooler embrace by afternoon.\n\nThe presence of fog, typical of this coastal haven, hovers near the water's edge, hinting at a marine layer that still holds its ground, but as time passes, it will yield to patches of sunshine. Keeping things pleasant yet still a touch brisk, dressing in layers will serve well\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a shirt, paired with comfortable pants for an afternoon stroll. Already, light has begun to play upon the cityscape, a magic that could carry one to the blooming parks or to the little caf\u00e9 around the corner, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee invites one to pause, breathe, and observe the kind of urban charm that flows through these streets\u2014a day like many others, yet unique in its own unfolding.",
