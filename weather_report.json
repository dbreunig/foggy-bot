    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco awakens this morning cloaked in the soft embrace of rain, a steady companion through the night heralded by gusty winds that ripple through the streets. The air is filled with a whisper of chill, setting the mood for a day that promises damp, gray skies but also a certain introspective beauty. As clouds drape over the city, the visibility is muted, with only fragments of color seeping through\u2014the optimistic hues of rooftops and the occasional shimmer from the Bay. The rain is persistent but gentle, bringing with it the soothing sound of pattering droplets that blend seamlessly with the city\u2019s rhythmic heartbeat.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the rain to linger, especially during the morning hours, tapering somewhat as the daylight progresses. The forecast glimmers with hope for a brief intermission, but one should remain prepared for the possibility of more moisture in the air. Dressing in layers will be wise\u2014think a light waterproof jacket over a warm sweater, complemented by comfortable shoes for any necessary excursions. It\u2019s a perfect day for indulging in the cozy warmth of a local coffee shop, where the world outside is softened by rain-dusted windows. Perhaps find solace in a good book or engage in quiet conversation with friends as the city embraces a slow, contemplative Sunday, inviting all to pause and reflect amid the clouds.",
