The city awakens to a cool breath of air, whispering through the streets, inviting early risers to step outside and savor the quiet moments before the bustle begins. With temperatures lingering in the low fifties, this day holds the promise of warmth as the sun prepares to cast its golden rays, transitioning to a high near sixty-four by afternoon. While fog remains at bay for now, hints of a marine layer linger on the horizon, suggesting that by afternoon, it may flirt with the edges of the bay, softening the city\u2019s sharp outlines.\n\nDressing in layers is wise; a light jacket or sweater will provide comfort during those initial tender hours before the sun fully claims the sky. As the day unfolds, the weather invites leisurely pursuits\u2014perhaps a stroll along the waterfront, where one can feel the gentle energy of the waves against the shore, or a visit to a favorite caf\u00e9, warming hands around a cup of coffee while the world outside comes alive with vibrant hues and sounds. This day in San Francisco beckons you to enjoy the serene beauty it has to offer, with just a touch of nostalgia in the cool air.",
