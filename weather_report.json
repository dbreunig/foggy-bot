    "weather_report": "As the early afternoon sun casts its gentle warmth across Downtown San Francisco, the air feels pleasantly crisp, with a mild breeze nudging about ten miles per hour. The sky, primarily a bright blue, offers only soft clouds drifting in from the west, serving as a reminder of the marine layer that still lingers near the coast. The Golden Gate Bridge remains visible, albeit in a slightly hazy embrace, suggesting the presence of light fog across the bay but nothing that would impede your plans. \n\nProgressing into the evening, expect the clouds to gather a bit more, bringing with them a coolness as temperatures drop to the upper 50s. With the winds calming, a light jacket or sweater would be wise as the sun sets and shadows deepen across the city streets. This evening calls for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the play of lingering light against the water offers a tranquil retreat. Perhaps a small caf\u00e9 beckons with the aroma of fresh coffee or pastries, inviting you to pause and soak in the ambiance of a city that never quite sleeps.",
