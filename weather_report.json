    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night unfolds under a canopy of stars, the air crisp and cool as the city breathes with a gentle sigh of the Pacific\u2019s embrace. After a sunny Independence Day, when warmth met the laughter of locals, the temperature settles predictably into the low fifties, with a steady west wind whispering through the streets, softening any residual heat from the day\u2019s festivities. What appears as a clear night is punctuated by the remnants of the sea's low-lying fog, teasingly lingering along the edges of the horizon\u2014a ballet between clarity and mystery, perfect for a reflective evening stroll.\n\nAs dawn breaks on this delightful summer day, expect a return to the sun\u2019s radiant glow, illuminating the city with soft light. Though daytime temperatures promise to hover around the comfortable low sixties, the brisk winds may remind you that San Francisco never relinquishes its coastal signature entirely. For those venturing out, layering will be essential: a light sweater or jacket will serve as a companion against the refreshing gusts while allowing you to indulge in the day\u2019s warmth as it unfolds. This weather invites moments of tranquility, perhaps at a caf\u00e9 where you can sip a warm drink and watch the world go by, or a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering bay meets the bustling city\u2014a perfect blend of serenity and life on this beautiful July day.",
