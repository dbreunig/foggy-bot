    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun casts a gentle embrace over Downtown San Francisco, lending the city a sense of warmth as the high reaches a comfortable 66 degrees. However, by now, a familiar coolness is settling in, as temperatures drift toward the mid-60s. The west-southwest winds breathe life into the air, rustling the leaves with a refreshing cadence, though the gusts may surprise with a quickened intensity. All around, the day unfolds in a decidedly clear fashion, a far cry from the fog that often shrouds this vibrant city.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect a soft transition into a partly cloudy night, where temperatures will dip to around 54. The lingering breeze will continue, smoothing the edges of the evening. As for attire, light layers would serve one well\u2014a sweater or light jacket to counteract the cooler evening air. With the backdrop of a serene sky and a hint of cloudiness, it\u2019s an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a cozy visit to a nearby caf\u00e9 for a quiet moment with a book, allowing the gentle sounds of the city to weave into the evening.",
