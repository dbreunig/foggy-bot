    "weather_report": "A delicate mist cloaks Downtown San Francisco this morning, creating a muted ambiance that invites quiet reflection. As you look out towards the Golden Gate, the iconic structure appears partly veiled, while low, brooding clouds hang close to the horizon. This gray palette speaks of a day where sunshine may struggle to break free, but the city is imbued with a cool calmness, underscored by soft winds whispering through the streets.\n\nAs the afternoon unfolds, expect temperatures to hover gently around 55 degrees, carrying the weight of the impending rain, which could arrive after sundown. With a chance of showers lingering in the air, it would be wise to carry an umbrella when venturing out, while dressing in layers will allow you to navigate the variable conditions with ease. The marine layer may kiss the hills, lending a mystical quality to your stroll along the waterfront, where the fresh scent of the bay adds a spark of life to the day. Consider visiting a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink, or perhaps take a leisurely walk through one of the city\u2019s beautiful parks, letting the charm of an overcast day envelop you completely.",
