    "weather_report": "As the night unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a soft curtain of clouds occasionally obscures the sky, woven with the brisk hint of the west-southwest wind. The temperature settles gently around 51 degrees, creating a cool, refreshing atmosphere that invites a light jacket or a cozy sweater. Starlight flickers above, mingling with the city\u2019s glow, while the occasional gust brings whispers of the Pacific, stirring the imagination towards tomorrow's promise.\n\nThe approaching day hints at a pleasant awakening with mostly sunny skies, temperatures nudging near 65 but receding to the comfortable embrace of 63 by afternoon. While the morning may present the lingering whispers of fog as it retreats back towards the ocean, by midday, the sun should prevail, casting a gentle warmth upon the bustling streets. For those wandering through the city, a light layer will suffice, ideal for an inspiring lunch at an outdoor caf\u00e9 or a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, as the clear air dances with promises of spring.",
