The air carries the scent of a fresh morning, damp but refreshing, as temperatures hover around a comfortable 56 degrees. While the low clouds offer a more muted skyline, the hints of what lies beneath\u2014iconic structures barely outlined against the backdrop\u2014suggest a fleeting strength that the day may unveil. As the hours progress, the moisture is expected to dissipate, permitting the sun to peer through the clouds, promising a partly sunny afternoon with temperatures nudging toward a pleasant 62.\n\nAs the city awakens, the gentle west-southwest winds dance at a playful pace of seven to fourteen miles per hour, mingling with the lingering marine layer that softens the horizon. For those venturing out, a light jacket or a cardigan would suit the day's flow, offering just enough comfort against the morning chill. Consider strolling through one of the tranquil parks, perhaps sipping a warm beverage as the sun begins its arc, illuminating the city\u2019s spirit anew. With the forecast hinting at clearer skies, it may also be an opportunity to visit a cozy caf\u00e9 or explore the artistic soul of the neighborhood\u2014perfect for discovering hidden gems among the muted radiance of a transforming day.",
