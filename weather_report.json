    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp and clear, holding a gentle embrace around 54 degrees. A light southwest breeze stirs softly, almost whispering secrets of the ocean tide. The reflections from the city's lights dance across the horizon, hinting at the tranquil charm of the evening. Although the sky remains mostly clear, the faint suggestion of fog lingers nearby, as if nature is teasing a return of the familiar marine layer that often hugs the coast.\n\nAs dawn approaches, Thursday promises to unveil a bright and sunny day, inviting you to step outside and indulge in the warmth of the afternoon sun, peeking just above 69 degrees before softly tapering to 67 as the day progresses. It would be wise to dress in layers; a light sweater or jacket may be prudent for the morning, especially before the sun's rays fully dissolve the cool undertow. Consider enjoying a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the gentle caress of the wind will serve as the perfect backdrop for a peaceful morning coffee, or perhaps visit a local bookstore to lose yourself in the world of literature, allowing the tranquil atmosphere to guide your thoughts. Whether a day of exploration or a quiet refuge indoors, San Francisco offers an inviting blend of life and serenity.",
