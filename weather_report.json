    "weather_report": "Evening has quietly settled over Downtown San Francisco, casting a soft, muted palette upon the city\u2019s iconic skyline. The air holds a whisper of moisture, hinting at the delicate dance of drizzle expected after 11 PM. As the night envelops the streets below, the gentle west-southwest winds gust with a playful chill, rustling tree leaves and brushing against the skin. Temperatures hover around 59 degrees, encouraging layers that provide warmth while allowing breathability for the evening's mild air.\n\nAs dawn arrives on Friday, the clouds will recede, unveiling a canvas of mostly sunny skies. A slight chance of early morning drizzle may still linger before 11 AM, leaving just enough moisture in the air to refresh the senses, while the day's high nudges close to 67, slightly retreating to 65 as afternoon approaches. With another breezy day ahead, dappled sunlight will dance across the streets, highlighting the vibrancy of city life. A light jacket or a comfortable sweater will suit this transitional weather, making a stroll through local parks an inviting prospect. Alternatively, enjoy the quiet of an early caf\u00e9, savoring a warm beverage while watching the city awaken from its foggier moments.\n\nIn the coming hours, the atmosphere suggests an ease about the day, perfect for low-key explorations or simply taking in the work of artsy boutiques that dot the streets. Whether it's a leisurely moment at a park bench or a quiet read at a favorite spot, the day's potential lies in its simplicity, cradled by the gentle embrace of the San Francisco breeze.",
