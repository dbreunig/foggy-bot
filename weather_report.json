    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a canopy of uncertainty, with hints of fog lazily clinging to the hills and a soft sprinkle of rain lingering in the air. The forecast calls for a day that may hold a touch of drama, with clouds occasionally parting to reveal the sun\u2019s shy countenance around midday. Anticipate the day to warm slightly, reaching a high that flirts with the cool end of comfortable; the gentle southwest breeze whispers stories from the bay at a brisk five to twelve miles per hour. \n\nAs the morning unfolds, the patchy fog will likely retreat, though it may leave behind a fleeting coolness best known to San Franciscans. It's advisable to layer up\u2014think a light sweater beneath a classic windbreaker, perfect for the dance of sunshine and shadow. With a mild evening waiting to wrap itself around the city, it could be an opportune time for a stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the quaint caf\u00e9s that dot the landscape. Whether savoring a warm drink while watching the gentle movements of the bay or simply breathing in the crisp air, it\u2019s a day meant for embracing the unique character that defines this city.",
