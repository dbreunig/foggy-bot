    "weather_report": "As the city of San Francisco gently huddles beneath a quilt of clouds tonight, the atmosphere is thick with the promise of rain and the distant rumble of thunder. The low temperature settles in around 45 degrees, inching upward to a slightly warmer 47 as the hours drift by. The gusty west-southwest winds weave through the streets, carrying crisp droplets and whispers of stormy intrigue. Visibility may wane as the evening unfolds, with a 90% chance of precipitation transforming the urban skyline. \n\nThursday dawns with lingering showers, giving way to patches of sunlight fighting their way through a stubborn cover. The high struggles to reach 53, and the wind persists, brisk and invigorating, a reminder of nature's playful touch. The air feels fresh, if just a tad cool, urging you to wrap a light jacket around your shoulders, perhaps layered over a cozy sweater. For those considering outdoor pursuits, a leisurely stroll through the rain-kissed streets or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 might serve as perfect remedies to the somber yet poetic embrace of the weather. Embrace the day's invitation to savor the moment, perhaps with a good book or the quiet enjoyment of a warm drink, all while the elements play out their dance overhead.",
