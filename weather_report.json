    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the stillness of night hangs between the buildings, with temperatures cooling to a comfortable 54 degrees, inviting a cozy layer against the gentle whisper of a west-southwest breeze. The clouds, blanket-like and elusive, hold onto the promise of a new day. As dawn breaks, the forecast anticipates a retreat of gloom, giving way to the gentle caress of the sun. The day ahead hints at occasional drizzles after the sun's peak, painting a scene promising warmth that will hover around the mid-60s, yet cool into the glimmering shadows of the afternoon.\n\nLooking out, one might find the marine layer curling softly around the city's famous landmarks, a delicate mist that dances along the Golden Gate. Such a sight suggests a day whose charm lies in the unexpected embrace of fog mingling with light, evoking a sense of serenity amidst the urban pulse. For those venturing out, a light layer is advisable, perhaps a cardigan or a light jacket, ideal for both the early coolness and the mild afternoon warmth. As the day unfolds, consider wandering through the local art galleries, or perhaps settling into one of the quaint cafes that dot the streets, inviting all to savor a leisurely moment with a warm beverage in hand, allowing the day to drift gently into evening with the soft clang of nearby streetcars marking the passage of hours.",
