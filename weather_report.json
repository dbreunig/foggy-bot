    "weather_report": "As the night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a gentle cloak of cloudiness lingers in the air, wrapping the streets with a comforting embrace. The forecast hints at a low of around 54, perfectly suitable for a stroll under the subtle glow of street lamps, where the anticipation of tomorrow\u2019s early morning fog fades in an instant. A breeze drifts softly from the west-southwest, whispering tales of the bay's secrets as it carries the coolness through the alleys.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, daylight promises a reprieve, with partly sunny skies inviting you to shed the nocturnal musings of the city. As the sun ascends, the temperature will rise to a high near 64 before gracefully curving downward in the afternoon. It's an ideal day to explore local caf\u00e9s or meander through the vibrant waterfront, allowing the refreshing wind to invigorate your senses. While the marine layer may shyly linger in the distance, offering occasional glimpses of gray, its presence adds a touch of mystique rather than gloom. Dressing in layers is wisest, as the day's warmth dances between fleeting sunny patches and the cool embrace of the lingering marine air. Perhaps enjoy a leisurely breakfast outdoors or take a casual walk through your favorite neighborhood, allowing the day to unfold at its own leisurely pace.",
