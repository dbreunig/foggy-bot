    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity envelops the city, illuminated by the glow of streetlights and the fading warmth of day. The unencumbered sky invites a soft breeze, carrying hints of the Pacific, while the nighttime temperatures gracefully settle to about 46 degrees. It\u2019s a serene time to step outside, perhaps wrapped in a light jacket or a cozy sweater, as the mild wind brushes against your skin, whispering of the calm night ahead.\n\nLooking to tomorrow, the promise of sun will cast its lively glow across the city. Sunday beckons with temperatures hovering near 60, gently dropping as the afternoon unfolds. The spirit of this day suggests a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet afternoon spent in one of those charming caf\u00e9s clustered in the heart of the city. Unfurl your senses, and prepare for a day with no fog to obscure the view; the marine layer remains at bay, allowing the picturesque outline of the Golden Gate Bridge to stand proud against the horizon. With such conditions, one might find joy in a midday outing, leisurely exploring the hidden gems of downtown or simply savoring a moment amidst the vibrant pulse of the city.",
