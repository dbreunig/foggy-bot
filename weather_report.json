    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a promise of warmth beneath a gently receding sun. The skies are mostly sunny, inviting the world to bask in a brief interlude before the deepening clouds of evening embrace the city. As the afternoon drifts toward twilight, temperatures will ease into a comfortable 62 degrees, while a refreshing west-southwest breeze rustles through the streets, punctuated by brisk gusts that serve as a reminder of the city's coastal origins. \n\nTonight, the atmosphere will shift to a more subdued palette as clouds weave their way across the skyline, bringing a low of about 57. The pleasant wind continues, whispering through the streets, heralding the softening of the day. Fog, typical of the coastal chill, hovers languidly just beyond the bridges, hinting at the marine layer's gentle encroachment. With these conditions, light layers will serve you well\u2014think a cozy sweater or a light jacket to keep the cool at bay. Such a day invites simple pleasures; perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a small caf\u00e9 visit to sip on something warm while watching the city\u2019s vibrant evening unfold.",
