Today\u2019s forecast predicts a mostly sunny disposition, with a high lingering near a cool 59 degrees, inviting a sense of calm as the west wind sways lightly, whispering along the streets. As the hours drift past, temperatures will ease back to a comfortable 57, perfect for those who favor a brisk stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment in one of the parks that fringe this urban landscape.\n\nThis moment calls for layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater to ward off the morning chill, followed by a breezy jacket for the afternoon when the sun fully breaks through. The likelihood of fog is minimal, with only a remnant marine layer hinting at the coastline\u2019s ever-present influence, lingering like an afterthought. It\u2019s an ideal day to sip coffee at a local caf\u00e9 while watching the city pulse to life or to visit one of the lesser-known galleries tucked away in an alley, their artworks echoing the city\u2019s vibrant soul. As night falls, a clear expanse awaits, where the stars might shyly twinkle against the backdrop of the cool air settling in at around 47 degrees.",
