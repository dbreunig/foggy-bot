    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a mostly sunny tableau, as the sun embraces the city with a gentle warmth that hints at a high near 67 degrees. The lively west-southwest winds, brisk at 14 to 21 mph, bring a refreshing touch, occasionally gusting up to 30 mph, stirring leaves and encouraging the scent of the bay to wander through the streets. As the afternoon progresses, the clarity of the day sharpens, revealing a vibrant skyline that dances with the play of light, while the ever-present fog remains at bay, retreating to the embrace of the ocean for now.\n\nAs evening draws near, the atmosphere transitions into a serene, partly cloudy sky that promises a low around 57 degrees. A light jacket or sweater would be wise, keeping you cozy as the winds persist; their playful nature gently nudges the cool air around, a reminder of the marine influence that forever lingers in this coastal cityscape. With this pleasant weather inviting exploration, perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s to savor a warm drink would be the perfect way to relish the evening. There\u2019s an understated magic to San Francisco today; it beckons you to step outside, lose yourself in its charm, and embrace the moment.",
