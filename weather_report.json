    "weather_report": "As the city sleeps under a veil of light clouds, the air carries the softness of a marine night, thick with the tranquility that seems to cradle the streets. The temperature lingers around a gentle 56 degrees, accompanied by a west-southwest breeze that whispers playfully through the alleys. Morning light will gradually sweep away the shadows, revealing a day poised to unfold in shades of soft blue and muted sunshine. With a high of 67, expect the warmth to gently settle across the city, with a cool breeze brushing through, offering an invitation to embrace a leisurely outdoor ritual in the heart of the bustling urban landscape.\n\nWhile fog may gently caress the hills, it will make way for clearer vistas as the hours unfurl. Those venturing out might find joy in strolling through the neighborhoods, perhaps savoring a quiet caf\u00e9 moment, where the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the crispness of the morning air. Layers are key; a light jacket or cardigan will provide comfort against the coolness that lingers, especially near the water. Today calls for simple pleasures\u2014be it a casual jaunt through Golden Gate Park or a moment lost in the pages of a favorite book while perched on a sun-warmed bench. The day is yours to savor, wrapped in the serene beauty that is uniquely San Francisco.",
