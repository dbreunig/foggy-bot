The sun will chase away any lingering hints of fog and the marine layer, leaving behind striking clarity that reveals the city\u2019s iconic landmarks from every vantage. While there may be a gentle breeze stirring in the afternoon, it will only enhance the day\u2019s inviting warmth, perfect for those yearning to explore the lively streets or enjoy a leisurely brunch outside.\n\nFor those contemplating how to best embrace the day, a smart yet casual ensemble will suit the lighthearted atmosphere\u2014perhaps a breathable shirt under a light cardigan for the transition from cool morning to sunny afternoon. A stroll through the Embarcadero, wandering past artisan vendors and food carts, would be a delightful way to immerse oneself in the essence of San Francisco, or perhaps a quiet moment with a book amidst the serene beauty of Golden Gate Park would be the ideal way to welcome the weekend.",
