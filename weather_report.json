    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air carries hints of that familiar chill, whispering reminders of the city\u2019s coastal embrace. The clouds blanket the sky, yet their presence is gentle, a veil rather than a barrier. With a low dipping around fifty-four degrees, the breeze, laced with the salt of the Pacific, dances with gusts that playfully tug at your clothing. Tonight unfolds with a subtle character, perfect for a comfortable sweater, perhaps layered over a light shirt to navigate the shifting temperatures.\n\nTomorrow promises a brighter disposition, as Friday invites a return to sunshine with a high reaching into the mid-sixties. The warmth, however, might yield to the cool respite of afternoon breezes, so it would be wise to keep a light jacket handy for your mid-day adventures. With the bay revealing its serene vistas, a stroll along the waterfront or an exploration of hidden nooks nestled among the city\u2019s eclectic neighborhoods would provide a satisfying retreat. Engage with the energy of the streets, but also take a moment to breathe in the salty air and watch as the sun casts its golden glow over the hills.",
