    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in the gentle embrace of clarity, unmarred by the cling of fog. The evening air, crisp and refreshing, hovers around a comfortable 52 degrees, stirred by a light west wind that dances through the streets, bringing a sense of vitality to the approaching night. Tonight\u2019s sky promises a serene backdrop, its vast expanse unfurling as mostly clear, allowing the twinkling lights of the city to emerge like scattered stars on the horizon.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the sun will rise with a warmth that nudges the day towards an inviting 64 degrees, casting a golden hue over the waking city. Winds will continue to flirt at 5 to 18 miles per hour, ensuring a pleasant freshness that complements the sunny disposition of the day. This combination of warm sunlight and gentle breeze creates an ideal opportunity for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet afternoon spent savoring a book at a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee complements the calmness of the surroundings. For those venturing outside, layered clothing would suffice\u2014perhaps a light sweater paired with a breathable shirt, as the warmth of the day and the cool evening air may call for a quick change before nightfall settles in.",
