    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a refreshing clarity, a welcome contrast to the more common fog-cloaked days. As the sun casts a gentle light, temperatures hover near a comfortable 64 degrees, gradually dipping closer to 62 as the day phases into evening. The west wind, crisp and invigorating, swirls through the streets with purpose, gusting at times to 26 mph, making each step feel alive with its touch.\n\nTonight, the sky will embrace a partly cloudy demeanor, inviting a comfortable low of 56 degrees beneath the still evening glow. The breeze will continue to dance about, slightly moderated but ever-present, fostering a cozy atmosphere perfect for a leisurely stroll. Given these conditions, it's wise to don layers\u2014a light sweater or a jacket will suffice as the night cools. Consider seeking out a warm caf\u00e9 or perhaps gathering with friends for an impromptu outdoor gathering, the kind that fosters laughter and conversation, reminiscent of summer\u2019s last whispers.",
