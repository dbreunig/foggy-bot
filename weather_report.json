The clouds drift above, mostly shrouding the moonlight while a south-southwest wind whispers through the city streets, teasing the edges of light jackets and sweaters. Those venturing out should prepare for a slight dampness, perhaps peering out with an umbrella, just in case the sky delivers on its promise of a sprinkle.\n\nThe dawn tomorrow might bring mixed blessings\u2014a high near 60 with a resemblance of sun filtering through the clouds. A 50% chance of rain may yet linger, hinting at the playful interplay between light and shadows overhead. As the day unfolds, the majestic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge may peek through, but be prepared for the presence of fog rolling in from the bay, enveloping the city in a gentle embrace, softening the sharp edges of urban life. Dressing in layers will be wise; a light coat paired with a touch of color might just add to the charm of the day. Consider an afternoon stroll through Golden Gate Park, where the muted greens can be a solace amidst the bustling city, or perhaps a stop at a cozy caf\u00e9 where warmth and good company can ward off the chill.",
