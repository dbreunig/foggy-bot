    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon sun spills golden light over the city, cloaked in an invigorating embrace of gently moving air. The sky, a rich canvas of blue, invites those who wander through the streets, with temperatures, though mild, offering a welcome warmth amidst the cooling breezes. As the day progresses, however, a transformation is on the horizon, with hints of patchy drizzle drifting in after midnight\u2014an ethereal reminder of the ocean's proximity. The evening will usher in an overcast blanket, holding the warmth close yet softening the vibrant daylight.\n\nThough the horizon may shimmer with warmth now, one should be prepared for the chill that moderate winds and encroaching clouds will bring later. A light jacket or sweater will strike the right chord between comfort and style, allowing for an easy transition from the clear sunlit streets into the evening's more subdued allure. Considering the temperate surroundings, a stroll through the nearby parks or along the water's edge could awaken the senses, while a leisurely stop at a cozy caf\u00e9 will complete the day's gentle rhythm, offering comfort as the city settles into the dusk.",
