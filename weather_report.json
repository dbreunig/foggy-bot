    "weather_report": "As the dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the crisp morning air carries the promise of a pleasant day, albeit tinged with the remnants of last night\u2019s slight drizzle. Presently, wisps of fog linger near the Golden Gate, a gentle reminder of the marine layer that often caresses this iconic city. The sky, painted in soft pastels, is slowly transitioning to a shimmering blue, hinting at the sunshine that\u2019s soon to brighten the day ahead.\n\nAs the morning advances, the forecast promises a sunny embrace with temperatures climbing comfortably, inviting residents and visitors alike to step outside and savor the warmth. A gentle breeze stirs, rustling the leaves and lending an invigorating touch, perfect for leisurely strolls through neighborhood parks or along the waterfront. Attire should reflect the day's erratic temperament; layering will be key, with light jackets giving way to short sleeves as the sun claims its territory. For those inclined towards the outdoors, an exploration of the local caf\u00e9s or the picturesque trails of the Presidio could offer a delightful escape as the city sheds its morning shroud of clouds.",
