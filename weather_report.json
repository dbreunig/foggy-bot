    "weather_report": "A gentle morning unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, where the sun makes its slow ascent, casting a warm glow across the undulating streets and iconic skyline. The day promises to be mostly sunny, with temperatures hovering in the upper fifties, dipping slightly as afternoon approaches. A brisk west-northwest wind whispers through the city, carrying the scent of the ocean, yet softening the chill that lingers in the air. The clarity is striking today, unmarred by fog, revealing the graceful arches of the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance, inviting one to pause and admire the beauty of the landscape.\n\nAs the evening draws near, a pleasant coolness will settle, offering a perfect backdrop for an evening stroll. A light jacket should suffice for those venturing out to enjoy a brief escape at a local coffee shop or perhaps a quiet read in one of the city's lovely parks. With the sky adorned in soft hues of fading daylight, it is a delightful chance to indulge in the simple pleasures of the city, whether it be watching the sun dip beyond the horizon or engaging in an effortless conversation with a friend over a warm beverage.",
