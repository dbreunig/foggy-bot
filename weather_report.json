    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a generous sun, casting a warm glow across the skyline, and beckoning you to step outside. With temperatures that hover pleasantly around 74 degrees and a gentle west wind sweeping through at around 16 mph, the air feels crisp yet inviting. The day appears mostly clear, free from fog's customary embrace, rendering a stunning view of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and the cityscape far below. The marine layer remains an afterthought today, serving only as a distant memory rather than an intruder in your afternoon plans.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent, the evening promises to maintain that refreshing clarity transitioning to a low around 58, perfect for a light jacket. When choosing your attire, think layered, with perhaps a light scarf to ward off the coolness that sneaks in as twilight approaches. This enchanting weather sets the stage for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering Bay reflects the golden hues of the setting sun, or perhaps a quiet afternoon spent in one of the city's many parks, savoring the last moments of summer warmth. As day melds into night, consider settling in at a cozy caf\u00e9, where conversations flow like the gentle bay breeze, making this afternoon a simple yet rich tapestry of San Francisco life.",
