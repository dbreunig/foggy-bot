    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun casts a warm glow throughout the city, setting a vibrant stage for the day ahead. High temperatures, reaching about 70 degrees, offer a pleasant comfort that will gradually wane to around 65 as afternoon settles in. The gentle west-southwest breeze whispers through the streets, a soft reminder of the sea, but as one gazes toward the horizon, the clarity of the day comes apparent. There is a faint marine layer lingering, teasing the edges of the coastal skyline, yet it does not overshadow the charm of San Francisco\u2019s famed architecture or the inviting vibrancy of its parks.\n\nAs the evening approaches, partly cloudy skies will embrace the city, with lows dipping to around 52 degrees. The air will carry a gentle crispness, suggesting a light sweater might be the perfect companion as people make their way to cozy restaurants or enjoy a peaceful stroll along the Embarcadero. For those wandering through neighborhood caf\u00e9s or bookshops, the day presents itself not just as an invitation to venture out, but as a chance to savor the simple joys\u2014the ease of a sunny afternoon, the charm of a city in motion, and the serenity that dusk brings.",
