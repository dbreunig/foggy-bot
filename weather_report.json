    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, the sky transforms into a canvas painted with soft pastels, marking the end of a cool day. Tonight, expect mostly clear skies embracing the city, with temperatures dipping to a crisp 49 degrees stirred gently by a light breeze from the south-southwest. The clarity is a stark contrast to the often foggy evenings the city is known for, allowing the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge to stand boldly against the fading light, while the marine layer lingers just beyond the city\u2019s edges, reminding us of its persistent presence.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the sun will rise with a promise of warmth, peeking through the clouds to grace the day with mostly sunny skies and a high approaching 62. The gentle southwest winds will stir up a mild day, ideal for those inclined to embark on leisurely strolls. As for attire, layering is sensible; a light jacket or sweater will provide comfort against the evening chill while a short-sleeved shirt may suffice during the day\u2019s warmth. It\u2019s a perfect opportunity to explore the lesser-known nooks of the city\u2014maybe a charming caf\u00e9 tucked away on a quiet street or a small park where you can soak in the skyline\u2019s beauty. As the light fades into twilight, indulge in a quiet moment, perhaps with a book or a friend, while the city glimmers beneath the stars.",
