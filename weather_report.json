    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco holds a charming yet reserved disposition, hovering around a gentle 62 degrees beneath a predominantly sunny sky. The west wind sweeps through with a refreshing insistence, at times gusting enough to ruffle leaves and stir the air. As the day mellows towards evening, a patchy drizzle is anticipated post-2 a.m., cloaking the city in a soft, atmospheric mist. With a low of around 56 degrees, tonight promises to cradle the lingering warmth of the afternoon but with an invitation for cozy layers as the clouds gather.\n\nThe presence of fog has yet to envelop the skyline, allowing the Golden Gate Bridge and the city\u2019s architectural wonders some clarity and ease of view. The marine layer, however, lurks just along the horizon, suggesting that a light jacket or a layered sweater would serve as an amiable companion for anyone venturing out. This is a day suited for a contemplative stroll, perhaps through the quiet trails of Lands End or a meander along the waterfront, basking in the serene juxtaposition of the bright day and the subtle hint of rain about to descend. Or, one might settle into a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink as the city prepares for a tranquil nightfall colored with the promise of a gentle drizzle.",
