    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a soft embrace of clouds hangs in the sky, cloaking the city in a muted light. The air is cool and carries with it the faint promise of drizzle that may drift in just after dawn. The temperature dips gently, settling around a comfortable 56 degrees, while a west-southwest breeze stirs through, whispering at 7 to 16 miles per hour, occasionally kicking up to 23 mph, adding a brisk charm to the atmosphere. The forecast nudges along a 20% chance of precipitation, hinting at just a touch of moisture floating in from the coast.\n\nOn Tuesday, a similar ambiance is expected to unfold: mostly cloudy skies with a slight chance of morning drizzle, barely enough to dampen spirits. The day will greet San Francisco with highs nearing 63 degrees, retreating to around 61 as the afternoon wanes, making layers a wise choice. A light jacket or sweater would serve well against the cool breeze and the sporadic chill of potential drizzle. As this quiet day rolls out, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to one of the cozy cafes tucked away in North Beach, with time spent savoring a warm beverage while observing the ebb and flow of city life against the backdrop of a hushed, cloudy day.",
