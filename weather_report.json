There\u2019s a slight chance of drizzle lingering in the air, hinting at a refreshment brought by the night. With temperatures sitting modestly around 56 degrees, a light breeze from the west southwest sways the leaves and carries the crisp scent of the Pacific. The wind's whispers, at times gusting up to 22 mph, create a delicate symphony that intermingles with the distant sounds of the bay.\n\nAs we turn towards tomorrow, the morning may greet us with a similar sentiment\u2014a fleeting chance of drizzle before the sun\u2019s embrace transforms into partly sunny skies. Expected highs will nudge near 64 degrees, as temperatures dip slightly in the afternoon's embrace. It promises to be a day perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the cozy local cafes, where warmth and comfort await over a cup of something steamy. Dressing in layers will serve you well, as the temperatures shift capriciously; a light jacket or sweater should suffice against the chill, while a comfortable shirt will keep you at ease as the sun peeks through the clouds. Enjoy this serene city, where the ambiance invites small adventures and moments of quiet reflection.",
