    "weather_report": "As night falls over Downtown San Francisco, a thick veil of rain shrouds the city in a muted stillness. Clouds brood overhead, casting a gray pall that absorbs the vibrant colors of the urban landscape. The chill in the air settles in, hinting at temperatures that will gently rise to around 51 degrees, coaxing a heavy reliance on layers as the wind whispers through the streets at 9 to 18 mph, gusting even more fiercely, up to 36 mph. Those venturing outside should take care to wrap themselves in a waterproof jacket, perhaps with a cozy scarf to fend off the biting dampness. \n\nTomorrow promises a delightful contrast, as rain likely gives way to the sun\u2019s gentle glow before long. The forecast hints at an enjoyable day with highs near 55 degrees and conditions highly favorable for a leisurely stroll through the cooler streets, should the clouds break. With the chance of lingering drizzle, an umbrella may still be a steadfast companion. Consider wandering into a local caf\u00e9 for a steaming cup of coffee, where you can bask in the warmth, watching the world outside shift from soggy to serene. Whether savoring the rising aromas of fresh pastries or contemplating the allure of a good book, tomorrow is beckoning with subtle invitations to embrace the calm following the storm.",
