    "weather_report": "As daylight plays its final moments above Downtown San Francisco, the city is cloaked in a gentle layer of clouds, signaling an impending change. The high of around sixty degrees today has been accompanied by a balmy breeze from the south, setting a mood that shifts as the sun wanes. Although any lingering sunlight has struggled against the clouds, the air carries with it the promise of rain, expected to usher in as evening descends. The delicate balance of sun and cloud hints at the potential for those intimate moments spent indoors, perhaps with a warm beverage in hand, as the sounds of the city softly fade into the night.\n\nTonight projects an intimacy that one might embrace with a layered wardrobe\u2014a light jacket layered over perhaps a soft sweater or long-sleeve shirt will offer comfort as the temperature teeters between the low fiftys and a slight rise overnight. The evening sky will deepen, buoyed by an 80% chance of rain after 11 PM, with whispers of raindrops on windowpanes. For the evening\u2019s pursuits, consider the quiet pleasures of a cozy caf\u00e9 or even a leisurely stroll through the neighborhoods, where the air will carry the scent of damp earth and promise the beauty of spring. Such nights in San Francisco possess a charm, as the lights of the city reflect off the slick streets, painting a picture only true San Franciscans understand from experience\u2014one that invites you to explore, yet remains graciously aware of its relentless winds and unpredictable rains.",
