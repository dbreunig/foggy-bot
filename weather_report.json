    "weather_report": "As night falls over Downtown San Francisco, the skies remain mostly clear, inviting whispers of cool air as the temperature drifts to a comfortable 56 degrees. There\u2019s a gentle breeze from the west-southwest, playful enough to stir the leaves but calm enough for a leisurely evening stroll. The expanse of sky above is largely unblemished, transforming from the fading hues of twilight to a velvety canvas that pinpricks the darkness with distant city lights.\n\nTomorrow, expect the sun to rise auspiciously, bringing warmth that will push the temperature to a pleasant 66 degrees before it eases back into the moderate embrace of 64 in the afternoon. A brisker wind will add some character to the day, with gusts reaching up to 23 mph, perfect for invigorating the mind and spirit. There\u2019s little indication of the infamous San Francisco fog, which often clings to the coast; instead, it seems the marine layer has opted for another night of repose.\n\nFor those venturing outside, a light jacket or sweater would offer just the right touch of warmth against the cool breeze, particularly if your evening plans stretch into the later hours or head towards the waterfront. A casual walk through the city streets might lead to delightful discoveries, whether it\u2019s an impromptu jazz set at an underground venue or the quiet charm of a park bench, providing the perfect spot for reflection. Perhaps a cozy caf\u00e9 with gentle lighting beckons, offering respite from the bustling world outside, where a warm cup of coffee could be the perfect companion to a good book.",
