    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds with a gentle and intriguing allure. A curtain of partly sunny skies casts a modest light across the city, where temperatures hover around a pleasant yet cool 60 degrees. As the afternoon approaches, expect a subtle retreat of warmth, settling back toward 58. The west southwest breeze, dancing between 8 and 14 miles per hour, carries with it the occasional gust, playfully tugging at the edges of your clothing.\n\nTonight invites a shift towards greater cloud cover, with temperatures lightly cradling the night at around 53. The winds will soften, yet still rustle with a charm as they blow at 7 to 13 miles per hour. As you navigate the streets, you might notice a hint of fog beginning to settle, creating a soft veil over the iconic architecture; it adds an air of mystery while gently rolling over the hills. Dressing in layers is advisable\u2014think a light jacket or sweater that can be easily shed as the sun finds its way through the clouds. This weather calls for meandering strolls along the Embarcadero or popping into a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink while the day unfolds.",
