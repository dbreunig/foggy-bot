    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of gray hangs low, enveloping the skyline in a soft haze. With the temperature hovering around the high sixties and gently sinking towards the late afternoon, the air feels damp, whispering of the marine layer that's rolled in. The west wind carries a cool breath, but it's not harsh; rather, it feels like an invitation to embrace the day's overcast charm. Expect patchy fog to weave its way through the city as twilight approaches, cloaking the bridges and towers in a thick embrace, rendering those striking views momentarily elusive.\n\nFor those venturing out, layers are your closest friend. A light jacket paired with a cozy sweater will provide comfort against the coolness creeping in with the fog. Activities such as a leisurely stroll through one of the city\u2019s quieter neighborhoods or finding respite in a caf\u00e9, sipping on a warm brew while watching the clouds drift, seem perfect for this weather. The day's subtle drama encourages an exploration of the hidden corners of the city, where the atmosphere feels alive with a soft, muted rhythm, accompanied by the gentle sounds of distant traffic and muffled conversations.",
