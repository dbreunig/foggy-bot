    "weather_report": "As daylight strolls through Downtown San Francisco, it ushers in a mostly sunny canvas brushed with the soft warmth of highs nearing 65. A gentle west-southwest breeze wanders through the streets at a brisk 13 to 24 mph, occasionally dancing with gusts as bold as 30 mph. The afternoon is likely to see temperatures slide to around 63, bringing a refreshing coolness that hints at the transition from day to evening. \n\nTonight, expect a gentle shift into mostly cloudy skies that cradle a nighttime low around 57. The winds will hold close, continuing from the west-southwest, maintaining their cool embrace. The city, adorned in its familiar fog-laden mystery, offers glimpses of clarity amid the gentle drift of marine layer curtains. For those tempted to explore, a light jacket will accompany you well in the early evening, while perhaps a long-sleeve shirt could provide just enough comfort as the lingering tendrils of fog creep closer. In this quintessential San Francisco weather, a stroll along the Embarcadero could reveal the lovely contrast of the illuminated bay against the muted skyline\u2014an evening spent meandering through the soft glow of streetlamps and watching the ebb of the water could be delightful.",
