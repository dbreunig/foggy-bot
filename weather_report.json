    "weather_report": "As the twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, a serene clarity emerges, with stars beginning to punctuate the velvety sky. Tonight's cool embrace hovers around 56, kissed gently by the north-northwest breeze that whispers softly at six miles per hour. The expansive horizon remains unclouded, allowing for glimpses of the twinkling lights that dance upon the bay. That familiar marine layer, which often blankets the city, seems to have withdrawn, leaving an invitation for night owls to relish the crisp air.\n\nAs Tuesday unfolds, warm hues will greet the morning. Expecting a high near 77, the day promises to invite the city dwellers outdoors for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet read at one of the park gazebos. A light jacket will suffice early in the day, transitioning to short sleeves when the sun warms its way to mid-afternoon. The charm of San Francisco lingers in the air; a day ideal for exploring the nooks of neighborhoods like North Beach, sipping coffee while savoring the easy pace of life unfolding before you.",
