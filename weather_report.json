    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun beams down, casting a warmth that hints at summer while the gentle breeze dances through the streets. With a high reaching around 74, the weather feels particularly inviting as the day unfolds, shifting to an expected temperature of around 72 later on. The skies remain mostly clear, adorned by a few soft clouds that drift lazily, hinting at the delightful transition into the evening. Tonight, the temperature will dip to a cozy 57, providing a cool respite as the light fades and the stars begin to appear. The wind, a steady companion, whispers from the west southwest, adding a touch of freshness to the air.\n\nThe clarity of the day invites leisurely strolls and casual outdoor pursuits. Perhaps one could seek a charming caf\u00e9 for a late afternoon coffee, or meander through one of the numerous parks, allowing the warmth of the sun to wrap around like an embrace. As evening creeps in and the chill settles, a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the cool breeze. This is a moment to relish the golden glow of sunset against the iconic skyline, capturing the vibrant spirit of the city as day turns to night.",
