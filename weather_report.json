Tonight\u2019s atmosphere is marked by a few lingering clouds, with their shadows barely hinting at the warmth still clinging to the 53-degree air. The west-southwest breezes, ranging from a light 7 to a brisk 21 mph, weave through the streets, offering a refreshing embrace that invites a cozy layer\u2014a light jacket or perhaps a soft scarf would be wise, especially with unexpected gusts occasionally stirring up the evening chill.\n\nTomorrow emerges with the promise of a brighter disposition, revealing a mostly sunny day with highs climbing to about 66 degrees. The soft descent into the afternoon will see temperatures settle around 64, ideal for outdoor pursuits. There will be no dense fog to obscure the city\u2019s charms, making it a perfect time for a leisurely walk along the waterfront or a quiet moment in one of the many surrounding parks. Picture dining at a caf\u00e9 with an outdoor patio, practicing the simple art of people-watching as the gentle winds dance through your hair. The clarity of tomorrow paints a vivid canvas, a delightful day to savor the splendor of San Francisco, with its breathtaking sights and the soft whispers of the bay.",
