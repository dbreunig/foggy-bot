    "weather_report": "As the sun dips below the horizon, Downtown San Francisco finds itself wrapped in a cloak of gentle clouds, a precursor to the night ahead. The temperature rests comfortably around 52 degrees, with a soft westerly breeze whispering through the streets at a leisurely 3 to 8 mph. Its coolness invites a moment of reflection, perfect for a stroll beneath the haze, savoring the serene glow of city lights punctuated against the darkening sky. Although the fog is still lingering, it is not overwhelming; a hint of mystery adds to the evening's charm.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the morning promises a bright awakening, with a sun that will rise to cast warmth upon the city. Anticipate a high near 66 degrees, a perfect contrast to the coolness of night. By afternoon, temperatures may drop slightly, settling around a mild 64 degrees, as a light southwest wind picks up, swirling around in a comfortable embrace. For those venturing out, a light jacket or sweater may suffice for the morning and evening, while a short-sleeved shirt will serve well for the sun-filled midday. The pleasant weather invites two choices: stroll along the Embarcadero, absorbing the day's relaxed vibe and artistry of street performances, or lose yourself in a local caf\u00e9, where a perfectly brewed cup of coffee awaits to cradle your hands and awaken your senses.",
