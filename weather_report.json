    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, the evening air carries with it a refreshing chill, perfectly in sync with the anticipated low of around 48. The gentle breeze whispers through the streets, stirring the soft edges of a partly cloudy sky. The west wind dances lightly at approximately 8 to 13 mph, with occasional bursts lending a sense of movement to the otherwise calm ambiance. The clarity remains surprisingly sharp, despite hints of fog clinging to the distant bridges and hills, inviting introspection rather than chaos.\n\nTomorrow promises a delightful shift as the sun claims its rightful place in the sky, forecasting a high near 64 degrees for those eager to embrace the day. As the coast\u2019s marine layer recedes, the sun will cast a warm golden hue upon the city, infusing life into its vibrant streets and inviting solitary wanderings or leisurely strolls. When preparing for the day, dress in layers to navigate the subtleties of morning chill and midday warmth\u2014think a light sweater or jacket, paired with breathable fabrics as the sun asserts its presence. Find solace in a quiet coffee shop, sip a warm brew while watching the world awaken, or perhaps take a relaxed walk along the Embarcadero to soak in the sights and sounds of a new day unfurling.",
