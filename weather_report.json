    "weather_report": "A gentle breeze carries the warmth of a sunny afternoon as Downtown San Francisco basks under clear skies. The temperature is perfectly comfortable, hovering near the mid-seventies and easing into a pleasant coolness as the day unfolds. The view is uninterrupted, with the iconic Golden Gate Bridge standing proud against a canvas of blue, unmarred by fog or haze. The brisk west wind whispers through the streets, offering a refreshing contrast that dances with every breath taken outdoors.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will remain mostly clear, inviting the night to descend gently with a low around fifty-one. The persistent winds, though softened, will still be present, wrapping the city in their cool embrace. Dressing in layers is advisable; light sweaters or jackets will suit the shift from day to night, as well as perhaps a scarf to catch the evening chill. For today, a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely bike ride across the bridge seems fitting\u2014embracing the glorious weather before the night settles in. There\u2019s a tranquility in the air that beckons one to simply be present, to enjoy the beauty of the city that thrives under clear skies.",
