    "weather_report": "The afternoon air in Downtown San Francisco is marked by clarity and warmth, a welcome change from the fog that often cloaks the city. With the sun casting its gentle glow and temperatures hovering around a pleasant 65 degrees, the brisk west wind whispers at 17 mph, carrying with it the promise of a refreshing day. As you gaze up, the sky is an expansive blue canvas, unmarred by the usual marine layer, laying bare the grandeur of the Golden Gate and the sprawling neighborhoods below.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect the temperatures to ease into the mid-50s, accompanied by a clear sky that invites evening strolls. The northwesterly winds will shift gently, providing a chill that may warrant a light jacket. To fully embrace the beauty of the city, consider wandering through the park, enjoying a moment of tranquility as the sun sinks gradually behind the horizon. A visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s for a warm drink could perfectly cap off this lovely day, allowing you to savor the crispness of the evening air while taking in the city\u2019s sparkling lights.",
