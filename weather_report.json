    "weather_report": "In the quiet embrace of an overnight stillness, San Francisco prepares for dawn, the air crisp yet gracefully inviting. The low sky, mostly clear, holds a promise of brightness as the city stirs from its slumber. As the west-southwest wind whispers through the streets, one can almost hear the echoes of romance in the hills, hinting at the warmth of the sun that will soon gild the iconic skyline. Tomorrow, expect the sun to rise high, casting gleaming rays over the city, with a high not far from 58 degrees. The gentle breeze provides a soothing backdrop, caressing those who are fortunate to wander at this hour.\n\nAs the day unfolds, it maintains a charming clarity, free from the thick blankets of fog that so often shroud the Bay\u2014though the marine layer lies patiently offshore, a distant reminder of the fog\u2019s playful nature. For those venturing outside, layering is the key; a light jacket over a comfortable sweater will suffice as morning transforms into afternoon. Imagine strolling through the Haight, perhaps visiting a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or finding solace in a book at a sun-drenched park. Today is filled with subtle invitations to explore\u2014less the clamor of a busy tourist season and more a reflective day, perfect for those seeking to uncover the city\u2019s quieter joys.",
