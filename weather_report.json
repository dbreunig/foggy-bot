    "weather_report": "A gentle warmth wraps around Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, as the sun peeks through a soft cover of clouds, lifting spirits and casting an inviting glow. The day, with temperatures reaching a comfortable sixty-three degrees, carries a refreshing breeze from the west-southwest, rustling through the trees and adding a hint of vitality to the urban landscape. While the skies are mostly clear, the remnants of marine fog linger, suggesting that the coastline may still be shrouded in the soft embrace of the Pacific, evoking memories of past summers spent watching the waves crash against the sea wall.\n\nAs the evening approaches, the clouds will begin to drift into a partly cloudy demeanor, making way for a beautifully tranquil night. The temperatures will settle around fifty-two degrees, so a light jacket may be just the companion you\u2019ll want for any evening outings\u2014perfectly suited for a casual stroll along the waterfront or sipping a warm drink at a cozy caf\u00e9, letting the city\u2019s unique charm wash over you. With the winds steady around twelve to eighteen miles per hour, it\u2019s an ideal moment to step outside, whether to enjoy the sunset or catch up with a friend over dinner, embracing the enchanting rhythm of the city as day turns into night.",
