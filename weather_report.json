    "weather_report": "A gentle warmth embraces Downtown San Francisco today, as sunshine bathes the city in a soft glow, with temperatures hovering around a pleasant 65 degrees, gradually yielding to a cooler embrace of 63 by afternoon. The sky stretches wide and clear, free from the usual fog that sometimes cloaks the bridges and hills, allowing for unobstructed views of Alcatraz and the shimmering bay beyond. A light northwest breeze stirs with refreshing whispers, adding a delicate touch to the tranquil atmosphere.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the temperature will dip to around 51, inviting the wisps of a partly cloudy night. Attire should remain light yet layered; a fine sweater over a casual shirt will cater to the shifts of the day, while earlier, a stroll down the waterfront or some time spent sipping coffee al fresco could yield delightful moments of urban solitude amidst nature's backdrop. Perhaps consider visiting a local bookstore, where the soft rustle of pages can harmonize with the city's serene cadence, providing a perfect way to appreciate the beauty of this day in San Francisco.",
