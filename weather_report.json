    "weather_report": "As the sun sets over Downtown San Francisco, the sky deepens into a canvas of gentle hues, hinting at the tranquility and clarity that envelops the city this evening. With a crisp low temperature settling around 53 degrees, a soft west-southwest breeze wanders through the streets, carrying with it the fresh scent of the bay. Tonight promises to be mostly clear, inviting stargazers to admire the celestial display, while the wind playfully dances through the bustling avenues.\n\nLooking ahead to Juneteenth, expect a sunny embrace with a high reaching near 62 degrees, before a gradual decline as afternoon approaches. The active winds will range from gentle to brisk, a reminder that even in sunshine, San Francisco\u2019s weather retains its capricious nature. Though fog can often blanket the city, tonight is free from that familiar embrace, allowing for clearer views across the skyline. As you prepare for this pleasant evening and the sunny day to follow, layered clothing is advisable, allowing for comfort amid the shifting temperatures. This is the kind of weather that beckons you to wander through the vibrant local streets, perhaps stopping at a cozy caf\u00e9 to enjoy a warm drink or venturing into one of the many green spaces to relish the cool evening air.",
