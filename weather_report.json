    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, this afternoon greets you with a bright flourish, the sun bathed in a gentle glow that descends upon the cityscape. The temperatures hover pleasantly in the lower sixties, whispering to you a promise of mildness as the higher warmth softly grants way to a mild embrace. A light breeze wafts from the west-southwest, adding a delicate movement to the serenity of the day, as if the air itself were taking a leisurely stroll.\n\nTonight, the skies are expected to don a partly cloudy attire, a veil that might offer a cozy backdrop as the temperature dips to around fifty-one. The warmth of the day softly recedes, making room for a coolness that encourages a light sweater or jacket, perfect for an evening in the city. The fog dances effortlessly along the fringes, a gentle reminder of the coastal embrace, curling up near the bay but not obstructing the city\u2019s sparkle. With the day\u2019s clarity, consider a leisurely walk along one of the waterfront paths or perhaps a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, absorbing the pulse of the city as it settles into the evening.",
