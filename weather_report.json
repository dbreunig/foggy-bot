    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle whisper of clouds lingers above, painting the sky with a soft, muted brilliance. The temperature rests comfortably around fifty-five degrees, enfolding the city in a mild embrace accentuated by a light breeze, gliding in from the southwest at about nine miles per hour. This quiet interlude of darkness will yield to a sunlit symphony as dawn breaks, promising a bright Friday. Slanting rays will soon warm the air, nudging temperatures toward a pleasant seventy, though a slight coolness may creep in by afternoon, settling back to around sixty-seven. \n\nAs the day unfolds, the sun will rule the sky with clarity, dispersing any lingering memories of fog that occasionally dance along the coast, though nothing too dramatic should be expected today. Those venturing outdoors might find the light wind comforting, perfect for a leisurely stroll or perhaps a mid-morning coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9, where one could savor the atmosphere while wrapped in a light sweater or a casual jacket. The charm of the city beckons; perhaps a visit to the local library or a quiet gallery would suit the serene day, allowing for moments of reflection amidst the bustle. One may also wander down to the waterfront, embracing the gentle breeze, with the promise of a splendid, unclouded afternoon ahead.",
