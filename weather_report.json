    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the air is vibrant and crisp, a welcoming companion for this holiday afternoon. The sun casts its warm glow over the cityscape, bathing the iconic architecture in a gentle light. The high temperature hovers just around 62\u00b0F, a quintessentially San Francisco summer day where the warmth is tempered by a westward breeze, whipping through the streets at a brisk pace, occasionally gusting as if sharing in the holiday spirit. The bright blue of the sky stretches above, unmarred by fog, allowing for sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the hills beyond, which remain distinct against the backdrop of the bay.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the temperatures will dip to a cozy 52\u00b0F, so dressing in layers would serve you well\u2014think light sweaters or jackets to fend off the evening chill. With the weather's pleasant clarity, it\u2019s an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps indulging in a small caf\u00e9 treat while enjoying the inky blues of the water meeting the horizon. A quiet picnic at one of the nearby parks would also be a delightful way to soak in the lingering warmth, while the sound of laughter and the aroma of barbecues waft through the air, celebrating the simplicity of a perfect summer day in the city.",
