    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, this afternoon dawns bright and full of promise, with the golden sun casting its warm glow over the city's iconic silhouettes. The high hovers near a comfortable 67 degrees, making it an inviting day for a stroll along the waterfront, where the gentle breeze whispers through the air, shifting between subtle and refreshing. However, as the day wears on, a modest fall in temperature beckons a light jacket or sweater, especially as the sun begins its descent. Tonight, the sky will transition to a partly cloudy canvas, but currently, the expansiveness above remains largely clear, hinting that fog is playing a welcome game of hide-and-seek today.\n\nWhile the marine layer is hovering on the outskirts, it hasn\u2019t claimed the city just yet, offering residents and visitors alike a chance to bask in the sunlight without the usual shrouded chill. The day rings with possibilities\u2014a visit to one of the local cafes for a leisurely afternoon bite, or perhaps a jaunt through the vibrant streets filled with art and culture, might well suit the mood. As twilight approaches, the soft blanket of clouds will add some intrigue to the evening, but the essence of San Francisco's charm will remain intact. A light layer for the evening hours will suffice to keep the coolness at bay, allowing you to enjoy the city\u2019s pulse long into the night.",
