    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this Tuesday, Downtown San Francisco wakes to a partly cloudy sky. The air is crisp, brushed by a gentle breeze from the southwest, and the low temperature suggests a tranquil embrace of the city as it stirs awake. As the sun inches toward the horizon, the weather promises a mostly sunny day, with the temperature anticipated to peak near an inviting 64 degrees, though it will subtly decrease in the afternoon, softly cradling the city's pulse.\n\nThere is a sense of clarity in the air, a lingering hint of the marine layer that often graces the Golden Gate area, while the undulating hills of San Francisco gradually break free from the shroud of night. As the daylight builds, one might find it easy to embark on a leisurely stroll through the vibrant streets, perhaps savoring a fresh pastry from a local caf\u00e9 as the city begins to bustle. For those planning outdoor activities, layers would be wise; a light jacket is perfect for the morning\u2019s chill, giving way to a t-shirt or a short-sleeved shirt as the sun ascends high in the sky. Overall, it beckons a day of quiet enjoyment, inviting residents to lose themselves in the gentle rhythm of the day, moving through the essence of San Francisco in all its serene charm.",
