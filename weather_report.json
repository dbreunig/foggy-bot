    "weather_report": "As the world drifts deeper into the night in Downtown San Francisco, a tranquil stillness envelops the city, interrupted only by the soft murmur of the breeze. The skies are clear, adorned with a tapestry of stars, and the cool night air, brisk and invigorating, hints at a low temperature around 46 degrees. As dawn heralds a new day, it promises sunshine bathing the city in a warm glow, though temperatures will only reach a mild 60. A gentle northwest wind dances at 3 to 12 mph, adding a delightful chill that feels refreshing against the skin.\n\nTomorrow unfolds with an invitation to indulge in simple pleasures. Feel free to don a light jacket or a layered outfit, as the morning air remains cool and the sun will gradually warm the streets, easing the chill by midday. The promise of a clear, sunlit day awaits you, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a serene moment in one of the city's iconic parks. Perhaps sipping a warm coffee while taking in the sights of the Bay, where the glimmer of water brings forth a sense of peace and reflection. Enjoy this splendid weather while it lasts, as it beckons with the charm of a calm spring day in a city that thrives on its vibrant energy.",
