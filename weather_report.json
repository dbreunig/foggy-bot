    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfurls under a radiant sun, casting gentle warmth over the city. Temperatures hover near a crisp 62 degrees, and the reassuring gusts from the west whisper through the streets at around 25 mph, providing both a refreshing embrace and a dance of light shadows. The skies remain largely clear, a canvas painted in soft blue, allowing for views that seem to stretch into infinity\u2014a perfect backdrop for the majestic architecture that graces the landscape. Notably absent is the fog that often veils the Bay, allowing the Golden Gate Bridge to stand proudly, devoid of the customary marine layer that frequently sweeps in.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the mercury will dip to around 52 degrees, accompanied by a more temperate breeze from the west northwest. Though the evening remains mostly clear, dressing in layers is wise; a light jacket would serve well against the cooling air, especially as the sun dips below the horizon. With such splendid weather at hand, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the gentle lapping of the bay provides a serene backdrop. Alternatively, enjoy a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink while watching the city transition from day to night, as twinkling lights begin to pepper the urban landscape.",
