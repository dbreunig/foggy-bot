Currently, the skies remain partly cloudy, creating a tranquil backdrop after a day that saw the city bathed in a soft glow as the coastline merged with a subtle marine layer. With temperatures dipping to a low of 48 degrees, one might appreciate the comforting weight of a light jacket or sweater as they step outside, the west-southwest wind whispering through the streets at a leisurely pace.\n\nLooking ahead, Sunday promises a delightful transformation; the morning will give way to a mostly sunny sky, the kind of day that invites citizens to stroll through the vibrant streets, perhaps stopping by a cozy caf\u00e9 or leaning against a railing to watch the sailboats dance on the bay. As temperatures inch up to a high of 64, expect a slight drop by the afternoon, hinting at a gentle shift in the breeze. This is no day for hasty plans; rather, it beckons quiet moments\u2014a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park, or engaging in conversations with friends while savoring the flavors of a local eatery. Embrace the day with layers that allow you to adapt to the shifting warmth and cold, ensuring you remain snug amidst the lingering coolness from the sea.",
