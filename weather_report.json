    "weather_report": "As the evening descends over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle breeze carries the crisp promise of a cool night ahead. The air hangs with a slight edge of moisture from the earlier chance of rain, although the clouds have mostly retreated, granting the sky a spacious clarity that contrasts starkly with the city\u2019s twinkling lights. With temperatures nestling around the mid-forties, the northwest winds whistle through the streets, reminding anyone outside to button up against the chill and perhaps reach for a light jacket or a cozy scarf. \n\nLooking forward to tomorrow, the sun will rise apologetically behind the horizon, bringing with it a bright, cheerful warmth that promises a high of nearly sixty degrees, a fitting antidote to the cool evening. As the day warms to its apex, one can expect the temperatures to gently slide back down towards the end of the afternoon. The interplay of sun and wind paints the ideal setting for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet coffee at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, where the warmth of a cup can stave off the cooler gusts. Before the day departs, the picturesque outline of the Golden Gate Bridge will beckon outdoor wanderers, a call for exploration amidst a canvas of clear blue sky.",
