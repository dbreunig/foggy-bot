    "weather_report": "The evening breathes a gentle chill over Downtown San Francisco, a mix of cloud cover hanging gracefully in the sky. As twilight deepens, those clouds take on a muted gray, wrapping the city in a cozy embrace. A westward breeze unfurls, its whispers nudging the temperature down to a cool 50 degrees, making it a night where layers are a wise choice. Perhaps a light jacket or a soft scarf would suit the mood, ideal for strolling along the waterfront or sipping a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 while observing the ever-rolling fog that seems to creep in occasionally from the bay.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Friday, expect the sun to flirt playfully with the clouds, casting a soft glow over the landscape. The high will flirt with the mid-fifties, but the afternoon might see a subtle drop, hinting at the possibility of the marine layer making its presence felt. A casual day awaits\u2014perhaps a visit to a neighborhood bookstore or a leisurely walk through a nearby park where the muted sounds of the city can be enjoyed. As you navigate the streets, the attire of choice would be flexible, accommodating the fluctuating temperatures, while also leaving room for the unexpected joys of a city often shrouded in mystique.",
