    "weather_report": "The evening in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a clear sky, a tranquil scene bathed in soft twilight hues as the sun descends behind the cityscape. With a gentle west wind whispering through the streets, temperatures hover comfortably in the high 40s, making for a pleasant stroll along the Embarcadero or through the vibrant Mission District. This serenity promises a night where the stars may twinkle through a veil of crystal clarity, offering an inviting atmosphere for an evening out, perhaps at a cozy caf\u00e9 or a culinary gem.\n\nAs Friday dawns, one can look forward to a sunny, cheerful day with a high approaching 65 degrees, though it may dip slightly by afternoon. Dressed in layers, perhaps a light sweater over a t-shirt, one can fully embrace the day's warmth while preparing for a cool breeze that often accompanies the coastal charm. Ideal pursuits for the day include an art stroll through the galleries of SoMa, or a leisurely bike ride across the Golden Gate Bridge, where the expansive views become an exquisite backdrop to the pleasant weather. The absence of fog exemplifies the beauty of a clear spring day, enhancing the coastline's allure with its vibrant colors and compelling vistas.",
