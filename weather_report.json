    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the rain begins to softly murmur against the pavement, casting a gentle, reflective sheen on the city streets. The temperature hovers in a cool embrace, reminding us to wrap ourselves in layers as we step out. The winds, brisk and purposeful, whistle through the alleys, their becoming a steady companion to the nocturnal dance of raindrops. Cloud cover blankets the sky, thick and heavy, tinged with hints of gray that promise more moisture before the day\u2019s end.\n\nLooking ahead, the sun will shy away from making a grand entrance, hidden behind the mantle of clouds. Expect rain to continue its serenade until the late afternoon, with gusts picking up strength as the day unfolds. As you wander through the dampened neighborhood, it might be wise to don a waterproof jacket and comfortable shoes suitable for the slick sidewalks. Balmy, albeit wet, the day begs for quiet explorations, perhaps a visit to one of the city\u2019s cozy caf\u00e9s where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee can warm your spirit against the chill. Alternatively, a leisurely stroll through the nearby parks could reveal the soft stirrings of spring, with everything glistening anew and waiting for the sun\u2019s gentle touch.",
