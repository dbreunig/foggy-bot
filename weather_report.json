    "weather_report": "As dawn stretches its golden fingers over Downtown San Francisco, the air remains cool, offering a gentle reminder of winter\u2019s lingering embrace. The night gives way to a partly cloudy sky, soft and inviting, heralding a day that promises mostly sunny conditions. Expect the warmth of the sun to peak near the low sixties, though a playful wind from the north suggests a slight chill that may accompany the sun\u2019s ascent. \n\nThe marine layer has receded, its foggy tendrils only whispering around the edges of the city, allowing for better clarity as the day unfolds. It is the kind of weather that beckons one to draw breath deep into the fresh air, perhaps while taking a stroll along the Embarcadero or savoring a warm beverage at a favorite caf\u00e9. Dress in light layers to harness the day's warmth while remaining prepared for the cool breezes that may sweep through. With time on your hands and skies brightening, a morning spent wandering through the treasures of the Ferry Building or a cozy afternoon exploring the nooks and crannies of North Beach could turn this typical day into something unexpectedly delightful.",
