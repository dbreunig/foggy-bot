    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night drapes itself in a gentle cloak of clouds, creating a hushed ambiance as the city sleeps. The low temperature rests around a comfortable 52 degrees, coaxing those sensitive to the cool breeze into a light sweater or jacket. As dawn approaches, the world will begin to stir, revealing a Thursday that promises to be partially sunny, with the air warming slightly but still holding on to the refreshing chill of spring. Expect a high near 61 degrees, where the soft southwest winds will playfully rustle through the trees, whispering stories of warmer days to come.\n\nThe veil of fog, a staple of San Francisco's mornings, may linger in pockets, particularly near the Golden Gate, painting the landscape in a diffused, ethereal light. Yet, as the sunlight breaks through, it will gradually unveil the beauty of the city, turning the mist into glistening droplets of dew that cling to the edges of leaves and the sides of buildings. Today is one of those delightful days when one can savor simple pleasures: perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, engaging with local vendors at the farmers' market, or enjoying a quiet moment in a cozy caf\u00e9 with a steaming cup of coffee\u2014just enough to warm the fingers while watching the city awaken. Dress in layers; the cool air may brush against the skin but promises an inviting warmth when the sun takes command.",
