    "weather_report": "A gentle veil of clouds draws over Downtown San Francisco, hinting at the rain that will soon unfurl. The morning sky is a muted canvas, resembling a watercolor painting, the high peaks of Sutro Tower watching over the city with an expectant gaze. The promise of showers looms with a 50% chance of rain, and the temperatures quietly decline, settling into a cool embrace around 56 degrees. Blustery winds whisper through the streets, stirring the spirit of the day, yet the atmosphere is more refreshing than relentless.\n\nAs you navigate your day, it\u2019s wise to adapt to these capricious elements. A light, waterproof jacket would serve well, accompanied by layers\u2014perhaps a soft scarf to protect against the brisk breeze that often dances along Market Street. Many may find joy in seeking out cozy caf\u00e9s, warm drinks cradled in hand, or perhaps losing oneself among the aisles of a bookstore, the rain tapping a gentle rhythm against windows. While the skies may appear gloomy, there remains a charm in their mystery, a refreshing reminder of nature's unpredictable beauty.",
