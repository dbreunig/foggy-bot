    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a soft shroud of clouds blankets the city, cradling the cool, crisp air that heralds a tranquil start. The softly stirring breeze whispers through the streets at seven miles per hour, inviting residents to awaken and embrace the gentle warmth of the day ahead. With temperatures expected to reach a mild sixty-one, this Tuesday promises a pleasant reprieve from the chill hanging in the night sky.\n\nThe marine layer still lingers near the bay, curling around the Golden Gate Bridge, though it seems to be gradually retreating, allowing the sun to peek through in shy anticipation. Expect a patchwork of partly sunny skies to unfold, mixing subtle moments of brightness with the lingering softness of the clouds. For today, a light jacket or a cozy sweater layered over a simple shirt should suffice, shielding against any lingering coolness while remaining comfortable amid the mild weather. As the day unfolds, consider a leisurely stroll through the city\u2014exploring the hidden corners of a beloved caf\u00e9, or perhaps indulging in a quiet afternoon beneath the shade of a tree in one of the many parks. The day holds the promise of unhurried moments as the fog recedes, inviting both reflection and exploration.",
