    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco welcomes a night layered with the gentle embrace of clouds, the air tinged with the promise of a light drizzle whispering in the background. As the wind dances softly from the west-southwest, it carries the crispness of the ocean, stirring up just enough chill to prompt a thoughtful choice of attire. Though the low rests comfortably near 57 degrees, the occasional gusts remind one that being prepared means wrapping up a bit to ward off the coolness. \n\nAs the sun peeks out later, the city reveals itself in shades of blue and grey, an invitation to step outside, catch the refreshing hint of drizzle before noon, and find solace in the mostly sunny skies expected to emerge by afternoon. A high approaching 65 promises to warm the hearts of those who venture out, while the shifting temperatures encourage finding comfort in layers. Stray away from the predictable; consider a stroll through one of the city\u2019s quieter parks, or perhaps meandering through the art-filled corridors of a local gallery to savor the sweet moments of creativity before the day turns to evening again. The fog remains a fleeting memory, retreating into the distance, leaving behind a day ripe for exploration and reflection.",
