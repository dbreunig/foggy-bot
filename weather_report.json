    "weather_report": "The early hours in Downtown San Francisco offer a gentle embrace of patchy fog clinging to the edges of the bay, serenading the promise of the day ahead. As the sun prepares to rise above the horizon, glimpses of the iconic skyline peer through the mist, hinting at warmth beneath the cool blanket of morning. The temperature floats comfortably in the low 50s, a refreshing chill that encourages snug layers for those venturing out.\n\nAs Sunday unfolds, the fog gradually yields, revealing a mostly sunny disposition as the day progresses. By midday, skies will brighten, and the high will gently approach 66, eventually tapering to a lower, inviting 64 as afternoon settles in. Breezes from the south will flirt with warmth, whispering of possibilities. It\u2019s a splendid day to wander the neighborhoods, perhaps to explore the dimly lit corners of a caf\u00e9, or to take a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the bay and city unfold harmoniously. An ensemble of light jackets and layers will serve well, marrying comfort with the charm of a San Francisco morning. Let the fog remind you of the magic in transitions, and embrace the sunny joy that awaits.",
