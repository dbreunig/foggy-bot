    "weather_report": "As night creeps over Downtown San Francisco, the city finds itself cloaked in a blanket of clouds, punctuated occasionally by sporadic twinkling city lights. The forecast hints at the promise of rain, set to commence not long from now, heralded by the south-southwest winds whispering through the streets. With a low around a cool 51 degrees, the atmosphere is tinged with humidity, suggesting an impending soak that could catch the unwary.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the day will struggle against the weight of overcast skies, with rain expected to persist well into the afternoon. Expect temperatures to hover in the mid-50s, wearing a humidity-laden cloak that may leave one's skin feeling clammy. Today promises a full commitment from the clouds, with a steady fall of rain expected to accumulate substantially, possibly between three-quarters to an inch. The marine layer, while subdued, maintains its presence, hiding the iconic Golden Gate Bridge behind an impenetrable veil, with only hints of its grandeur peeking through at times. Don your raincoat or a waterproof jacket to brave the elements, and perhaps consider the warmth of a scarf to fend off the chill. \n\nThis gray, drizzling day is perfect for slipping into a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with baked goods\u2014an ideal moment to lose oneself in a good book or share soft words with friends. Alternatively, an afternoon spent exploring the indoor exhibits of a local museum could provide a refuge from the dampness outside. Whatever the choice, there's a certain charm in rainy days that invites reflection, and this blustery afternoon might just inspire a moment of quiet introspection beneath the comforting sound of falling rain.",
