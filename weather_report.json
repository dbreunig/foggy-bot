    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sky wears a gentle clarity, inviting warmth with a high settling near 61 degrees. The sun, unencumbered by heavy fog, radiates softly, kissed by a persistent west-southwest wind that dances lightly through the streets, making the world feel invigorated yet cozy. As the sun eases toward the horizon, the pleasant hint of early evening will usher in a partly cloudy night, where temperatures will retreat to around 52 degrees. The winds will shift to the south-southwest, continuing their gentle song.\n\nFor those seeking solace in the unfolding of the evening, it's an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps to indulge in a quiet moment at one of the city's many rooftop cafes, where the distant glow of the Golden Gate Bridge lingers as a reminder of the beauty that surrounds. Given the mild temperatures and refreshing breezes, a light jacket or sweater will suffice to embrace the coolness that sweeps in after sunset. This is a day that whispers of quiet adventures, inviting you to relish in the simplicity of the moment, tracing the outlines of the city with the warmth of companionship or the solitude of your thoughts.",
