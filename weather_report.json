    "weather_report": "The evening air in Downtown San Francisco carries an air of tranquility, as the day transitions from sunlight to a gentle darkness. With the temperature dropping into the mid-fifties, the evening is set to unfold under a mostly cloudy sky, with the remnants of warmth lingering just enough to keep one comfortable. A west-southwest breeze, vibrant yet soothing, dances through the streets, offering just enough coolness to embrace the signature coastal charm of the city.\n\nThe outlook for tonight promises a delightful cozy ambiance, ideal for a leisurely stroll through the streets or perhaps settling into a nearby caf\u00e9 for conversations or a good book. While the sunshine has faded, the clouds offer a soft cover, and for those seeking adventure, the nearby waterfront invites quiet moments as the waves murmur against the shore. A light jacket would be a wise choice, ensuring comfort against the evening chill, but there is no need for heavy layers; just enough to enjoy the gentle embrace of a San Francisco night.",
