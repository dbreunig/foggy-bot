    "weather_report": "As the sun casts a warm yet gentle glow over Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the city is bathed in a splendid clarity, revealing iconic landmarks with an inviting radiance. The predicted high of 68 degrees feels comfortably mild, perfectly suited for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet respite in one of the city\u2019s many parks. A brisk west wind dances through the streets, shifting between 7 to 16 mph, offering just enough of a chill to remind you that this is San Francisco. For those venturing out, a light jacket or layered sweater will suffice against the evening's cooler embrace.\n\nAs twilight descends, the sky will maintain its mostly clear demeanor, ushering in a low around 53. The fading daylight lays an alluring charm over the city, perfect for unwinding with a cup of coffee outdoors, perhaps at a caf\u00e9 with views of the bay. While a faint marine layer may linger close to the coast, obscuring the distant horizon slightly, the bustling city itself remains largely unobstructed by fog. This is a day to savor the subtle interplay of wind and sunlight, inviting a contemplative pause in the evening glow, while still providing the potential for a blissful evening out in the vibrant streets of San Francisco.",
