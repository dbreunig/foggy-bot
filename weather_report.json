    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco lies cloaked in a delicate shroud of patchy fog, a gentle reminder of the marine layer that rolls in with the tide. As the clock tips towards dawn, the world seems hushed, the air crisp and inviting, offering a low of 48 degrees. The faint stir of a northwest wind brushes softly against the face, whispering tales of the golden bridge draped in mist, waiting for the sun to peel back the layers of gray.\n\nAs the sun rises higher, the fog will retreat, giving way to a brilliant blue sky. By midday, it promises a delightful warmth, flirting with temperatures near 62. Dress in layers, for the cool mornings and mild afternoons call for a light jacket that can be shed as the sun courts the day. With the clarity that emerges, the city invites leisurely strolls along the waterfront, or perhaps engaging in a quiet caf\u00e9 moment with a warm cup, watching the world awaken in a swirl of color and life. The day unfolds like a gentle embrace, full of the promise of spring but firmly rooted in the rhythm of winter's lingering chill.",
