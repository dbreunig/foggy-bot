    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco brings a subtle interlude of partly sunny skies interspersed with a lingering chill that whispers of rain yet to come. As the golden hues of late afternoon engage in a fleeting dance with the clouds, the temperature hovers comfortably near sixty, tempered by a brisk southwest breeze. Although the chance of rain showers is modest, particularly before five, a light mist might tease the city, kissing the rooftops of homes and gliding over the bay with a gentle caress.\n\nAs twilight descends, expect the clouds to deepen into a steadfast blanket, transforming into a more assured promise of rain after eleven. With a low settling around fifty-three, it would be wise to don a light jacket, perhaps layered over a comfortable sweater\u2014a perfect attire for those evening strolls, where vibrant reflections shimmer on wet pavement. The tranquil sounds of the city seem to lull in the dusk, suggesting activities that lean into the cozier aspects of urban life, perhaps exploring a hidden caf\u00e9 or revisiting a favorite bookstore. As the city prepares for an evening of potential showers, a little warmth and a comforting cup of tea or coffee will serve as delightful companions to the unfolding season\u2019s soft embrace.",
