    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfurls under a blanket of sunshine, with the gentle warmth promising to reach near 66 degrees before settling into a milder 62, thanks to that reliable west-southwest breeze whipping through at a brisk 24 mph. There might be a touch of agitation in the air as gusts flirt with 28 mph, but let this not deter your spirit; it\u2019s a lively day befitting wanderlust and the gentle caress of a summer's whisper.\n\nAs the evening draws near, the sky will don a partly cloudy facade, with temperatures dipping to a comfortable 54 degrees. The winds will persist, calm yet persistent, at around 14 to 24 mph, ensuring that coolness lingers like a welcome guest. Today\u2019s conditions lack the heavy grip of fog that often grips the coast, allowing for an unobstructed view of the city\u2019s charms. As such, the clarity of the day invites you to embrace the outdoors\u2014perhaps consider an evening stroll to savor the crisp air or indulge in a gathering with friends at a local caf\u00e9, where laughter mingles with the fading daylight. Light layers will be your allies; a light jacket or cardigan should suffice as dusk approaches.",
