    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle mist clings to the air, weaving a thin veil of clouds around the city. The temperature is mild, cradling the low fifties, with hints of warmth promising to rise as the sun fully ascends. This morning\u2019s charm reveals a predominantly overcast sky, hinting at the marine layer\u2019s presence, which gracefully caps the towers and gentles the horizon. As we move into the day, the clouds will yield to an expanse of blue, turning to mostly sunny skies, perfect for those with plans to roam through the city\u2019s vibrant streets.\n\nWith winds whispering from the west at a tranquil pace, the day offers a delightful blend of coolness and warmth as the high approaches sixty-six. As the hours unfold, the golden sunlight will soften the edges of the day, making it ideal for leisurely outdoor pursuits. One might consider donning a light jacket in the cooler morning hours, but with the sun\u2019s full embrace by afternoon, a comfortable tee or shirt along with light layers would suffice. It\u2019s a day for exploring\u2014perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the sea air invigorates, or a quiet moment in a local caf\u00e9, sipping a cup of coffee while watching the world meander by.",
