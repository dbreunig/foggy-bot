With temperatures dipping to a gentle 54, the cool wind from the west-southwest, lightly brushing at 7 to 10 mph, hints at the evening\u2019s calmness. As you step outside, the slight chill beckons for a light jacket or a cozy sweater to wrap around your shoulders, perfect companions for a leisurely walk along the streets painted with the glow of city lights slowly igniting one by one.\n\nOn the morrow, the sun will peek through its curtain of clouds, promising a tableau of mostly sunny skies. The forecast brings a high near 64, gradually tapering to 62 as the afternoon unfolds\u2014a lovely invitation to explore the city, perhaps indulging in a casual brunch at a favorite caf\u00e9 before taking a stroll through a nearby park. The mild west-southwest winds, picking up to a flirtatious 13 mph, whisper tales of adventure. As fog dances playfully around the Golden Gate, the marine layer may wrap certain corners of the bay, but the clear view toward downtown offers clarity and vibrancy. Given the day's hilltop breezes and the softened sunlight, dressing in layers will equip you for the morning's briskness and the afternoon's warmth as you navigate the city\u2019s iconic charm without a care in the world.",
