    "weather_report": "In the stillness of early morning, Downtown San Francisco rests beneath a blanket of mostly cloudy skies, with whispers of rain lurking in the air, particularly as dawn approaches. The low temperature of 56 mingles with a gentle west-southwest breeze, making for a cool marine layer that nudges its subtle presence, stirring memories of fog-draped mornings by the bay. As the dawn light begins to break, the clouds hold a promise of scattered showers before the afternoon yields to moments of potential drizzles; the chance remains modest, hovering around 30%.\n\nAs you venture into the day, a light jacket or layered sweater would offer a cocoon of warmth against the brisk wind and cool air. The sky's muted palette might not invite long strolls along the waterfront, yet it sets the stage for contemplative caf\u00e9s and cozy corners where one can savor a cup of coffee and watch the world awaken. While the prominent landmarks will likely be softened by the clouds, there's charm in navigating through the city, perhaps meandering through quiet streets or exploring art galleries that beckon with promise. Although the visibility may be tempered by the morning marine layer, it imparts a reflective character to your day\u2014a tranquil canvas upon which you can paint your experiences.",
