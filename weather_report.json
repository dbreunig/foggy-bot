    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of clouds envelops the city, hovering gently above the iconic silhouettes of its skyline. The air feels cool, dipping to around 52 degrees, accented by a subtle breeze from the south that whispers of the moisture lingering in the atmosphere\u2014a reminder that the coastal fog is never far away. In the early hours, visibility is muddied, with the outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the hills beyond softened, suggesting a warming marine layer that could redefine the clarity by the morning light.\n\nAs Wednesday unfolds, expect an unassuming day, with a high near 58 accompanied by cloud cover, and perhaps a teasing sprinkle of rain as afternoon edges closer. The chance of a brief shower dances on the periphery at 20%, while the temperature gently transitions downwards, inviting a layered approach to dressing. A comfortable sweater paired with a light jacket will suffice against the gentle gusts and the chill that creeps in as the sun falls. In this atmospheric symphony, consider a stroll through the local cafes, where the scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm pastries beckons. Ambiance is soft, conversations hum as people gather, offering a comforting camaraderie against the backdrop of a moody urban landscape, perfect for curling up with a book or sharing stories with friends under the clouds.",
