    "weather_report": "As the city of San Francisco lies quietly under a mostly clear night sky, the faint whispers of a southwest breeze hint at the calmness that envelops its streets. Tonight, the temperature caresses the low fifties, inviting any late-night seekers of solace to wrap themselves in a light shawl or jacket, ensuring warmth against the cool air. Tomorrow promises a sun-drenched day, with bright rays kissing the pavements and a high lingering near the comfortable sixties. Expect a gentle afternoon decline in warmth; a subtle reminder that even the most vibrant days here can shift with the tides.\n\nThe delightful clarity of the evening sky hints at a pleasant day ahead, devoid of the usual coastal fog that sometimes plays hide-and-seek with the landmarks of the city. The marine layer, if it dares to venture in, seems to be holding back, making way for sun-dappled streets and the lively hum of daily life. The charm of San Francisco calls, suggesting a stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a leisurely caf\u00e9 visit, all while savoring the golden hues that accompany the sun\u2019s ascent. So, dress lightly yet thoughtfully, ready to embrace the freshness of the day, and be prepared to weave through the delights that unfold.",
