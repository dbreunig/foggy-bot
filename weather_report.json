    "weather_report": "Evening drapes a soft veil over Downtown San Francisco, the fading light casting a gentle golden hue across the skyline. Though the air carries a cool touch, it is pleasantly clear, offering a view where iconic landmarks stand defiantly against the backdrop of the undulating hills and distant waters. A thin band of fog lingers along the waterfront, softly hugging the base of the Golden Gate, a reminder of the marine layer's stealthy embrace that often creeps in after sunset.\n\nAs you step outside, the crispness brushes against your skin, a subtle prompting to layer your attire\u2014a light sweater or jacket should suffice for this mild evening. The winds, gentle yet refreshing, rustle through the streets, hinting at a night that invites leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or a quiet gathering on a friend\u2019s terrace. The moment is suited for savoring the city\u2019s vibrant pulse while perhaps indulging in a cozy cup of tea at a nearby caf\u00e9, watching as the world transforms from day to twilight.\n\nTomorrow promises mostly sunny warmth, perfect for exploring the city's myriad of nooks and crannies. But tonight, the focus is on enjoying this tranquil interlude where the coolness of the night beckons you to reflect and wander.",
