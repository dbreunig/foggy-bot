    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a cool breeze hints at the approaching night, shrouding the city in a slightly mysterious veil. The forecast whispers of a slight chance of drizzle as the clock ticks towards eleven. The clouds above are a mass of gray, diffuse yet heavy with the potential for light precipitation, while the temperature wraps around you like a gentle embrace, hovering around fifty-seven degrees. The winds, playful in their nature, sweep in from the west southwest, gusting briskly, inviting thoughts of warm layers nestled snugly against the skin. A shroud of marine layer blankets the coastline, a whisper of fog curling around familiar landmarks, teasing the Golden Gate into obscurity.\n\nTuesday dawns with the promise of slightly brighter skies, though the early morning may still be kissed by the remnants of drizzle. The sun, determined yet modest, aims to peek through the clouds, warming the air to about sixty-six degrees. As the morning unfolds, enjoy the dance of sunlight, gradually warming the pavement that cool evenings have left behind. For the day, a long-sleeved shirt paired with a light jacket should serve well against both the lingering chill and the afternoon sun's brightness. It's an ideal time to wander the more serene spots of the city \u2014 perhaps a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero, where the sound of water softly lapping the pier merges with the unwinding melodies of urban life, allowing you to soak in both the fresh air and the picturesque skyline before the day arrives in full bloom.",
