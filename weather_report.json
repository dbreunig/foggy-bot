    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under the gentle embrace of sunshine, a refreshing change that hints at the day's potential. As the light dances off the surrounding buildings, the air feels crisp yet inviting. The temperature, gracefully hovering around the low sixties, is a reminder that while spring nudges its way in, the city\u2019s famous cool breeze whispers of lingering coastal influences. Visibility is good, with only hints of fog retreating to the fringes of the bay, leaving the iconic Golden Gate Bridge standing proud against the stratosphere, free from the usual veil of mist.\n\nAs we move into the afternoon, expect the warmth to taper slightly, settling into a comfortable state. A light jacket or layered clothing would serve well for those venturing into the outdoors, especially with the southwest wind offering a breezy counterpoint to the sun's gentle warmth. With such a delightful day before you, consider taking a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or exploring the winding streets of the city. Seek a cozy caf\u00e9 for an afternoon respite, or simply find a bench with a view, where you can bask in the interplay of light and shadow as the day slowly drifts toward night, culminating in a mostly clear evening adorned with soft celestial brilliance.",
