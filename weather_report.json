    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the city wears a cloak of muted clouds, hinting at a potential light rain that may fall after 11 PM. With temperatures resting gently around 53 degrees, the air feels crisp, almost delicate, stirred by a soft southwest wind. The chances of rain linger at a modest 20%, suggesting a possibility rather than certainty, much like the city\u2019s iconic fog, which may still find spots along the coast.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, a subtle chance of morning rain drifts in, vague and insistent, with mostly cloudy skies offering a cool embrace. The predicted high of 62 degrees will gradually descend towards late afternoon, inviting layers of comfortable clothing to ward off the chill. As you step outside, perhaps consider a light jacket or a warm scarf, both of which can shield against the dampness lingering in the air. The day might be suited to simple pleasures: a stroll along Embarcadero to enjoy the gentle sway of the bay, an unhurried visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or discovering the evenings\u2019 quiet charm in the streets that glow softly under streetlights. \n\nThis soft tableau promises a day of possibilities amidst the ever-changing San Francisco weather, where each moment invites contemplation, and the light rain, if it arrives, can bring a refreshing twist to an otherwise ordinary Monday.",
