    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the skies begin to clear, giving way to a new day where the low murmur of the city stirs awake under a gentle breeze. Expect a sunny Sunday, with the day starting pleasantly cool at around 50 degrees, nudged just a bit by a southward breeze whispering at 3 mph. The sunshine will soon grace the city, with a high nearing 70, then softening to around 68 as afternoon settles in. Although the early hours suggest clarity with hints of fog still clinging to coastal edges, the prevailing sunlight will soon chase away the remnants of the marine layer.\n\nFor those stepping out today, layers are advisable. A light jacket in the morning may serve well until the sun begins its climb, after which a simple shirt will suffice for warmth. The mild temperature and clear skies present the perfect backdrop for a leisurely stroll along Ocean Beach, perhaps with a rug and a good book in tow, or a visit to the bustling Ferry Building Marketplace for some artisanal samples. Whatever the choice, the day promises an inviting atmosphere\u2014one best enjoyed with a sense of tranquility as the city dances in the sunlight.",
