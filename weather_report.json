    "weather_report": "As the clock softly ticked towards the early moments of Tuesday, the stillness in Downtown San Francisco embraces a low, comforting chill. With temperatures resting around 53 degrees, the city uncurls from its slumber beneath a blanket of mostly clear skies, punctuated by a gentle westerly breeze whispering through the streets. This mild night opens its arms to welcome the sun, promising a day that stirs with potential. \n\nWhen daylight breaks, expect the warm embrace of sunshine to rise, ushering in a delightful high near 66 degrees. This is when the day shines in its full splendor, complemented by a friendly wind that dances through the avenues, perhaps coaxing a few lighthearted clouds along for the ride. Visibility will be pleasantly clear, allowing the shimmering outline of the Golden Gate and the rolling hills to present a picturesque canvas. Fog might linger along the outskirts, hesitant but ever watchful, hinting at its usual playful interactions with the bay.\n\nA day like this calls for modest layers: think light jackets that can be easily shed as the sun takes its claim in the sky. Comfortable shoes beckon for leisurely strolls\u2014consider a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 or a gentle walk along the Embarcadero, where the rhythm of the waves provides a calming backdrop for the day. Embrace the opportunity for a quiet morning, perhaps with a book in hand, as the city stirs to life, offering a quiet joy that is uniquely San Francisco.",
