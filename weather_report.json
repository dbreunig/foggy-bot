A light southwest wind whispers through the streets, bringing a hint of cooler air from the Bay, but nothing too bracing. The atmosphere feels serene, inviting strolls down the waterfront or quiet evenings on patios where the soft glow of lanterns flickers against the dimming light.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the forecast reveals a promise of sun-soaked warmth, with the day reaching highs near 74 degrees. The gentle caress of a southwest breeze will persist, occasionally stirring the air, making it feel ever so refreshing against the sun's embrace. There may be moments when the marine layer tries to creep in from the coast, but it will likely leave the day painted in vibrant hues of blue. As you venture out, layers will serve you well\u2014think light jackets for the cooler morning and evening, giving way to shirts that embrace the warmth of the sun once midday arrives. Perhaps while out, one might meander through the bustling farmers' market, pausing to sample local treats or to find a cozy caf\u00e9 where you can savor a cup of coffee while soaking in the atmosphere of a city that pulses with life.",
