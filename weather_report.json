    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a warm and inviting sun, casting a golden light over the iconic skyline. With the temperature gently nestling around 67 degrees, the day feels pleasantly mild, even as a soft west wind rustles through the trees, adding a refreshing edge to the warmth. The visibility is strikingly clear, showcasing the city\u2019s notable landmarks, deftly countering the typical coastal fog that often weaves its way through this vibrant metropolis. There is a hint of marine influence lingering at the edges, but it does not intrude upon today\u2019s brilliance\u2014an occasional whisper of clouds may grace the horizon, yet the atmosphere remains largely bright, inviting those to step outside.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the temperature will gently drop to around 58 degrees, and a partly cloudy sky will emerge, making for a serene evening. Dressing in layers would be wise; a light sweater could provide comfort as the sun wanes, while still allowing for ease during the day. With such delightful weather and a leisurely weekend vibe, a stroll through Golden Gate Park or a relaxed caf\u00e9 visit in the Mission could tempt many. Or perhaps one might simply savor the moment with a book at a sun-drenched spot, taking in the rare clarity and charm that defines San Francisco today.",
