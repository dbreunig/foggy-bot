    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a gentle chill, with the sky mostly cloaked in a gauzy veil of clouds. The muted glamour of the city, illuminated only by scattered streetlights, suggests a tranquil yet mysterious atmosphere. The breeze, lightly playful, dances at around ten miles per hour, a reminder of the maritime influence that often graces this iconic locale. \n\nAs dawn breaks on Friday, expect the sun to emerge triumphantly, casting its golden light over the stunning landscape. The forecast hints at a peak of 66 degrees, easing into the lower 60s by afternoon. Wind gusts will add an invigorating sharpness to the day, inviting a sense of vitality as you explore. Visibility should be good, with the fog likely retreating, but watch for hints of marine layer, particularly in the cooler stretches along the coast. Dress in layers\u2014a light sweater paired with a windbreaker would suit the conditions well. Perhaps a leisurely morning stroll through Golden Gate Park or a cafe visit, paired with a warm cup of coffee, would provide the perfect start to the day. Bask in the enchanting simplicity of these quiet moments, as San Francisco awakens anew.",
