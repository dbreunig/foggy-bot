    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, you will find a canvas of mostly sunny skies unfolding, with temperatures gently whispering around 64 degrees before settling back to a comfortable 61. A light west-southwest wind dances at about 10 mph, adding a refreshing touch to the burgeoning warmth of the day. While the skyline may bask in brightness, the graceful embrace of the marine layer still lingers, its gauzy fingers reaching in from the bay, hinting at a gentle coolness that accompanies the patchy clouds overhead.\n\nAs night descends, the charm of the season continues, with partly cloudy skies inviting a low of 51\u2014a soft cocoon for the evening. Dress comfortably in layers; a light jacket will serve you well against the evening chill, especially if you stroll along the waterfront or through one of the city\u2019s myriad parks. With the weather shaping up nicely and the day drawing to a close, consider a leisurely walk to savor the sunset, perhaps meandering through a local market or stopping at a cozy caf\u00e9, where warm light spills onto the sidewalk, inviting you to linger a little longer in this lovely city.",
