    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a blend of lingering clouds and scattered promises of rain. A cool breeze whistles through the streets, nudging temperatures downward from their peak, which will hover around 54 degrees. The scent of moisture fills the air as darkened clouds drift overhead, hinting at the rain that could fall at any moment. Gusty winds, ranging from brisk to invigorating, will beckon you to grab something warmer before stepping outside. A 50% chance of rain accompanies these clouds, with the possibility of a light shower lingering through the morning hours.\n\nAs the day continues, the sun may make brief appearances, casting a soft glow against the backdrop of the rugged hills and the glistening bay. With a low temperature settling around 47 tonight, it's wise to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater under a light jacket, perfect for the cool evening ahead. Those willing to embrace the weather might find pleasure in a stroll through Golden Gate Park or a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9, where the warm atmosphere counteracts the chilled air outside. With a little bit of preparation, today holds the potential for quiet adventures amidst the shifting skies\u2014an invitation to draw in the inner warmth, no matter how the weather dances above.",
