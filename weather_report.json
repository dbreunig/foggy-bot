    "weather_report": "As the early hours of dawn embrace Downtown San Francisco, a gentle drizzle dances upon the streets, a whisper of moisture that mingles seamlessly with the hazy cloud cover hanging low in the air. The temperature hovers around a cool 54 degrees, complemented by a soft breeze that brushes through the city at a modest nine miles per hour. This quiet morning carries the promise of a more lively afternoon, where the clouds may part slightly, allowing the sun to peek through and warm the city briefly before temperatures drift down to about 63.\n\nThe day ahead calls for layers; a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the chill of the morning and early afternoon. Perhaps a stroll down to the waterfront would be a delightful way to enjoy the afternoon, where the colorful boats bob gently in the harbor, echoing the playful spirit of the city. Alternatively, a quaint caf\u00e9 awaits, offering warmth and comfort in the form of a steaming cup of coffee, perfect for watching the world as it stirs to life. Though the fog may cloak the Golden Gate Bridge for now, the charm of the city still remains palpable, inviting explorers and locals alike to experience its quiet beauty.",
