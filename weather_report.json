    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco begins shrouded in a thick blanket of clouds, whispering promises of rain. Already, the air carries the scent of impending showers, a prelude to the thunderstorms forecasted for the early hours. As the city lies under a sky draped in grey, hints of past sunshine struggle to break through, yet the atmosphere remains heavy and damp. The winds from the west southwest, playful yet assertive, will soon turn cooler as the day matures.\n\nAs the sun ventures higher, expect the storms to gradually recede, unveiling a glimmer of light to greet the afternoon. The day may brighten modestly, reaching a high, but not without reminders of the chill\u2014a breeze that brushes against your skin, urging you to don a light jacket or sweater, perhaps layered over a long-sleeve shirt for added warmth during those moments when shadows creep along the streets and sidewalks. With rain still a likely companion, it\u2019s prudent to carry an umbrella and stroll through the city\u2019s quaint lanes, pausing to sip on some hot coffee or tea, or perhaps enjoy the quiet solace of a local caf\u00e9. The unfolding hours promise more than just precipitation; they invite reflection, a chance to savor the beauty that exists even in the hustle of stormy days.",
