    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, a thick blanket of clouds lingers above, wrapping the city in a muted embrace. The high temperature hovers near a cool 61 degrees, gradually yielding to a slightly chillier 57 as the day wanes. The west-southwest wind whispers through the streets, gentle yet persistent, offering a subtle reminder of the coastal influence that shapes this vibrant locale. While the city needs only to look to its immediate surroundings to catch sight of the looming marine layer, it arrives with an air of mystery that softens the skyline, leaving the Golden Gate Bridge partially obscured and ethereal.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds will continue to cloak the city, drifting softly across the sky. A low of around 48 degrees is expected, transitioning to a slightly warmer 50 overnight. It\u2019s a time for layers; a light jacket or sweater will provide comfort against the chill that settles in as darkness envelops the streets. As you contemplate your afternoon, consider meandering through one of the local cafes, savoring a warm beverage while watching the world pass quietly by. Alternatively, an early evening stroll along the Embarcadero, framed by the soft glow of lights reflecting on the water, invites a moment of connection with the pulse of the city, even in its clouded serenity.",
