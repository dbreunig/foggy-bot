    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a mostly sunny day unfolds, marked by a calm west-southwest breeze. The air is cool yet inviting, with temperatures hovering in the low 60s, gradually easing toward a gentle 62 this afternoon. The city awakens to a clarity that hints at ephemeral beauty, with just the slightest whisper of fog lingering in the shadows, a reminder of the ocean's proximity. \n\nAs twilight approaches, clouds will begin to weave their way across the sky, cloaking the sun with an alluring mystery, and for those taking their evening strolls, the chance of a drizzle emerges, a mere 20 percent. Ideally, a light sweater or a jacket would serve well against the mild chill of the evening, while during the day, layering remains prudent. Today's conditions offer a perfect backdrop for leisurely pursuits\u2014perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm beverage, or a stroll along the waterfront to appreciate the shimmering Bay, capturing its allure as the sun dips towards the horizon.",
