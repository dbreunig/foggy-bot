    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the skies hold a modest charm, partly cloaked with clouds that whisper of warmth in the evening air. As the temperature settles around a comfortable 56 degrees, a gentle breeze drifts in from the west-southwest, stirring the night with familiar gusts. The wind, not too harsh yet playful, dances at speeds between 13 to 21 miles per hour, occasionally teasing with gusts that reach up to 26 miles per hour. Nestled within this temperate embrace, one might find a light jacket or sweater to be a wise companion, perfect for an evening stroll along the waterfront or a quiet chat with friends at a cozy caf\u00e9.\n\nAs dawn approaches tomorrow, the promise of a sunny Saturday unfolds, with peak temperatures flirting with 67 degrees before softening into a delightful 65 by the afternoon. The skies will clear, revealing the cityscape in all its glory, with a brightness that encourages openness yet is complemented by the familiar coastal wind. With breezes expected to pick up, gusting as high as 30 miles per hour, it might be best to secure your hat and embrace light layers; a t-shirt paired with a long-sleeve shirt should do splendidly for the day\u2019s activities. A leisurely bike ride through Golden Gate Park or a visit to a local market would suit the day beautifully, allowing one to savor both the vibrant atmosphere and the invigorating air.",
