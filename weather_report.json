It\u2019s a fine time for a light jacket or a cozy sweater, perhaps to enjoy a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or to explore the neighborhood cafes that come alive with the scent of brewing coffee and freshly baked pastries. As the day winds down, the charm of the city invites you to savor the little moments\u2014sit on a park bench to watch the sky change hues, or find solace in a quiet bookstore, letting the warmth of the sun linger just a little longer.",
