    "weather_report": "As the night drapes over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of clarity prevails, allowing only the softest whispers of cool air through the stillness, with temperatures resting at a gentle 46. A north wind stirs lightly, almost as if it is caressing the city\u2019s contours. The dark sky above holds the promise of a tranquil morning, where tomorrow\u2019s sun will rise to reveal the city\u2019s beauty in full measure. \n\nAs dawn breaks, expect an embrace of sunshine, warming the day to around 54 degrees, fostering a retreat from the chill that lingers in the early hours. Clouds play a shy role, allowing the sun to take center stage briefly before afternoon temperatures recede slightly to around 51. The north wind carries with it a crisp touch, suggesting that a sweater or light jacket would offer comfort for those navigating the streets. Engaging in a leisurely stroll along the piers or perhaps enjoying coffee in one of the city\u2019s many sidewalk cafes could be a lovely way to savor this mellow day. As the haze of any marine layer retreats, the streets invite exploration, unmarred by fog, offering a splendid backdrop for a simple yet satisfying day.",
