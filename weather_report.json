Today\u2019s high reaches a comfortable 69 degrees, a soothing contrast to the lively breeze that dances around at 21 mph, occasionally gusting to 25. As the sun continues to dip in the sky, temperatures will gently cascade to 66, offering a delightful invitation to step outside, inhale the vibrant energy of the city, and forge connections with the cool, invigorating atmosphere that has become a hallmark of this coastal gem. The idea of fog retreating holds promise; while it may linger around the fringes, the main thoroughfares remain clear, allowing the iconic vistas of the Golden Gate to shine through unobscured.\n\nAs evening descends, expect a blanket of mostly cloudy skies that will snugly envelop the city, with temperatures settling around 56 degrees. The wind will soften but still lend a refreshing edge as it whispers through the alleys and avenues, reminding residents of the beauty found in the interplay of sun and cloud. Attire for today should strike a balance: layers come highly recommended, allowing for a light jacket or sweater should the shadows stretch long and the air chill. Venture to the waterfront or through Golden Gate Park\u2014both offer serene walks welcoming late-day reflections and quiet conversations. Alternatively, find a quaint caf\u00e9 to enjoy a warm drink as day relinquishes itself to twilight, embracing the gentle charm of the San Francisco evening.",
