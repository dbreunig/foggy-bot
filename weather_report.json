    "weather_report": "As the city drifts through the early morning hours, a gentle veil of clouds lingers overhead, a soft invitation to the night\u2019s end. Currently, temperatures hover just above a cool 50, a whisper of spring that feels both refreshing and brisk. Shadows wrap around the edges of the skyline, softly obscuring the more distant structures yet allowing the nearby hills to stand resolute. Tomorrow promises a transition as daylight breaks through these lingering clouds, expecting mostly sunny skies with the temperature edging toward a comfortable 61. The west winds murmur at a leisurely pace, encouraging those by the coast to breathe in the salt-kissed air.\n\nIn these moments before dawn, the familiar San Francisco fog remains just a breath away, reminding us of the city\u2019s whimsical dance with the marine layer. While the day may ignite brightly, an extra layer could serve you well, particularly as you venture towards the water or make your way through the city\u2019s charming hills. With the promise of sunshine ahead, perhaps a casual stroll along Crissy Field or a quiet morning spent exploring the art of a local caf\u00e9 could provide just the right mix of inspiration and relaxation for a Saturday awakening.",
