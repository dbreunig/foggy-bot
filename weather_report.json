    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a bright, sunny sky, marked by a crisp breeze that stirs the air with refreshing vigor. The temperature lingers around a pleasant 63 degrees, while hints of a marine layer make their presence known further afield, particularly near the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. As the sun arcs progressively toward the horizon, the cityscape remains clear, transforming its vibrant colors into sharper reliefs against the azure backdrop. Still, the winds whip through the streets at a spirited pace, adding an exhilarating chill that may catch the unprepared.\n\nTonight, expect the skies to don a more muted palette, as partly cloudy conditions settle in with a low around 52 degrees. A similar wind continues its playful dance through the evening, maintaining a brisk atmosphere perfect for a casual stroll along the waterfront or an evening at a local caf\u00e9, where the aromas of freshly brewed coffee intertwine with the cool air. Dress in layers to enjoy the transition from day to night, perhaps opting for a light jacket to fend off the coolness that accompanies twilight. Under these pleasurable conditions, take advantage of the evening by exploring the quieter nooks of the city or indulging in a leisurely meal al fresco, savoring the beauty and rhythm of San Francisco on a tranquil evening.",
