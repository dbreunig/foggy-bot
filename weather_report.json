    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the city exudes a gentle calm, illuminated by the fading light. The forecast promises a partly cloudy night, with temperatures dipping to a modest 48 degrees. A light west wind whispers through the streets, creating a soothing symphony of rustling leaves and distant urban hum. The presence of fog is delicate, lingering only in the gaps between the hills, while the bridge stands resilient against the backdrop of soft clouds, hinting at a shrouded majesty beyond.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will emerge, greeting the day with warmth and clarity, reaching a comfortable high near 64. With a canvas of blue sky, the weather invites you outdoors, perhaps to explore one of the city\u2019s quieter parks or to stroll along the Embarcadero, enjoying the fresh ocean breeze. As for attire, a light jacket will serve well for the evening chill, while a sunnier outfit beckons for tomorrow\u2014think layers, adaptable for warm sunlight and crisp air. Allow yourself to wander, to discover the beauty hidden amidst the familiar streets, or perhaps to indulge in a leisurely coffee at a neighborhood caf\u00e9 as you watch the world pass by.",
