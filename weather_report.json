    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, a cool and mostly cloudy evening settles over the city, with temperatures dipping softly around 54 degrees. The west-southwest winds rustle through the streets, gusting at times, lending an energy to the brisk air that invites both contemplation and movement. Shadows lengthen, and as night deepens, the city is cloaked in a subtle gray softness, the kind that encourages a cozy gathering with friends, perhaps over a steaming mug of something warm.\n\nAs we shift into Sunday, the promise of a mostly sunny day unfolds, heralding welcome warmth with highs nudging the comfortable mid-60s. The day will begin bright, inviting wanderers to embrace outdoor pursuits, but as afternoon rolls in, expect temperatures to pull back slightly. Dress in layers to navigate the dance of warmth and coolness, perhaps donning a light jacket as gusty winds continue to sweep through, playfully tousling hair and scarves alike. An outing to the local farmers' market or a leisurely stroll along the waterfront could be just the ticket, rejuvenating the spirit under the brightening sky as it weaves through the iconic landmarks of this vibrant city.",
