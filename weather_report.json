    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sun bathes the city in a bright, clear light, revealing the iconic skyline and inviting wanderers to embrace the outdoors. Temperatures hover in the low 60s, dipping to a cooler 60 later as a gentle west wind whispers through the streets, at times invigorated by gusts that tumble through alleyways. While the afternoon may seem temperate, a subtle touch of crispness lingers in the air, suggesting that those venturing out might want to don a light jacket, especially as twilight approaches.\n\nAs the evening sets in, the clouds will gather in a partly draped embrace, but not quite a cover, allowing the fading daylight to dance through. As the low slips to around 51, the air will remain fresh, prompting leisurely strolls through neighborhoods or the enjoyment of quiet cafes, where the warmth of a favorite hot drink could add a cozy touch to the unwinding day. The marine layer looms just beyond, suggesting a distant playfulness across the bay but sparing the city from any thick fog that might usually veil its structures. Overall, it is a pleasantly vibrant day, perfect for enjoying the simple act of wandering or savoring the golden hour glow as the city prepares to settle into the night.",
