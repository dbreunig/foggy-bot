    "weather_report": "As the quiet embrace of the night lingers over Downtown San Francisco, clouds drift lazily across the sky, wrapping the city in a soft, muted cloak. The air is mild, resting at around 57 degrees, inviting a light sweater or jacket for those who venture outside. The wind picks up gently from the west-southwest, carrying whispers of the ocean\u2019s breath and shaking the trees with playful gusts.\n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, a promise of warmth surfaces. The day is expected to offer a canvas painted in shades of partly sunny with a high near 66, though one should expect a gentle coolness settling in by the afternoon. The wind will swing again, this time more boisterous, calling for light layers that can be adjusted as the temperature dances throughout the day. \n\nAs the morning unfolds, the city will likely see the marine layer dissipate, leaving behind a crisp clarity perfect for a quiet stroll around the waterfront. Savoring a simple morning coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 or wandering through local parks make for splendid options against this atmospheric backdrop. The breezy conditions may prompt thoughts of kite-flying at Crissy Field, where the sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge over the glimmering bay can inspire a sense of freedom. At day\u2019s end, as the golden hues of sunset wash over the city, a cozy restaurant beckons those seeking warmth, allowing the flavors of local seafood to mingle with the salty air.",
