    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun casts its warm glow over Downtown San Francisco, the skies are an inviting blue, a perfect backdrop for outdoor endeavors. With temperatures hovering comfortably in the low 70s and a gentle breeze blowing in from the west, the day feels refreshingly pleasant. The winds, though spirited, dance rather than disrupt, softly rustling leaves and stirring up the air just enough to remind you of the ocean's embrace, which remains just a heartbeat away. Tonight promises to transition into a cooler evening, with a soft blanket of clouds beginning to weave themselves into the tapestry of the sky, hinting at a mellow ambiance as you wind down.\n\nEven with the clear vistas, there's a subtle suggestion of the marine fog lurking just beyond the horizon, a reminder of the city\u2019s relationship with the ocean. For those stepping out, lightweight layers are the perfect companions for the transition from day to evening; a light sweater or jacket may serve well when the sun begins to dip, complementing a casual stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9. This serene weather beckons exploration, so consider wandering through the vibrant streets or taking a leisurely walk to one of the city's many parks, where you can savor the day\u2019s delights and soak in the beauty around you.",
