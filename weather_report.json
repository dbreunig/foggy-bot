    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a crisp clarity, the sun casting a warm, golden hue over the city. With temperatures hovering around a pleasant 71 degrees, a gentle west wind dances through the streets, bringing a refreshing breath of air that rustles leaves and playfully tugs at loose clothing. As the sun begins its slow descent, the warmth lingers, inviting people to stroll through parks or gather at outdoor caf\u00e9s, where conversations blend with the hum of distant traffic.\n\nAs twilight deepens, a slight chill will seep into the air with the arrival of a night punctuated by stars and the potential for a whisper of drizzle later, a mere 20% chance that seems almost too shy to materialize. It\u2019s a time to wear layers; a light sweater or jacket would offer comfort against the cooling breeze while allowing one to enjoy the serenity of the evening. The horizon glows softly, hinting at the city\u2019s nighttime allure. Whether exploring the vibrant nightlife, savoring a quiet meal, or simply taking a moment to reflect in the lingering light, tonight holds the promise of subdued magic against a backdrop of twinkling lights and endless possibilities.",
