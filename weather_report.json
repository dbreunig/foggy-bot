    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the city wears a cloak of calm, with the horizon a canvas of partly cloudy skies that reveal glimpses of the stars. With the temperature dipping to a cool but tolerable 48 degrees, a gentle breeze stirs from the west southwest, bringing a slight chill that speaks of the impending night. Tonight feels inviting yet layered; a light jacket will serve you well, perhaps paired with a soft scarf to wrap around your neck, as you meander the lingering streets.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the sun promises a fair greeting, with a bright and sunny disposition anticipated throughout the day. Expect the warmth to rise to around 60 degrees, though this will decrease as afternoon approaches. The wind will continue to whisper, though with less intensity than tonight, creating an atmosphere well-suited for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet caf\u00e9 visit to savor a warm drink. Whether you choose to explore the artsy corners of the Mission or gaze over the bay, tomorrow's clarity will uplift spirits, making even the mundane feel extraordinary.",
