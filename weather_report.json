    "weather_report": "As the city sleeps tonight, a gentle cloud covers the horizon, casting a soft blanket over the streets of Downtown San Francisco. The temperature hovers around a mild fifty-two degrees, as a brisk west-southwest wind whispers through the alleyways, carrying the charm of the bay with gusts that dance playfully at times. The clarity of the skies is limited, but not lost\u2014there are echoes of the famed fog that has taken its nocturnal slumber, perhaps hinting at its potential return by morning.\n\nAwakening will likely greet the day with a promise of sunshine piercing through the clouds, as daylight beckons a pleasant, albeit cool, high near sixty-one. The wind will continue its ballet, likely invigorating those who venture out into the morning light. As for how to dress, layering will be the key; a light sweater or jacket will suit the cooler moments while allowing a t-shirt to breathe through the warmth of the sun once it fully emerges. A stroll along the Embarcadero might just prove delightful, or perhaps a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 to savor a warm cup of coffee as you watch the city wake slowly around you. There\u2019s a quiet beauty in this blend of fog and sun, a reminder of the city's character\u2014a canvas ever-shifting, yet always familiar.",
