    "weather_report": "As the dawn light breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere holds a soft, muted charm \u2014 mostly cloudy skies blanket the city, wrapping it in a gentle, gray embrace. The overnight chill lingers, hovering around a comfortable 57 degrees, complemented by a brisk west-southwest breeze that whispers through the streets. Today promises a shift toward clarity, with a gradual lifting of clouds, allowing the sun to peek through intermittently. By midday, expect temperatures to flirt with the mid-60s before settling into a cool, inviting warmth as the afternoon unfolds.\n\nAlthough the fog is not as thick as sometimes experienced, hints of the marine layer hang around the coastal regions, subtly softening the outlines of landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge. The winds, from a mild 9 to 22 mph, carry a refreshing energy, ideal for a midday stroll or a relaxed cafe outing. Dress in layers; a light sweater will serve you well against the coolness of the morning, while a short-sleeve shirt or a light jacket will suffice as the sun begins to liberate its warmth. With such pleasant weather, consider wandering through the city, exploring local art galleries or discovering a quaint bookshop nestled in the hills. Enjoy the simple, serene moments that only a San Francisco day can offer, where every corner is an invitation to embrace both the familiar and the new.",
