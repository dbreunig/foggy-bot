    "weather_report": "In the early hours of a San Francisco morning, a delicate shroud of clouds blankets the city, teetering on the edge of a fleeting rainfall. The air drapes itself around you with a crispness that speaks of a chill lingering before dawn truly breaks. As the sun prepares its ascent, a gentle breeze whispers through the streets, promising a gradual clearing. Yet, the forecast hints at a chance of rain before midday, suggesting an unpredictable companionship of sunshine and moisture may linger through the morning.\n\nThe day ahead unfurls with a tentative promise: mostly sunny skies emerging from the clouds by afternoon, though the heaviness of fog still clings to the edges of the bay. If you're stepping outside, layer yourself in the comfort of warm clothing, perhaps a light jacket to protect against the brisk wind that rustles through the city. A stroll through the streets could lead you to enjoy a warm beverage in one of the local caf\u00e9s or perhaps a visit to an art gallery, where the growing light will enhance the colors of creatures and creations alike, infusing a sense of life into every brushstroke. The pervasive beauty of this morning invites you to explore the softer hues of San Francisco before the full vibrancy of the day ignites.",
