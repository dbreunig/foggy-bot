    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sun casts a gentle light, bringing warmth that teeters around a cool 60 degrees. The sky is mostly clear, though there are hints of clouds that dance on the horizon, as a brisk west wind carries a refreshing chill. While the air lacks the heavy embrace of fog, a light marine layer may linger in the distance, merely suggesting the presence of the ocean without intruding upon the vibrant city atmosphere. The prevailing winds whisper of an exhilarating day, inviting a stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a leisurely bike ride across the Golden Gate, where the views stretch wide, revealing the beauty that resides within the bay.\n\nAs night falls, the clouds will thicken, wrapping the city in a slightly cooler embrace with temperatures dipping to around 51 degrees. The chance of precipitation remains modest, just enough to keep thoughts of an unexpected sprinkle at bay. As twilight approaches, a light jacket will serve you well, especially with the wind nipping at exposed skin. There\u2019s no rush this evening; consider winding down at a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of warm beverages fills the air, or perhaps find comfort in the local shops that beckon with their intriguing displays. Today allows for both exploration and tranquility, a reminder that moments of simple joy often provide the best memories.",
