    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle layer of cloud blankets the city, weaving a soft veil against the early light. The air carries a cool whisper, with temperatures hovering around 52, setting a serene tone for the day ahead. Looking towards the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, the fog mingles with the clouds, creating a mystique that San Francisco wears so well. As the sun climbs, expect a modest reprieve from the chill, drawing temperatures up to a high of around 61. Yet, the afternoon will weave temperatures down again to about 57, as if the city breathes in and out, shifting its ambience between coolness and warmth.\n\nDressed in layers, one can embrace the playful ballet of the bay's coastal air, allowing for easy adjustments between the cooler morning and the mellow afternoon warmth. A light jacket paired with a comfortable scarf is recommended, perfect for a leisurely stroll through one of the city\u2019s charming neighborhoods or perhaps a quiet coffee at a favorite caf\u00e9. The looming clouds imply an inviting tranquility, ideal for a more introspective day\u2014perhaps a visit to an art gallery or a cozy bookshop, where the lingering fog acts as a gentle incitement to slow down and reflect.",
