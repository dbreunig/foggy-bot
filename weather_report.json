    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a tranquil blanket of mostly cloudy skies cradles the city, with temperatures gently tapering towards a low of around 50. The west winds whisper softly at 10 to 15 mph, occasionally stirring up the air with playful gusts, adding a brisk chill that encourages you to wrap yourself in a cozy layer. The lingering marine layer hints at a touch of fog, though the city remains mostly clear, allowing for silhouettes of iconic landmarks to pierce through the gathering dusk.\n\nTomorrow heralds the arrival of a partly sunny day, though you might notice warmth evanescing by afternoon, as the sun dips toward a high of 58, only to retreat to a cooler embrace. For those venturing out, a medium-weight jacket paired with a soft scarf will provide the perfect antidote against the brisk gusts and damp air. This is an excellent opportunity for a leisurely stroll through one of the city's many parks, perhaps enjoying a quiet moment on a bench or visiting a local caf\u00e9 to sip a warm drink in good company, perfect for these serene, Sunday-like evening vibes amidst the urban buzz.",
