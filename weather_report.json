    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unveils a beautiful expanse of blue sky adorned with soft wisps of white clouds. The sunlight filters gently through, casting a warm glow on the city. Today's weather is sunny, with a high nearing 64 degrees, though it'll gradually cool to around 62 as the afternoon progresses. A mild southwest breeze dances lightly through the streets, adding a gentle rustle to the air, making it a pleasant day to step outside.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the promise of warmth lingers, though the increasingly visible marine layer hints at the evening's approach, bringing with it a slight chill that beckons a light jacket or sweater. Despite the sun's presence, the lingering touch of coolness may encourage a leisurely stroll around the local park or a visit to a lakeside caf\u00e9. Take a moment to enjoy the serene vibe of the city, perhaps savoring a coffee while watching the world go by, as the day yields to the tranquility of night and partly cloudy skies envelop the horizon.",
