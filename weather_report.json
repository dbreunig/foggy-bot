    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle sun bathes the streets, entwined with a brisk wind that whispers tales of the ocean and the surrounding hills. Currently hovering around a peaceful 58 degrees, the air is fresh, invigorating, yet occasionally stirred by gusts that remind you\u2014this is no ordinary sunny day. The vivid outline of the Golden Gate stands sentinel, partially framed by the wisps of marine layer reluctantly retreating, letting the city unfurl its storied silhouette under the slanted rays.\n\nAs evening approaches, the atmosphere promises a quiet clarity. Temperatures will find solace at around 49 degrees, accompanied by a mellow wind that carries the salt of the sea and the fragrant notes of blossoms awakening this time of year. Dressing in layers would be wise\u2014a light jacket or a cozy cardigan can shield against the occasional cool breath, while a comfortable pair of shoes invites you to roam and explore. With the day still alive with possibility, take to the waterfront to watch the sun set over the Bay, or perhaps wander the local shops, where the energy of the day lingers, and the promise of an evening indulgence beckons from artisan caf\u00e9s and bistros nearby.",
