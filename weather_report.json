    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a refreshing coolness, just shy of 52 degrees, a gentle reminder that even in late spring, the city maintains its maritime charm. The west wind whispers softly at about 7 mph, hinting at a clearer day ahead as the sun ascends. Soon, the sun will illuminate the skyline, promising a pleasant temperature that should peak around 68 degrees later in the day, a welcome opportunity for outdoor pursuits.\n\nFor now, the city is wrapped in a delicate veil of clouds, remnants of the coastal fog that frequently adores the Golden Gate. Although it's not entirely absent, the haze appears to be retreating, making way for bright blue skies that invite exploration. With the forecast of a sunny afternoon, it would be wise to don layers\u2014a light sweater or jacket in the morning, easily shed as the warmth of the sun takes over. A stroll along the waterfront, perhaps a quieter moment in one of the cozy cafes or bookstores, will surely highlight the allure of this day. As the morning transforms into afternoon, the city beckons, urging all to embrace the beauty of its imperfect perfection.",
