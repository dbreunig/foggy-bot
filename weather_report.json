    "weather_report": "As we drift into the morning hours, the realms of Downtown San Francisco greet the day with a soft embrace of clarity. Shadows cast by the Ornate architecture emerge gracefully, while the coolness of the night hangs in the air, hinting at a breezy awakening. Right now, the temperature rests near a refreshing 47 degrees, a gentle tease of what the day has in store. Fleeting patches of cloud drift among the skies, suggesting a playful dance of sunlight that promises a mostly bright tableau by mid-morning.\n\nAs Friday unfolds, we anticipate the sun to fully claim its throne, reveling in highs that flirt with 60 degrees before a gradual descent into the afternoon. The whispers of the west-northwest wind will be a mild companion, caressing the city streets and renewing the landscape with whispers of tranquility. There is indeed a chance of the marine layer gently kissing the edges of the Golden Gate, but for most, the horizon is a canvas brushed with soft, inviting hues. On this fine day, a light jacket or a cozy sweater will be your faithful ally, perfect for those leisurely strolls along the waterfront or idling moments spent in one of the charming cafes lining the streets. Why not meander through the vibrant Mission District, letting the eclectic murals inspire your thoughts, or perhaps find a quiet park to enjoy a book and sip on a warm drink? The world is alive with possibility, and the beauty of San Francisco awaits.",
