    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, a soft layer of clouds blankets the skyline, casting the city in a gentle gray hue. The air whispers of the mild maritime influence, hinting at the slight possibility of drizzle that could accompany the night. A west-southwest wind rustles through the streets, carrying the scent of the ocean, and a cool balm settles in as temperatures drift toward the low sixties. The chance of precipitation is low, a mere whisper at 20%, yet the city\u2019s character remains undeniably wrapped in a light-hearted veil of uncertainty.\n\nLooking to tomorrow, the sun promises to peek through the clouds early in the day, teasing a more vibrant afternoon on the horizon. With temperatures reaching into the upper sixties and a refreshing breeze picking up, it suggests an opportunity for a light jaunt along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s parks. Attire best suited for this shifting weather includes layered garments, perhaps a light jacket or a cozy sweater for the morning, giving way to comfort as the sun warms the day. Whether indulging in a casual stroll, embracing the last remnants of summer at a caf\u00e9 terrace, or simply savoring a book amidst the changing sky, this evening offers a serene backdrop to the ever-evolving tapestry of city life.",
