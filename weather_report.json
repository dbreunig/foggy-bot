    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon is unfolding with a gentle radiance that bathes the city in a pleasant warmth. The skies are a serene canvas painted in rich blue hues, suggesting a day devoid of the typical fog that often cloaks the Golden Gate. Wind whispers through the streets, a companionable breeze blowing from the west-southwest at a brisk pace, keeping both the temperature and spirits uplifted. As the sun slides toward the horizon, temperatures may dip slightly but remain comfortably mild, inviting a leisurely stroll or a spontaneous visit to a local caf\u00e9.\n\nTonight, skies will transition to a picturesque tapestry of partly cloudy formations, with a still whisper of wind gliding through the evening air. As dusk descends upon the city, those venturing out would do well to don light layers, perhaps a soft jacket to fend off the cooler tones of the evening. Given the inviting conditions, an impromptu gathering with friends at a rooftop bar or a tranquil walk along Embarcadero promises to yield a moment of calm amidst the bustle of city life, with glimpses of silvery waters reflecting the last glimmers of daylight.",
