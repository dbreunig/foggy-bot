    "weather_report": "In the early hours of the morning, the skies over Downtown San Francisco are a tranquil tapestry of mostly clear conditions, with a gentle breeze whispering through the streets at around six miles per hour. As the sun rises, it promises a bright and sunny day, eventually reaching a high near 67 degrees before settling into a comfortable 65 by afternoon. There\u2019s a certain clarity in the air, hinting at a pleasant warmth as the day unfolds, making this a perfect time to bask in the soft embrace of golden sunlight.\n\nYet, the marine layer occasionally drapes its tendrils over the city, a subtle reminder of the coastal proximity. Fog, while absent this morning, may still linger at the edges as the day progresses, hinting at its potential return come evening. As you venture out, a light jacket may serve well against that characteristic chill, particularly if you plan to wander along the waterfront or find a cozy caf\u00e9 to sip your morning brew. Today invites quiet exploration\u2014perhaps a stroll through the park or a visit to a local bookstore, where the world can slow down amidst the literary treasures.",
