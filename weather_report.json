    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a generous embrace of sunshine, casting a brilliant glow across the landscape. Temperatures hover close to 59 degrees, perhaps dipping a few degrees as the afternoon advances. The west-northwest winds add a brisk energy, rustling through the trees and offering a refreshing caress, while the horizon boasts a clarity that promises an inviting outdoor experience. The absence of a significant marine layer allows the iconic skyline to stand proud against the backdrop of a blue, cloud-dotted sky, hinting at the warmth of the season ahead.\n\nAs evening approaches, the warmth will gradually yield to a coolness, with nighttime temperatures dipping to around 46. The gentle winds will remain, swirling along the streets, inviting those adorned in comfortable layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket, ideal for an evening stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9. With the day winding down, consider taking in the unparalleled beauty of the setting sun casting golden hues upon the bay, a perfect backdrop for quiet reflection or a casual meet-up with friends.",
