    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night offers a gentle embrace of clouds, wrapping the city in a soft layer of quiet warmth, as temperatures linger around 54 degrees. The southwesterly breeze carries whispers of moisture, hinting at the dampness that might come later. As dawn sets in, expect a day that teeters between the sun\u2019s shy glances and the possible arrival of rain by evening. With a high near 62 degrees, the temperature will dip slightly as the afternoon progresses, while winds will dance gently, sometimes gusting to 21 miles per hour. \n\nFor those traversing the streets today, it\u2019s wise to dress in layers; a light jacket over a comfortable shirt will prepare you for the shifting moods of the weather. The city, typically vibrant and alive, may find itself enveloped in a slight veil of fog, especially around the iconic bridges, where the marine layer often lingers. A stroll through the lesser-traveled alleys or a cozy caf\u00e9 visit would suit the day beautifully. As the clouds begin to disperse and the chance of rain looms, one might find joy in a quiet corner of a library or a local bookstore, savoring the words of a novel while the world outside teeters between sun and shadow.",
