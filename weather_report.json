    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a clear, cerulean sky, a pleasant contrast to the typical fog that graces this region. With temperatures hovering near a comfortable 65 degrees, the afternoon promises to smooth out into a gentle tumble toward 61, as the west-southwest breezes dance through the streets, whispering tales of the bay. A few scattered clouds may hang softly, but they do little to interrupt the sun\u2019s warm embrace. \n\nAs evening approaches, expect the clouds to linger in a more playful manner, settling down into a mild night with temperatures slipping to a breezy 52 degrees. This is the kind of day that beckons one to take a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps stopping for an artisanal coffee or a pastry at a corner caf\u00e9, where the aromas blend sweetly with the fresh air. Those venturing out might appreciate a light jacket for later, but the day carries a delightful freshness that invites exploration, be it through the storied streets or along the inviting waterfront. Soft cottons and light layers will serve you well today, as you navigate both sunny spots and the cool breeze that hints at the ocean.",
