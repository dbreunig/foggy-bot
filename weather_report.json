    "weather_report": "As dawn slowly unfurls in Downtown San Francisco, the remnants of night cling to the air, mingling with whispers of a cool, elegant breeze that promises a brighter day ahead. The forecast suggests a transition from the starlit silence of the night, with clouds slowly parting, unveiling a sun that will bathe the city in gentle warmth. Expect a high near 60, though the afternoon will see the temperature quietly retreat to a more modest 57. The soft southwest wind, nudging around ten miles per hour, will stir the hanging aroma of salt from the bay, and perhaps a few stray commercial sails will glint upon the tranquil horizon.\n\nThis morning's clarity is delightful if not entirely unmarred; you might notice the city still draped in a gauzy veil that hints at lingering fog. The marine layer, ever capricious, may shroud the Golden Gate briefly before yielding to the sun's gentle embrace, clearing the vistas just enough for an outing to the waterfront. With a distinct chill settling in not too far from the highlands, dressing in layers will be wise\u2014a light jacket paired with a snug sweater will provide comfort against the crisp morning air while being easily removable as the sun ascends. The symphony of the waking city will invite you to a leisurely stroll through the early farmers' market or perhaps a visit to the waterfront's artisan cafes, where one can sip a warm brew while soaking in the slow unraveling of a new day.",
