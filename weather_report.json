    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the early morning, a soft hush blankets Downtown San Francisco. The night's embrace lingers, marked by a delicate chance of drizzle, adding a gentle sheen to the streets below. With a calm low of around 56, the air carries a crispness, inviting those awakened to venture forth wrapped in light layers, perhaps a cardigan or a lightweight jacket. As the morning progresses, hints of sunlight will begin to break through the clouds, illuminating the iconic skyline while temperatures make a modest ascent to around 63, eventually settling slightly lower in the afternoon.\n\nWhile the fog may not be an overwhelming presence today, the remnants of the marine layer still linger off the coast, casting an ethereal visage over the Golden Gate Bridge. This lends the day an understated beauty, where moments of clarity can shine forth in unexpected ways. One might find solace in a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, enjoying the gentle breeze that whispers of the ocean, or perhaps a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aromas of brewing coffee pair beautifully with the day\u2019s mild charms. Commuters and wanderers alike will find the weather pleasantly temperate, offering an ideal backdrop to simply engage with the rhythm of the city as it unfurls gently towards noon.",
