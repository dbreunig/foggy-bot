    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a chill, hinting at the rain soon to grace the golden streets. The clouds, thick and somber, hang low, shrouding the skyline in a muted embrace. Nightfall is approaching swiftly as temperatures hover in the cool 40s, whispering for a cozy sweater or maybe a lightweight jacket to ward off the biting breeze. \n\nThe horizon ahead suggests the possibility of rain\u201430% chance, a mere uncertainty that teeters between soothing mist and a deliberate downpour, mostly teasing the edges of the day with promise. There is a notable absence of fog at present, however the marine layer lurks nearby, ready to roll inland as the night deepens. Tomorrow may dawn with rain before yielding to patches of sunlight, perhaps allowing the day to unfold into a bright albeit brisk afternoon as temperatures dip further. For now, the atmospheric gloom invites quiet indoor pursuits, maybe a trip to a local caf\u00e9 for a hot cup of coffee, or a leisurely stroll along the bay, taking in the muted beauty of the city amidst the brooding clouds.",
