    "weather_report": "As dawn gently breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the air holds a cool embrace, whispering of the calm before the sun emerges. The night\u2019s clouds linger, softening the horizon, while a gentle wind from the west hints at the warmth waiting just beyond the morning haze. The city, draped in its typical foggy blanket, gives way to a soft glow as the day unfolds. \n\nIn a few hours, the sun will assert its presence, casting warmth into the streets. The high will hover near a comfortable sixty-six degrees, a delightful respite from the chill of the early morning. For those stepping out today, layering will be key; a light jacket or cardigan will feel just right until the sun dances higher and the clouds dissipate. Perhaps this day calls for an ambling walk through the local cafes, or a visit to a bookshop where the pages turn like the mellow afternoon. The diminishing marine layer may obscure the iconic view of the Golden Gate Bridge, but its elusive charm only adds to the day's character, inviting quiet moments of reflection amidst the city\u2019s hustle.",
