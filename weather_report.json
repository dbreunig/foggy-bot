The skies are draped in a muted gray, hinting at the clouds thickening overhead and heralding a low of 49 degrees later tonight\u2014a comfortable chill that calls for layered attire. Those venturing out will find a light west-southwest wind stirring the evening\u2019s atmosphere, while the chance of rain draws closer, suggesting it may be prudent to carry an umbrella, should one choose to stroll through the streets illuminated by scattered lamps.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the chance of rain grows more pronounced, mid-afternoon temperatures hovering near 55 degrees, urging a thoughtful approach to personal comfort. Dressed in something warm yet breathable, one might consider an afternoon at a local caf\u00e9, indulging in a good book as the rhythmic patter of raindrops becomes a soothing backdrop. Visibility may be veiled by a light marine layer, adding a touch of mystique to the iconic Golden Gate, swathed in clouds yet undeterred in its grandeur. As twilight draws near, the scene is set for an evening spent within the communal warmth of friends, perhaps sharing stories and laughter while the city dances quietly outside, inviting, enigmatic, and undeniably alive.",
