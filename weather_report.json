    "weather_report": "As the city sleeps through the night, a gentle veil of clouds drapes over Downtown San Francisco, hinting at fleeting rain before dawn. A soft chill lingers in the air, with whispers of wind that seem to echo the tendrils of fog reaching toward the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. Morning promises a slow awakening, with a chance of clearing as the sun rises and disperses the remnants of the night\u2019s precipitation. As daybreak flourishes, expect a dance of clouds in a mostly sunny sky, where gusts from the west will carry away any lingering moisture, inviting a cool brightness that will keep temperature in the temperate embrace of the mid-fifties.\n\nDressed wisely in layers, one might find comfort in a light jacket against the crisp air while roaming the streets. The slight humidity in the air suggests it\u2019s a perfect time to explore the local caf\u00e9s, perhaps indulging in the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee or the sweet allure of a pastry. A stroll across the Embarcadero could offer tranquil moments beside the bay, where the gentle lap of water against the shoreline feels particularly serene. As the day unfolds and clouds untangle, the city invites its dwellers to savor these hours of exploration, enveloped in the signature charm that only San Francisco can bestow.",
