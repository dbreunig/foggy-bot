    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon greets you with warm sunlight spilling over the iconic skyline, a rare gift from the city's notorious fog. The air is invigorating, a brisk breeze from the west southwest rustling the trees as it carries the distant sounds of the bustling city below. As the sun dips towards the horizon, expect the temperature to settle gently, wrapping you in a comfortable embrace around 66 degrees. The clarity of the sky hints at a high degree of visibility, allowing the Golden Gate Bridge to stand boldly against the backdrop, its majesty unencumbered by the usual shrouds of fog.\n\nCome evening, the skies will mostly remain clear, with the low dipping to a mild 54 degrees. The same breeze that invigorates now whispers softly, creating a serene atmosphere perfect for an evening stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet dinner al fresco. As the daylight wanes, don a light jacket, perfect for the cool air that follows the warmth of the day, and consider indulging in a casual outing to watch the sunset paint the horizon with shades of orange and pink. Perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 could round out the evening, where you might savor a warm drink as twilight blankets the city\u2014a perfect end to a day that began with sun, brushed lightly by the vestiges of fog, and closed with a tranquil promise of another beautiful day ahead.",
