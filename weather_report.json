    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day begins with an elusive hint of sullenness, the early hours marked by a slight chance of drizzle that fades as the sun makes its presence felt. The sunlight filters through the clouds, casting a soft glow on the streets, though shadows hint at the faint chill of the air. With the temperature predicted to hover around a comfortable 64 degrees, transitioning gently to about 61 as the day unfolds, one can expect a refreshing breeze driven by the west-southwest wind, which whips through the city at 12 to 23 mph. This invites a pleasant, yet invigorating, feel, a classic signature of the city that invites both locals and visitors to venture outside, perhaps for a stroll along the Embarcadero or a casual coffee at a favorite caf\u00e9.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will turn slightly more somber, cloaked in the embrace of clouds, with the chance of drizzle reintroducing itself after dark. It would be wise to layer, opting for a light jacket or sweater to ward off the evening chill that settles around 54 degrees. The iconic marine layer may begin to curl around the Golden Gate, offering a glimpse of the romance that comes with fog, perfect for an evening walk, a pause to enjoy the dim glow of streetlights reflecting off the bay, or perhaps to catch a show at a local theater. The weather embodies a bittersweet nature, encapsulating the ethereal charm of San Francisco, ideal for a day that dances between sunlight and mystery.",
