As the afternoon unfolds, temperatures hover near a comfortable 64, drifting softly down to 62, inviting those outside to bask in the mildness that defines this city. A west-southwest wind fingers through the streets at about 15 mph, with gusts occasionally reaching 22 mph, adding a refreshing bite to the air. The cloud cover begins to settle in, casting a soft veil; it\u2019s a night when the low dips to a cozy 57, a fitting end to a day that feels both invigorating and tranquil.\n\nAs the evening approaches, one might find the fog lingering just beyond the hills, a reminder of the marine layer's ever-watchful presence. Dressed in light layers\u2014a comfortable sweater or an airy scarf\u2014would be wise for those venturing out to enjoy a leisurely stroll. The remnants of sunshine might beckon one to a nearby caf\u00e9 terrace, cradled by the vibrant sounds of the city. Alternatively, the quiet charm of a bookshop, paired with a warm drink, offers a peaceful retreat as the clouds gather for the night. The day beckons exploration and simple pleasures, wrapped in the gentle rhythm of urban life, inviting every resident and visitor to partake in its understated beauty.",
