    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sky unfurls in a brilliant display of sunshine, weaving its warm tapestry against the crisp clarity of the day. A gentle west-southwest breeze whispers through the streets, offering a refreshing contrast as temperatures dance around 65 degrees. Although the warmth is palpable, there's a cool undertone \u2014 a harbinger of the evening's approach, which softly beckons in shades of twilight.\n\nAs night falls, expect a steady transition to partly cloudy skies, where the gentle afterglow may serve as a perfect backdrop for evening strolls along the Embarcadero or a casual gathering at a local caf\u00e9. With the temperature dipping to around 55 degrees, a light jacket or sweater will complement the warm tones of the day. Consider taking a leisurely walk through the vibrant Mission District or exploring the hidden gems of North Beach; the lingering warmth of the day will still be lingering with you as the sounds of the city serenade the night.",
