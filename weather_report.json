    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, a gentle tapestry of clouds hugs the skyline, embracing the city with a comfortable embrace. Expect a low of around 60 degrees, accompanied by a soft breeze from the west, whispering through the streets at about 9 mph. This atmospheric touch lends a serene calmness to the evening, as the city prepares for the subtle shift of time.\n\nAs the dawn breaks over the horizon on Thursday, the promise of a partly sunny day unfolds, heralding temperatures near 67. Golden rays will dance through the remnants of the marine layer, revealing patches of blue and inviting a budding warmth into the air. With winds shifting from the west-southwest, reaching gusts up to 21 mph, feather light layers might be your best bet to accommodate the variable conditions. Consider a light sweater or a casual jacket for the morning chill, gradually shedding layers as the sun climbs higher in the sky. With such a day at hand, a leisurely walk along the waterfront or an afternoon spent in one of the city\u2019s vibrant parks might be the perfect antidote to the routine, allowing for both a breath of fresh air and a moment of quiet reflection amid the urban rhythm.",
