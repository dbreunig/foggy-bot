    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a gentle hush settles over the city, cloaking it in the cool embrace of early spring. Tonight, the air holds the promise of rain, with clouds drifting across the starlit expanse, casting a soft shadow on the vibrant skyline. A whisper of wind dances through the streets, carrying with it the scent of ozone and earth, heightening the anticipation for what lies ahead. Those venturing out should dress warmly, perhaps opting for a light jacket or sweater to ward off the evening chill. The chance of rain lingers at about forty percent, suggesting that a light drizzle could grace those who wander.\n\nTomorrow will bring a bit more brightness, as the sun seeks to peek through the mostly cloudy veil. With a higher likelihood of rain later, the high will reach a cool sixty degrees, inviting walks along the waterfront or quiet moments shared over warm cups in cozy caf\u00e9s. The marine layer may touch the edges of the Golden Gate, wrapping it in its misty cloak, while the bustling city remains alive beneath a veil of subdued light. While the weather may not shine brilliantly, it offers a reflective charm that embodies the character of San Francisco, perfect for a stroll at dusk or a meandering through art-filled alleyways, discovering the delicate details that often go unnoticed.",
