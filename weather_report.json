    "weather_report": "As the night unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, the air holds a soft chill, wrapping around the city like a delicate cloak. Partly cloudy skies stretch above, hinting at the possibility of rain with dawn's arrival. The streets, now still, are painted in a muted palette, illuminated by the glow of streetlamps and the flicker of distant lights. Ocean breezes whisper through the city, with gentle gusts hinting at the marine layer not far off, reminding us of the close proximity of the restless sea.\n\nTomorrow promises to be a dance of clouds, with the chance of rain sprightly tiptoeing in after 8 am. A high near 59 will offer a cool embrace, encouraging layered dressing to navigate both warmth indoors and briskness outside. A lightweight jacket or a layered cardigan will serve well against the south wind that will pick up during the day. As rain softly taps on windows and the world beyond becomes a canvas of muted colors, there will be a certain comfort in a cozy caf\u00e9, where one can savor a warm drink while watching the city pulse quietly through the glass.\n\nThe day may demand a mix of spontaneity and calm; why not wander through the fog-kissed paths of Golden Gate Park or explore a hidden bookstore, with the scent of damp pages mingling with the aroma of brewed coffee? Each endeavor will blend well with the atmosphere, capturing the essence of a day brimming with understated charm amidst the changing weather.",
