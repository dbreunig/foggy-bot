    "weather_report": "As the night transitions into dawn, Downtown San Francisco is draped in a cool embrace, the air fresh with a crispness hinting at the tranquility of the night's clear sky. The low temperature settles snugly around 46 degrees, and the gentle north-northeast breeze whispers softly through the streets, averaging a modest 7 mph. Come Thursday, the sun will rise to bathe the city in warmth, urging temperatures to climb to a comfortable high of 62 before settling back to a cooler 59 in the afternoon, accompanied by the same light breeze that will make the air feel all the more pleasant.\n\nWith the forecast promising a sunny day devoid of fog, the horizon will stand sharply defined, offering a perfect backdrop for any number of endeavors. You might find it ideal to don a light jacket in the morning that can easily be shed as the sun warms your skin. Such weather invites leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero, the bright skies reflecting on the water, or perhaps a quiet sit at a local caf\u00e9, where the warmth of your beverage is complemented by the sun pouring golden rays onto the sidewalk. Embrace the opportunity to immerse yourself in the city's vibrant yet laid-back charm, relishing in a day that calls for exploration, connection, and perhaps a hint of adventure in the unpretentious pursuit of enjoying life in this wondrous city.",
