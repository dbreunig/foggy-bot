    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun casts its final rays over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth emerges, offering a promising respite from the traditional coolness of this coastal city. The temperature hovers around a comfortable 62 degrees, with the vibrant clarity of the day slowly shifting towards the signature San Francisco evening chill. A brisk wind carries the scent of the ocean, whipping at 24 miles per hour\u2014invigorating yet urging one to layer up for comfort. \n\nBy nightfall, the skyline will retreat behind a veil of clouds, the low dipping to a mild 54, fragrant with the briny whispers of the bay. One might bundle in a light jacket against the briskness, perhaps slipping into comfortable shoes for an evening stroll along the waterfront. The shimmering city lights reflecting in the rippling waters can soothe the soul as one meanders through the bustling yet serene atmosphere. It's a night for reflective wandering, sharing soft laughs with friends, or browsing the local boutiques that line the streets, each promising a little treasure waiting to be discovered. The lingering marine layer plays coy with visibility, yet that mystique adds charm, offering a taste of the city\u2019s ever-enigmatic spirit.",
