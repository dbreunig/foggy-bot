    "weather_report": "As daylight embraces Downtown San Francisco, a refreshing breeze dances through the streets, brushing past the iconic skyline with an invigorating warmth. The sun spills its golden light over the city, illuminating the upright buildings against a canvas of azure sky. For now, the fog's notorious grip seems absent, promising a day of clarity and joy as it stays confined to the horizons, leaving the vista sprawling and welcoming without a hint of the marine layer\u2019s cool breath. \n\nThis afternoon will hover around a pleasant 63 degrees, ideal for both leisurely strolls and outdoor endeavors. As evening approaches, the temperature will modestly dip, inviting a cozy layer for those venturing out; adding a light jacket or shawl would be a sensible choice to ward off the evening chill. The energetic hustle of the day fuses seamlessly into a congenial atmosphere; whether you're exploring the vibrant streets, indulging in a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, or simply toasting the sunset with friends at a park, today's conditions lend themselves to a perfect interlude in the ever-pulsing heart of the city.",
