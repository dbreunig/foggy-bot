    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere carries a pleasant, laid-back charm as the sun breaks through the lingering clouds. The temperature hovers around a mild 62 degrees, making it an ideal moment to enjoy the urban landscape. A gentle breeze from the west southwest teases the air at about 10 mph, inviting residents and visitors alike to step outdoors and embrace the unfolding day.\n\nAs daylight wanes into night, expect the skies to cloak themselves in a veil of soft clouds, with temperatures dipping to around 50 degrees. The marine layer dances at the edges of the city, but for now, the fog remains at bay, leaving clear views of the iconic skyline. In such conditions, layers are the key: a light sweater or jacket would suffice to ward off the evening chill. As the sun dips lower, consider a leisurely stroll through a local park, or perhaps settle into a cozy corner of a favorite caf\u00e9, watching the urban rhythm pulse around you. The weather invites you to savor the simple pleasures of life in this unique city, neither too warm nor chilly, but just right for a peaceful afternoon's end.",
