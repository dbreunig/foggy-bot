The anticipated warmth settles gently around 64 degrees, but a swift west wind rustles through the streets, creating a refreshing rhythm that hints at the coolness to come. While the famed fog seems to shy away for now, its elusive presence may linger nearby, ultimately yielding to a clear, vibrant blue overhead. \n\nCome evening, the city transitions to a more subdued atmosphere, with clouds lazily drifting in, perhaps whispering reminders of the marine layer's approach. The temperatures will dip to a soft 54, wrapped in the embrace of a west-southwest wind that persists, offering an invigorating bite. Suitable attire may well include layers\u2014a lightweight jacket for the chill and a scarf to soften the brisk air. This evening, as the world slows and shadows stretch, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment in a local caf\u00e9 would perfectly complement the evolving scene, inviting you to savor the city's unique charm as it dances between vibrant clarity and the comforting embrace of twilight.",
