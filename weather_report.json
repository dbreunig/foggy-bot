    "weather_report": "Morning light spills across Downtown San Francisco, brushing past the iconic outlines of the city. Today greets us with promises of sunshine, although the high of about 65 may see a gentle decline as afternoon whispers sneak in through the towering buildings. The west-southwest wind, robust at 13 to 24 mph with gusts up to 30, adds a refreshing twist to the encounter. As you step outside, you might sense a slight chill, a reminder of the ocean's proximity, lingering like soft fingers brushing against your skin.\n\nWhile the day promises clarity, the veil of morning marine layer seems to linger softly, casting a muted gray over the early hours, whispering secrets of fog that might chase the horizon. As the day transitions into a partly cloudy evening, temperatures will drop into the comforting embrace of low 50s, accompanied by a continued playful breeze. A light heart and layers would suit you well; perhaps a cardigan over your shirt or a light jacket for when the evening dances in. With nature beckoning, a stroll along the waterfront would be lovely, or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 where you may indulge in a warm drink while watching the world unfurl around you\u2014a perfect day to savor the simple pleasures in life.",
