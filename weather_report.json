    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, you might feel a whisper of a cool breeze, carrying the promise of a soft drizzle that could tantalize the air close to midnight. The scene is blanketed in a solid fabric of clouds, with the atmospheric hues hinting at the dampness that lingers. With the temperature drifting towards a gentle 57 degrees, dressing in layers will be your best ally. A light jacket or sweater will fend off the chill, especially against the lively west-southwest winds that stir at about 10 to 18 mph, powerful enough to occasionally catch you off-guard with gusts reaching 23 mph.\n\nTomorrow dawns with a chance of early drizzle, yet hints of sunshine will attempt to break through, coaxing the day towards a mildHigh of around 66 degrees. It shapes up to be a delightful paradox, as cloudiness wrestles with brightness, setting the stage for a day of contrasting moods. With a breeze continuing to waft through the city at speeds of 9 to 23 mph, tomorrow invites you to stretch your legs\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll along Fort Mason, accompanied by the serene sound of waves kissing the shoreline, or a visit to a quaint coffee shop tucked away in the Marina District where the warmth of a cup can combat the lingering chill. Embrace the day\u2019s charm, for San Francisco always wears its moods with grace and allure.",
