A marine layer drifts in lazily, softening the lines of the cityscape, while the southwest wind whispers through the streets at a pace that evokes a certain calm. Tonight, temperatures will settle into the mid-fifties, making a light jacket a wise choice for those venturing out. The brisk breeze carries the scent of salt and the promise of fog rolling in from the bay, a quintessential touch in this coastal enclave.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the clouds will part to reveal a mostly sunny day, inviting sun-seekers to engage with the city\u2019s myriad charms. The high will hover around sixty-five, a comfortable warmth provided the wind doesn\u2019t carry too strong a bite. Dressing in layers will allow for seamless transitions from the cool morning air to an agreeable afternoon. Activities could include a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, followed by a stop at a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm drink\u2014an indulgent retreat amid the urban rhythm, where the clinking of cups punctuates the laughter that fills the air. Embrace the day, for it has the potential to cradle both peace and joy within its sunlight-soaked hours.",
