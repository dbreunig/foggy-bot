    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the cool air carries a subtle hint of moisture, whispering of fog that seems to linger just beyond the horizon. The outlook for today promises a splendid transformation, with a sunny disposition expected to sweep across the city by midday. The current temperature hovers in the lower fifties, accompanied by a brisk west wind that plays with the leaves and sends a few chills down one\u2019s spine, reminding everyone that this is the city by the bay. As the sun rises, the shadows will depart, paving the way for a gentle warmth that may reach into the upper fifties, an invitation for all to embrace the day.\n\nWith the forecast in mind, dressing in layers is advisable\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a relaxed shirt for the early hours, which can be shed as the sun unveils its charm. The marine layer may drift offshore, casting a veil that adds depth to the landscape, offering a chance to admire the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge emerging from the haze. Today is perfect for taking a stroll through the flower-lined streets of the Mission or seeking refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9 in North Beach, where the aroma of fresh pastries lingers in the air. As the city wakes, it beckons all to explore with a sense of warmth and discovery, promising an enjoyable day ahead.",
