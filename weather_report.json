    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a blanket of brilliant sunshine, accentuated by a gentle breeze that carries a whisper of the ocean's coolness. With temperatures hovering around a comfortable mid-sixties, the city is alive with the warm embrace of early summer, particularly inviting as the sun's golden rays cast playful shadows across the streets and parks. As daylight wanes, the evening is set to adopt a more mellow tone, transitioning towards mostly clear skies and light winds from the southwest, providing a serene backdrop for evening strolls or leisurely dinners al fresco.\n\nYet, as one gazes toward the horizon, the signature marine layer creeps imperceptibly into the city's nooks and crannies, hinting at the persistent dance between fog and sun. While it may linger discreetly at the edges, the day retains an inviting clarity, perfect for exploring lesser-known corners of the city or perhaps indulging in an uninterrupted read in a picturesque cafe. For those venturing outside, a light sweater or jacket may serve well as the sun dips and temperatures begin to drop, making it an ideal time for a quiet walk along the Embarcadero or a visit to one of the local art galleries nestled nearby.",
