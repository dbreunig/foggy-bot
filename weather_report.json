    "weather_report": "Dawn breaks gently over Downtown San Francisco, a city still caught in the embrace of a marine layer that whispers of drizzles past. The day hints at a shift\u2014behind the curtain of clouds, the sun awaits its cue. As temperatures hover around a cool 64 degrees, the bay\u2019s subtle chill nudges you toward layers, urging a light jacket or a soft sweater to ward off the brisk westward winds. The occasional gust, playful yet determined, carries with it the scent of the ocean as well as the promise of clearer skies by afternoon.\n\nThroughout the day, the fog will gradually recede, revealing the city\u2019s iconic structures framed against a backdrop of intermittent sunshine. With a 20% chance of precipitation lingering in the air, it's wise to carry an umbrella\u2014just in case. As evening approaches, clouds will blanket the horizon, and the coolness will settle again, making a cozy, quiet dinner quite appealing. Perhaps you will find a spot with a view, allowing you to revel in the shimmer of lights reflecting on the water while the city hums its evening lullaby.",
