    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco welcomes the late afternoon with a warm embrace of sunshine breaking through the lingering coolness of the day. The temperature hovers around a balmy sixty-four degrees, though a gentle west-southwest breeze flutters through, bringing a touch of refreshment with gusts that dance along at twenty miles per hour. The sky stretches out, a vivid sapphire, unmarred by clouds\u2014although the faint promise of a marine layer lurks, hinting at a slight chance of drizzle as the night creeps nearer.\n\nAs evening approaches, the air might turn a tad more humid, cloaked in clouds that suggest a more subdued ambiance. With temperatures expected to dip towards fifty-four, it\u2019s wise to layer up; a light jacket will serve as a perfect companion for those venturing out. The golden hour urges a stroll along the waterfront, where the reflections of the setting sun ripple on the bay's surface, inviting the soul into a moment of tranquility. Whether gazing across the waters at the majestic Golden Gate or exploring a quiet corner of a favorite caf\u00e9, this weather sets the stage for leisurely discovery in the heart of the city.",
