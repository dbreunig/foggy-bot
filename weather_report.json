    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco wraps itself in a modest but comforting embrace of mostly cloudy skies, settling into a balmy low around 52 degrees. A soft southwest breeze whispers through the streets, making it a night that invites you to explore yet still retains a certain coziness that draws you indoors. As the evening deepens, the city\u2019s lights begin to twinkle against the backdrop of a prismatic fog that rolls toward the shoreline, creating a dreamlike atmosphere.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Tuesday, you can expect the sun to push through intermittently, bathing the city in patches of warmth that promise a high near 61. The marine layer may briefly blanket the Golden Gate, adding an ethereal charm while parts of the city relish in the hazy sunlight. It\u2019s a day that feels refreshingly alive, marked by a mild wind gently nudging you along as you navigate the charming streets. For your attire, consider layers: perhaps a light sweater over a tee to ward off the morning chill, transitioning to a breezy shirt as the day progresses. Given the amiable conditions, why not stroll along the Embarcadero, savor the local artisanal coffee at a cozy caf\u00e9, or delve into the artistic enclave of the Mission? These simple pleasures resonate beautifully in a city that thrives in its enchanting atmosphere.",
