    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a canopy of muted gray, a testament to the city's ever-present marine layer that hangs lazily in the sky. The temperature flirts gently with 63 degrees, complemented by a brisk west wind that carries whispers of the ocean. As you navigate the winding streets today, you\u2019ll find the atmosphere thick with a gentle mist, which softens the edges of the iconic skyline, casting a tranquil yet somewhat somber mood throughout the day.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds will persist, and the temperature will dip just enough to require consideration for extra layers. A light sweater or jacket will suffice against the coolness of the night air, which hovers around 56 degrees. For those eager to enjoy this evening's subtle charm, a stroll along the Embarcadero or an intimate sit at a local caf\u00e9 becomes an inviting option, allowing for the appreciation of softly illuminated buildings against the twilight. With the clouds overhead and a gentle breeze guiding your path, an evening out promises a cozy reprieve that is quintessentially San Francisco.",
