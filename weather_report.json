    "weather_report": "In the early hours over Downtown San Francisco, the city is cocooned in a shroud of clouds, whispering secrets of a night still heavy with possibility. The gentle southeast wind carries the chill of coastal air, wrapping around the trees and buildings, hinting at the fog that may creep in from the bay. As dawn approaches, the promise of sun flickers just on the horizon, though a slight chance of rain earlier in the morning adds a touch of uncertainty. The day is expected to mellow into a partly sunny affair, but those cherishing warmth may find the high only dipping briefly into the low 60s. \n\nFor those stepping out, a light jacket will be your companion, shielding against the brisk breeze and the lingering coolness of the morning. The sky may remain mottled, with glimpses of blue scattered amid the clouds, suggesting a backdrop perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero as the city awakens. Perhaps a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9 for a steaming cup of coffee would be pleasing, or a stroll through the garden at Golden Gate Park, where the foliage, kissed by the evening's fog, invites the soul to linger. The day stretches ahead, ripe with the richness of everyday adventures, where even the mundane can become a moment of grace.",
