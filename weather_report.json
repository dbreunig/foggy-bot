    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a delicate veil of clouds hangs over the city as night descends, echoing the whispered stories of the Bay. The temperatures gently settle, cradled around 57 degrees, while a brisk west-southwest wind weaves through the streets, offering a refreshing bite that hints at the incoming coastal chill. Those out this evening might find comfort in a light jacket, particularly if venturing towards the waterfront where the breezes are keen. \n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, the clouds will gradually part to reveal patches of blue, allowing a teasing glimpse of sunlight to warm the city's renowned hills. Daytime temperatures are expected to hover around 65 degrees, dipping slightly as afternoon takes hold. The afternoon sky, with its playful dance of sunlight and shadow, will invite locals to seize the moment under the brisk, energizing winds that may gust to 29 mph. One might contemplate a stroll through the vibrant streets of the Tenderloin or a leisurely bike ride along the Embarcadero, savoring the invigorating freshness of the day. In the gentle embrace of this San Francisco summer morn, the city beckons towards spontaneity amidst the softness of the marine layer, making it an ideal backdrop for wandering and wonder alike.",
