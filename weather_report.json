    "weather_report": "A gentle afternoon unveils itself across Downtown San Francisco, where the sun casts its warm glow, inviting locals and visitors alike to embrace the outdoors. The high temperature flirts with the mid-sixties, nudged slightly cooler by tender afternoon breezes. The clouds linger on the horizon but are hesitant to encroach upon the brilliant blue, conjuring an air of optimism. As daylight gradually surrenders to evening, the forecast hints at a descent into a more somber palette, with temperatures dipping to the soft embrace of fifty degrees amidst whispering winds from the west.\n\nWhile the day appears inviting, the urban landscape hints at a lingering marine layer, its delicate tendrils holding vigil over the bay. Fog, woven into the fabric of San Francisco life, teeters along the coastline yet remains distant, allowing for expansive views and vibrant clarity at this hour. Consider a light jacket to ward off the briskness as twilight approaches, complemented by comfortable layers for an afternoon stroll through the bustling streets or a leisurely moment in a nearby park, reveling in the crispness of the air. As the sun begins its descent, one might find solace in a nearby caf\u00e9, sipping a warm drink while absorbing the soft transition from day to night.",
