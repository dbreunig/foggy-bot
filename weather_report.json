    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle cloak of moisture hovers in the air, hinting at the potential for light drizzle. This morning greets the city wrapped in the familiar embrace of cloud cover that will gradually yield to glimpses of sun. By midday, expect the skies to become partly sunny, inviting residents to emerge and breathe in the cool, refreshing breeze carried in from the west-southwest. The air feels crisp, with temperatures hovering comfortably around the mid-60s, making it the perfect time for a leisurely stroll through local parks or along the waterfront. \n\nYet, the marine layer holds sway, particularly near the coast, where tendrils of fog may still linger, a characteristic sight for this iconic city. It\u2019s a day where layering is wise; a light jacket would fend off the chill when the wind picks up, especially in exposed areas. Perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 with a view\u2014where the charm of the city unfolds beneath a shifting sky\u2014might be the best way to embrace the day. The muted hues of the landscape beckon quieter reflections and subtle adventures, as the lingering coolness of morning transitions into the warmth of the brighter afternoon.",
