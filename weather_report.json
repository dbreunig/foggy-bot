    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night carries whispers of a soft marine layer, making its presence known with a shroud of clouds that hang gently in the air. A low of around 56 degrees blankets the city, inviting those awake to wrap themselves in light layers of comfort. As dawn approaches, hope shines through the forecast of a sunny Thursday, where the warmth of the sun breaks through the clouds, bringing with it a high that flirts with the 66-degree mark. The gentle caress of a west-southwest wind carries a hint of salt from the nearby bay, swirling through the streets and punctuating the calm with refreshing breezes.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the san Francisco skyline will emerge proudly under a cerulean sky, revealing the city's architectural beauty against the backdrop of the northern coastline. Those seeking to explore the streets may find joy in a light jacket or a cozy sweater; the coolness of the morning will gradually yield to pleasant warmth by the afternoon, painting a perfect backdrop for strolls along the Embarcadero or visits to the vibrant local caf\u00e9s. The forecast suggests dwindling cloud cover, opening the day to those eager to seize the opportunity, whether it be casual gatherings at parks or perhaps a leisurely book read at one of the city\u2019s charming corners. The marine layer will retreat, revealing the iconic vistas and inviting all to bask in the delightful San Francisco charm.",
