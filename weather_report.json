    "weather_report": "As daylight wanes over Downtown San Francisco this Labor Day evening, a splendid calm envelops the city. The sun has bestowed its warmth throughout the day, creating a high of around 73, the air invigorated by a gentle west-southwest wind, whispering softly at about 16 mph. As you wander the streets, the atmosphere feels crisp yet inviting. The clarity of the day is apparent, though a delicate veil of marine layer lingers close to the Golden Gate, hinting at the enchantment of fog that could roll in as night approaches.\n\nTonight, the forecast hints at a subtle shift, with a low settling around 58 degrees. Patchy drizzle could weave its way in after 11 p.m., leaving the air fresh and the structures glistening like jewels. The chance is modest but noteworthy; a light jacket becomes essential as you transition from the warm embrace of the day to the cooler evening air. Engage in leisurely strolls along the waterfront, the twinkling lights of the city reflecting off the Bay, or perhaps venture into a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring the moments that quietly stitch together a lovely holiday evening.",
