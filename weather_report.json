    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of gentle clouds cloaks the city, offering a serene view framed against the twinkling lights. Tonight\u2019s low temperature hovers comfortably around 51 degrees, while a mild southwest breeze stirs through at about 5 miles per hour. The air is tinged with the crispness characteristic of coastal San Francisco, yet remains welcoming for those seeking solace in the evening's embrace. Be aware of the fog that hass lightly settled just over the bay, hinting at the ever-present marine layer, which may crinkle the edges of your plans.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, expect the city to greet the dawn under a radiant sun breaking through, revealing a high near 65. Afternoon temperatures will gently descend to around 62, rendering it a splendid day to wander the streets or explore the shoreline. While dressing for the day, layers would be wise; a light sweater or jacket will serve well against the cool breeze, while a t-shirt or blouse beneath will keep you comfortable in the mild warmth of the midday sun. With the expected clarity, a stroll along Crissy Field or a quiet coffee at a local caf\u00e9 can make for a pleasing engagement, allowing the beauty of the day to unfurl before you, wrapping you in a fabric of tranquility.",
