    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, the evening brings a gentle shroud of clouds, softening the edges of the city. The low hangs around a comfortable 56 degrees, accompanied by a west wind that brushes through, a playful whisper tinged with the promise of a cooler night. Though the sky has draped itself in gray, it is not a persistent fog that cloaks the landscape, but rather a mellow layer that hints at the brightness of the day to come.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, one can anticipate a transition under partly sunny skies, with temperatures peeking at a modest 63 degrees. Morning will greet early risers with warmth just in time for brunch, while the afternoon invites those with a longing for a breeze and a coffee in hand to wander the Embarcadero or explore local galleries. As the day begins to unfold, it will be wise to don layers; a light jacket will stave off any lingering chill, especially when navigating those breezy corners. Overall, it\u2019s a blend of pleasant Oakland Bay Day vibes and laid-back San Francisco cool, perfect for a long walk along the waterfront or a quiet chat over tea, beckoning one to savor the simple joys of the city.",
