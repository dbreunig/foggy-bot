    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Downtown San Francisco, a soft drizzle brushes against the city streets, a gentle reminder of the marine layer that often blankets this enchanting locale. The clouds gather, shrouding the horizon yet leaving a slight promise of the sun's presence for the morrow. With the temperature cooling down to the low sixties and a light breeze whispering from the west, an evening walk feels delightfully brisk, punctuated by the sounds of the urban symphony that hums through the air. Visibility may waver under the thickening cloud above, but the dim glow of streetlights creates a cozy ambiance, perfect for those seeking solace in the city's quieter corners.\n\nTomorrow promises a transformation, where the patchy drizzle should linger in the morning but eventually yield to the warmth of the sun. Though temperatures will hover near a pleasant sixty-eight degrees, donning layers will be wise, as the chill will still be felt in the air, particularly in the later hours. For those longing to enjoy the day outside, a stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s sounds appealing. Grab a good book, find a spot with gentle sunshine peeking through the clouds, and simply breathe in the rich tapestry of city life, a blend of both the urban hustle and the tranquil moments that define this unique city.",
