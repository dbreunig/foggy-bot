    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a bright sun, casting a gentle glow over the city. Wispy clouds drift lazily across the sky, but they are not the dense veil of fog that often blankets this iconic landscape. Temperatures linger around a comfortable 62 degrees, with a robust west-southwest wind making its presence felt, whisking through the streets, slightly cooling the air and ruffling the leaves of nearby trees. This airiness complements the day's clarity, as it appears that the marine layer is holding back just beyond the Golden Gate, promising beautifully defined vistas for those who look to the horizon.\n\nAs evening approaches, the warmth eases into a pleasantly mild sensation, hovering around a cozy 55 degrees. An inviting evening awaits, perfect for a leisurely stroll through the Golden Gate Park or a quiet gathering at one of the outdoor cafes. Those venturing out should consider a light jacket to counter the evening breeze, ideally paired with layers for comfort. The winds remain playful, but while they stir the leaves, they also invite a sense of adventure, nudging one outdoors to relish the harmony of sunlit streets fading into twilight.",
