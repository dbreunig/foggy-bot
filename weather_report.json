    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a gentle touch of promise, where the lingering veil of last night\u2019s drizzle gives way to partial clarity. The air, fresh and crisp, carries a hint of the sea, as soft breezes dance through the streets, whispering the secrets of the Bay. While the sun begins to assert its presence, casting a warm glow, one might say the sky remains wearing a delicate cloak of clouds, hinting at the depth of the marine layer that colors the horizon with muted tones. The iconic outline of the Golden Gate stands distant yet proud, slightly veiled, reminding us of the city\u2019s ever-changing canvas.\n\nAs the day progresses, expect the gentle warmth to peak around 65 degrees, settling softly around 63 by afternoon, inviting a leisurely day under the wide, yet partially obscured, expanse overhead. Dressing in layers will serve you well; a light jacket or a cozy sweater will provide comfort against the brisk wind that will flirt with gusts of up to 23 mph\u2014a faithful companion to those brave enough to venture outside. Today\u2019s weather beckons you to stroll along the waterfront or perhaps sip a warm coffee in a quiet caf\u00e9, soaking in the unique ambiance of this splendid city as it transitions into nighttime\u2019s embrace.",
