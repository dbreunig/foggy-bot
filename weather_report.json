    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the essence of summer is gently unfurling beneath a canopy of sun, revealing the city\u2019s iconic vistas in a muted brilliance. The temperature hovers around a comfortable 65 degrees, with a modest breeze weaving through the streets at 14 miles per hour, guiding the drift of laughter and conversation. As the day progresses, the comforting warmth softens into a gentle chill, perfect for strolling along Market Street or seeking refuge in a nearby caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh pastries mingles enticingly with the coolness of the air.\n\nAs twilight approaches, a whisper of drizzle may grace the city after 2 a.m., hinting at an impending embrace of clouds. The night will retreat into a low of around 55, making light jackets a wise choice for evening outings or those late-night wanderings under the soft glow of street lamps. The prospect of a quiet evening, perhaps spent enjoying a book in one of the city's cozy nooks or contemplating life\u2019s mysteries from the heights of a hillside park, beckons invitingly. The marine layer is present, but for this moment, it allows the sun to tease through, creating a scene where one might feel both alive and inexplicably calm.",
