    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, a gentle ballet of clouds dances across the night sky, juxtaposed against the shimmering city lights. The air is cool, a refreshing embrace lingering about 54 degrees, as a southwest wind whispers through the streets, hinting at the promise of tomorrow. As the sun rises, it will unveil a mostly sunny canvas, with temperatures expected to warm to a comfortable 65, before settling back into the coolness of the afternoon around 63. \n\nFor those venturing out, a light jacket will suffice amid the brisk breeze, particularly as gusts may reach up to 29 mph later in the day. The horizon may reveal muted colors at dawn, with a fleeting touch of fog hinting at the greater expanse of the bay, though clarity will soon break through as daytime graces the city. A morning stroll through a quiet park or a leisurely coffee on a sunlit patio could provide the perfect start to your day, allowing you to engage with the unique charm of San Francisco as it gradually awakens.",
