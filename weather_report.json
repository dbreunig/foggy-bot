    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle chill hangs in the air, signaling the lingering grips of a marine layer that cloaks the city. The clouds are mostly scattered, allowing fleeting glimpses of what promises to be a vibrant afternoon, yet the cool west-southwest winds hint at a typical San Francisco day. With temperatures gently lowering from 65 to 63 later, the weather maintains a crispness that can easily chill unsuspecting visitors. Those venturing outdoors should consider layering; a light sweater or jacket will serve well against the breeze, especially in the morning and early evening.\n\nWhile the sun makes its slow ascent, the fog may still linger around the Golden Gate, blurring its iconic silhouette for the moment, while other parts of the bay may remain bathed in a gentle glow, charming in their understated beauty. This weather invites leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet moment with coffee at a cafe, watching the bustle of city life unfold. As twilight approaches, the low clouds will soften the city\u2019s lights, casting a romantic spell that beckons evening walks under the tranquil embrace of the city\u2019s famed fog.",
