    "weather_report": "The skies above Downtown San Francisco are showcasing a canvas of dramatic contrasts this afternoon, brushing aside the fog that often blankets the city. With the sun shining brightly, a gentle warmth lingers around the high sixties, while steadfast winds dance through the streets, carrying with them whispers of the sea. The air is crisp, invigorating even, as hints of a soft marine layer brush along the edges of the horizon but largely yield to clear, blue expanses above. \n\nAs dusk approaches, a touch of cloudiness will find its way in, perhaps offering a slight drizzle after eleven, although it seems the city is content to bask in the sunshine for now. It\u2019s a wonderful time to take a relaxed stroll along the promenades, or perhaps indulge in a quiet caf\u00e9 visit, where the bustle outside softens into a distant hum. Warmer layers will serve well, tempered by the brisk winds of the afternoon, ensuring comfort as the temperature dips towards evening. Choose an ensemble that embraces the cool yet remains light, perfect for a leisurely exploration of the city as the sun sinks low, painting the sky in subtle hues of twilight.",
