    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco presents a scene of gentle transition, where the sun occasionally breaks through the haze to cast a soft glow on the city's iconic skyline. With temperatures hovering around a pleasant 66 degrees, the air carries a light breeze from the west southwest, reminiscent of a whisper among the trees. There is a slight chill, especially as the afternoon wanes and the temperatures ease down to about 64, hinting at the evening ahead.\n\nAs twilight approaches, clouds will gather, and a hint of drizzle may dance through the air after 11 PM, suggesting a subtle romance with the night. A low of about 59 degrees beckons, and it may be wise to reach for a light sweater or jacket as layers will serve you best in this capricious weather. While the famed fog might obscure the far views typically enjoyed from the heights of Sutro Tower, it is unlikely to blanket the city completely, allowing for moments of clarity that are simply enchanting. The evening is ideal for an easy stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet caf\u00e9 visit, where one can savor a warm drink as the flavors of San Francisco mingle with the cool, damp night air.",
