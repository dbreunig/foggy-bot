    "weather_report": "In the golden afternoon light of Downtown San Francisco, patches of warmth mingle with an invigorating breeze, painting a picture of the kind of day that falls beautifully between the chill of winter and the inexorable advance of summer. Today's sun stretches above the horizon, illuminating the city with a soft glow, although a hint of the fading marine layer dances at the edges, teasing the hustle and bustle below. As the day matures toward the afternoon, expect temperatures to gently recede, providing a comfortable coolness that encourages both wanderers and residents to step outside.\n\nThe winds, strong yet refreshing, traverse the city\u2019s heights, inviting those dressed in light layers to embrace the vibrant streets. A light jacket would serve well for an afternoon stroll along the Embarcadero, where the sea breeze mingles with the scent of fresh coffee wafting from nearby caf\u00e9s. For those seeking a reprieve from their to-do lists, the tranquility of nearby parks calls, promising a moment to soak in the scenery and sounds of the sun-dappled day. As night approaches, the skies will indulge in a modest cloud cover, wrapping the city in a delicate embrace, perfect for settling into quieter evening plans filled with conversation and intimacy.",
