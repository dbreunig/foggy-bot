    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon finds a tentative truce between the sun and the cloud cover, with scattered glimpses of sunlight breaking through the veil of stratus. The temperature is gently falling, each degree carried off by the steady westerly breeze that whispers at around 13 mph, stirring the chill from the nearby ocean with every gust. The air carries a hint of moisture, a soft promise of rain lying just beyond the horizon, with a 40% chance of gentle showers expected later in the night, wrapping the evening in a cool embrace as temperatures dip to around 50 degrees.\n\nWhile the vistas may be partially obscured, a hint of character remains in the atmosphere. Should one venture out, a light jacket or sweater would be wise, ideally layered over a comfortable shirt to adapt to the day\u2019s moods. It's a perfect moment for an amble through the nearby parks or a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the city\u2019s spirit dances through the spaces between grey clouds. Perhaps a quiet caf\u00e9 could beckon, offering warm brews while the world outside glimmers with the promise of fleeting sunshine amid shifting shadows and soft rain.",
