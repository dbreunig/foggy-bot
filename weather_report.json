    "weather_report": "As dusk descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the city's charm becomes more pronounced against a backdrop of soft, understated beauty. The sky, a painting of gentle blues and muted grays, hints at warmth while also embracing the cool kiss of the evening breeze. Tonight\u2019s low settles around a crisp 47 degrees, drawing you toward a light jacket or perhaps a cozy sweater as you meander through the streets. The wind stirs lightly from the west-northwest, whispering through the avenues and stirring the fragrant air.\n\nTomorrow promises a sunny reprieve, where the high nears an inviting 60 degrees, though the afternoon may bathe you in what feels like the gentle chill of the coast as temperatures dip slightly. Today, the city stands mostly clear, devoid of the fog that often shrouds its iconic structures. The absence of the marine layer allows the skyline to breathe freely, and as you plan your evening, consider wandering toward one of the waterfront cafes or perhaps taking a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero as the sun sinks low, painting the Bay in hues of golden pink. Embrace the subtlety of a San Francisco night, where every shadow and whisper of wind beckons you to explore just a little longer.",
