Currently, the air is crisp, maintaining a comfortable low that invites a light jacket or soft hoodie\u2014perfect for those early morning excursions or leisurely strolls along the waterfront. The tranquility of the morning is punctuated by a whisper of a southwest breeze, barely stirring the leaves, yet hinting at the warmth that will come, lifting the fog that often lingers in the bay.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the sunshine to break through as the clouds thin, coaxing temperatures up towards the low sixties. This soothing shift in weather could inspire a visit to the nearby parks where vibrant greens contrast beautifully with the azure sky. With temperatures anticipated to drop slightly in the afternoon, layering is wise\u2014perhaps a simple tee beneath that favored light jacket for comfort. The absence of thick fog over the city today reveals the Golden Gate Bridge in all its glory, urging residents and visitors alike to engage with the city\u2019s atmosphere, perhaps by indulging in a leisurely bike ride along the Embarcadero or sipping coffee at a cozy caf\u00e9, watching the world awaken around them.",
