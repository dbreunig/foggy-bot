With the clarity of the sky, streaked only by wisps of distant cloud, the day is warming gently, though the high will settle near a cool 61 degrees. The west wind rustles lightly at around 10 mph, carrying with it the crisp promise of spring. As the afternoon wanes, temperatures are expected to dip into the 50s, a reminder of the ever-looming coolness this city is known for. \n\nAs evening approaches, a mostly clear night unfurls before us, with temperatures settling around a brisk 46 degrees. The very light southwest breeze whispers softly, inviting a cozy attire of layers; a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the coolness that prevails. This weather blossoms with potential for quiet adventures\u2014a stroll through the heart of the city as the sun begins to dip, or perhaps a gentle gathering over coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, surrounded by the city\u2019s distinct architecture and the distant murmur of the bay. The absence of fog today enhances the charm of the urban landscape, allowing for uninhibited views toward the Golden Gate, bathing the city in a luminous embrace well into the evening.",
