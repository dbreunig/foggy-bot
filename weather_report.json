    "weather_report": "As evening envelops Downtown San Francisco, a gentle layer of clouds begins to drape the sky, while a cool breeze whispers through the streets, hinting at the slight chance of rain that may grace the city after nightfall. The temperature settles around a mild 53 degrees, a comfortable brush against the skin for those wrapped in light layers as the daylight wanes. The air carries a hint of moisture, a marker of what might be a short-lived shower, yet for now, the prevailing mood is one of serene uncertainty. The night sky, especially to the north, is cloaked in nuances of gray, while the southern skyline remains steadfast, offering a stark contrast to the encroaching dusk.\n\nTomorrow\u2019s forecast echoes this subtle anticipation of rain, starting the day under clouds with a mere whisper of moisture before 11 AM. Highs will hover near 62 degrees, but as the day progresses, the temperature is expected to dip slightly, ushering in that signature San Francisco chill. Best attire would be layers \u2013 perhaps a light sweater or jacket complemented by a knit scarf \u2013 perfect for transition from the humid embrace of the morning to the more invigorating afternoon chill. Consider a quiet afternoon wandering through local galleries or cafes; the muted ambiance perfectly complements a book or an indulgent cup of coffee. One might even take a stroll along the nearby waterfront, where the views are often clear but can quickly shift, reminding us that in this city, the beauty lies as much in the unexpected as in the expected.",
