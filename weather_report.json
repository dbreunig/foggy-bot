While temperatures hover around a pleasant 62 degrees, there's a gentle fall to about 60 as afternoon descends\u2014an echo of the coastal air that balances warmth with an inviting coolness. The southwestern breeze, a subtle whisper at 3 to 10 mph, adds a soothing quality to the atmosphere, making it a delightful day for a stroll among the bustling streets.\n\nAs the evening approaches, expect a delicate layer of patchy fog to weave through the city, kissing the ground between 3am and 5am. Tonight will usher in somewhat cloudier skies, and as temperatures dip to around 50, it may be wise to layer your attire with a light jacket and perhaps a scarf to ward off the chill. The blend of the crisp air and the fog beckons one to explore local caf\u00e9s for a warm brew or to take a quiet walk along the shore, breathing in the fresh sea air that mingles with the night's tranquility.",
