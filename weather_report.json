    "weather_report": "The early hours of Sunday in Downtown San Francisco find the city embracing the gentle embrace of lingering clouds, perhaps offering a soft drizzle as a nod to the typical marine layer that drapes over this coastal haven. With the low hovering around a comfortable 56 degrees, one might consider a light sweater or a windbreaker\u2014a tender shield against the notable west-southwest breezes teasing the city streets. \n\nAs the day unfolds, a modest chance of drizzle lingers until late morning, but by then, indifferent clouds will break to unveil a partly sunny disposition, with temperatures reaching a pleasant high near 63 degrees. The winds will remain favorable, fluttering between 7 to 14 mph and occasionally gusting, rustling leaves and whispering secrets of the bay. With this mild weather, the day invites a stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps a leisurely exploration of the local caf\u00e9 scene, or a moment spent savoring the atmosphere at one of the small parks, where the scent of fresh pastries mingles with salty air. Dress for warmth, embrace the coastal charm, and let the dynamic rhythm of San Francisco inspire a day of quiet adventure.",
