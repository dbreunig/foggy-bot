    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle embrace of clouds hangs in the air, weaving an atmospheric tapestry that speaks to the city's character. The current temperature hovers around 53 degrees, with a cool west wind whistling softly at 7 to 14 mph, slinging wisps of chilled breeze across the streets. The horizon, obscured perhaps by the presence of a marine layer, lends an air of mystery to the skyline; the golden light of the setting sun struggles to break through, casting a muted glow on the historic architecture. \n\nLooking ahead to Memorial Day, the forecast promises a welcome transition into a sunny disposition, the skies expected to burst forth with rays of warmth, accentuating the vibrant pulse of the city. Should your plans lead you outdoors tomorrow, consider dressing in layers, a light jacket or cardigan essential against the lingering chill. Tonight, the sights and sounds of the city come alive, inviting you to explore the less-traveled alleys or savor a quiet meal at a cozy bistro, where the warm atmosphere is sure to soothe any remnants of the day\u2019s coolness.",
