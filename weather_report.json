With temperatures settling around a mild 56 degrees, the partly cloudy skies allow brief glimpses of twilight\u2014a gentle reminder of summer's embrace, softened by the west-southwest winds that whisper through the city streets. Gusts reaching up to 26 mph bring a lively energy, ruffling the leaves and beckoning one to venture outdoors, perhaps with a light jacket or a cozy sweater to ward off the cooler air.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the forecast hints at the tantalizing possibility of drizzle, particularly in the later afternoon. Expect a flirtation of sun amid the clouds, casting a subtle glow over the iconic landscape\u2014all while a marine layer might linger just at the edges of the horizon, shrouding the more distant views in a veil of mystery. This is a day best filled with casual strolls through local shops, intimate coffee breaks in charming caf\u00e9s, or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s lush parks as the gentle breeze carries the scent of the ocean. As you prepare, think of layering\u2014maybe a light scarf to add a touch of warmth and personality\u2014as the day reveals itself in delightful San Francisco fashion.",
