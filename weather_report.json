    "weather_report": "In the hushed hours of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco lies beneath a blanket of partly cloudy skies, an atmosphere tinged with the chill of night. The air, crisp and fresh, promises a low just above forty degrees, while a gentle southeast breeze whispers through the city, stirring the dormant energy waiting to awaken with the dawn. As Sunday emerges, the clouds will thicken, veiling the sun and casting a muted pallor over the landmarks that define this iconic landscape. The day will announce itself with a hint of rain after eight, and the probability of a light shower hangs around thirty percent. A high of fifty-nine degrees signals the need for layers \u2014 perhaps a light sweater or a well-worn jacket to mitigate the brisk wind sweeping in from the south, which could gust up to thirty-five miles per hour.\n\nThough the clarity of the cityscape is tempered by the anticipated marine layer, a touch of mystery envelops the Golden Gate Bridge, which stretches its emblematic silhouette toward the sky. The fog\u2019s retreat may reveal golden glimpses of this famed structure throughout the day, contrasting with the gray setting. To enjoy this day, one might stroll along the Embarcadero, taking in the conversations of passersby, the symphony of the waves against the shore, or perhaps lose oneself in the winding streets of North Beach, stopping in at that corner caf\u00e9 bustling with the aroma of fresh pastries and the rich scent of coffee. It is a day that calls for exploration, wrapped in the comforting embrace of the city\u2019s unique charm, where even the clouds can feel like a soft embrace.",
