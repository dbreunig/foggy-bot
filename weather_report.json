    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a bright, sunny sky, with temperatures reaching a comfortable 66 degrees. The vibrant sun casts its generous glow, although whispers of a cool breeze linger, offering gentle relief as gusts swirl in from the west. Despite the promise of warmth, a nautical patchwork hints at the ever-present marine layer, just beyond the Golden Gate, where fog teases the edges of the bay, spilling languorously over the horizon. \n\nAs the evening draws closer, the heavens will transition into a partly cloudy canvas, allowing remnants of sunlight to dance with shadows until twilight sets in at around 54 degrees. To embrace the day, visitors might don light layers\u2014a comfortable shirt paired with a light jacket or cardigan to safeguard against evening chills. An afternoon stroll along the waterfront would be revitalizing, or perhaps unwinding at a local caf\u00e9, savoring the city\u2019s rich aroma and vibrant spirit. As the day winds down, San Francisco's charm shines brighter than the sun itself, inviting all to linger just a little longer before nightfall.",
