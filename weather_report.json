    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this morning, a cool haze lingers in the air, painted with the promise of a fleeting brightness just beyond the clouds. The city is waking to the gentle drift of moisture, as hints of rain whisper against the skyline. With temperatures nudging at 61, the chill of the southwest wind carries a vitality tinged with briskness, while the coastal fog pushes slightly inland, softening the outlines of the Golden Gate and clinging to the iconic hills.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the chance of rain remains a companion, alongside patches of sun attempting to break through the cloud cover. With the forecast promising a refinement in the weather, the afternoon may well gift us with clearer skies, but anticipation of rain lingers. Given these conditions, layering is the key; a light waterproof jacket over a cozy sweater will serve you well against the wind and the unpredictable sprinkles. In such an urban landscape, consider a leisurely walk through the quieter streets or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where one can enjoy a warm drink while watching the city evolve in soft shades of grey and blue.",
