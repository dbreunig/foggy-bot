    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco embraces a tranquil clarity, with the low gently resting around 60 degrees. A soft, southwest breeze stirs the air, whispering hints of warmth while ensuring that the evening remains comfortable. As night descends, the skyline gleams against a canvas of mostly clear skies, creating a serene ambiance perfect for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or quiet reflections in a cozy caf\u00e9.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Tuesday, the day promises vibrant sunshine, with temperatures peaking near 81, though a gentle fall to about 77 will herald the afternoon. The west-northwest winds will playfully weave through the streets, enhancing the warmth and inviting San Franciscans outdoors. With such inviting weather, it\u2019s a splendid opportunity to explore the lush expanses of Golden Gate Park or savor a leisurely picnic by the waterfront. To embrace the day, light layers are advisable, allowing for a graceful transition from the cooler morning to the afternoon glow. The absence of fog accentuates the beauty of the city, making it an ideal day for adventure.",
