    "weather_report": "As the sun settles toward the horizon, Downtown San Francisco wraps itself in a gentle embrace of twilight, the air crisp with a hint of the ocean\u2019s breath. Tonight, the skies are mostly clear, revealing a backdrop of fading blue with a low around 52 degrees. A brisk west wind stirs from 7 to 18 mph, occasionally gusting up to 25 mph, lending an invigorating edge to the evening air. Ideal for a leisurely stroll, it beckons those with a taste for movement to wander along Embarcadero, where the waters shimmer with the last light of day.\n\nMoving into Sunday, expect a bright and cheerful morning that transitions into a sunny day, with temperatures peaking near 64 degrees. Winds will continue from the west-southwest, offering a playful gust here and there, making it wise to layer up slightly. A light jacket or sweater should suffice for those out exploring the city's treasures, from the charming nooks of North Beach to the buoyant atmosphere of the Ferry Building Marketplace. The absence of fog today adds to the clarity of the cityscape, inviting you to appreciate the sights without the usual marine veil. It\u2019s a splendid moment to savor a warm coffee al fresco while contemplating your next quiet adventure in this vibrant metropolis as the day unfolds.",
