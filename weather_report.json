    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a largely sunny sky, presenting a serene tableau highlighted by the distant margins of the Golden Gate. As the day tilts toward twilight with temperatures gracefully descending to the mid-fifties, the gentle west wind dances through the streets at about thirteen miles per hour, scattering the lingerings of marine haze that often embrace the city. This afternoon\u2019s clear horizon hints at high visibility, allowing the iconic cityscape to stand proud and sharp against the backdrop of the sky\u2014a blend of cerulean and wispy clouds that whisper of spring's arrival.\n\nAs the sun prepares for its descent, a low of around fifty degrees invites one to dress in layers, perhaps embracing a light jacket to ward off the evening chill. With the day winding down, it\u2019s a delightful occasion for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the water glimmers and the world transitions into softer shades. A visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s could also provide a pleasant respite, allowing one to savor a warm drink while absorbing the modern vibrance of the streets.",
