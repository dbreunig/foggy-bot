    "weather_report": "In the twilight of Downtown San Francisco, the evening air takes on a crispness, punctuated by the hint of fog that will soon greet the break of dawn. The temperature nestles comfortably around that cool mark of 49 degrees, yet the gentle embrace of a west wind whispers of warmer mornings ahead. The city is currently adorned in a cloak of quietude, with the hints of life softened by a thin veil of mist that will soon dissolve under the first golden rays of sunlight.\n\nAs dawn approaches, patchy fog will unfurl before the sun claims the day, ushering in a scene of blue skies and mild brightness, with afternoon temperatures hovering near the soothing embrace of 66 degrees. The day is poised to be pleasant, inviting those with a penchant for exploration to don light layers\u2014perhaps a breathable sweater accompanied by a light jacket, perfect for wandering the streets or indulging in leisurely coffee at a corner caf\u00e9. For the heartier adventure-seekers, a stroll along the waterfront path promises views unmarred by fog, while the fresh morning breeze invigorates the spirit. Engage in simple pleasures beneath a mostly sunny sky, as the city begins to flourish, casting aside its nocturnal tranquility.",
