With temperatures settling around a pleasant 62 degrees, the crisp air carries a gentle breeze from the west southwest, its movement just enough to refresh the spirit\u2014but not so brisk as to chill. As the shadows deepen, a gradual descent to about 60 degrees is expected, accompanied by occasional gusts that flirt with 18 mph, leaving an invigorating impression on the skin.\n\nTonight, a shift is anticipated\u2014mostly cloudy skies will blanket the city, with a low creeping to 53 degrees, hinting at the cooler embrace of the evening. The air, still lively with a moderate breeze, whispers of the marine layer's presence, particularly in the western reaches where a subtle fog often dances along the coastline. To navigate these shifting conditions with style, layering is encouraged. A light jacket or sweater over a casual shirt will be your ally as you stroll through the neighborhoods or settle in at a cozy caf\u00e9. As evening approaches, a delightful walk along the Embarcadero might reveal the silhouettes of the bay\u2019s familiar landmarks, softened by the encroaching clouds\u2014a perfect scene to unwind and reflect on the day\u2019s beauty.",
