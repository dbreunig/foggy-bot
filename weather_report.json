    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a serene evening unfolds. The sky is predominantly clear, a delicate balance of fading daylight and the arrival of a gentle night. With a comfortable low of around fifty-five degrees, the west-northwest wind whispers softly, easing in at six to nine mph. Tonight offers a pleasant escape from the bustling day, inviting you to take a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps settle into one of the city's inviting cafes that seem to glow warmly under the twinkling lights.\n\nTomorrow greets us with the promise of a sunny day, peeking through with a high near sixty-six that gradually subsides to around sixty-one by afternoon. With the west-southwest wind invigorating the air at six to thirteen mph, a light jacket or sweater would suit you well, as the ocean's cool embrace lingers nearby, particularly in the shaded corners of this ever-dynamic city. The marine layer may just blur the horizon where land meets sea, an ethereal shroud that adds to the charm of San Francisco, but it doesn\u2019t impede the uplifting brightness of the day ahead. It\u2019s a perfect moment to explore the pristine beauty of Golden Gate Park or wander through the vibrant streets filled with art and flavor, making memories beneath the California sun.",
