    "weather_report": "The night air in Downtown San Francisco lingers with a teasing coolness, a whisper of drizzle possible under the protective cloak of low clouds wrapping the city. As the city stirs to life, there\u2019s a gentle promise hung in the air; the chill will rest around 54 degrees, carried by a restless west-southwest wind nudging through the streets. The brushes of morning fog linger but are subtle, leaving an almost ethereal feeling. \n\nAs the day unfolds, expect a light-hearted break with fluttering hints of sun peeking through mostly sunny skies, beckoning you to revel in the early summer's warmth, albeit briefly. The high reaches around 64 degrees, dipping into the early afternoon\u2019s embrace of 61. With winds picking up momentum, it might be wise to don layers \u2014 a light jacket could fend off the brisk air while you venture through the neighborhood, perhaps stopping by a quaint caf\u00e9 or easing into a gentle stroll along the waterfront, where the playful dance of fog kisses the bay. This fleeting interlude of sunshine juxtaposed against the remnants of the marine layer paints a canvas inviting enough for a moment of stillness amid the city's vibrant pulse.",
