    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a calm sun, its golden touch illuminating the cityscape albeit with a gentle hand. The temperature hovers around a cool 61 degrees, gradually settling into a cozy 59 as the day progresses, and the whispers of a west-southwest wind, playful and brisk at times, weave through the streets, urging the scattered clouds to dance ever so slightly. While the promise of a clear sky beckons warmth and light, a subtle curtain of haze hints at the remnants of the classic San Francisco marine layer, perhaps lingering stubbornly near the coast but yielding to the day\u2019s warmth.\n\nAs the sun traces its arc overhead, it paints a picture not just of a pleasant day but of serene potential. A light sweater or a light jacket will serve well against the afternoon coolness, especially if you're meandering along the more exposed corners of the city. With the day still young, consider a leisurely stroll through one of the neighborhood parks, where the sun filtering through the trees grants a tranquil retreat, or perhaps sip coffee at a local caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating, soaking in the ambiance of another beautiful day in the Bay. As the day shifts toward evening, the clouds will begin to gather, transforming from gentle puffs to a more blanket-like cover, declaring the night's arrival with whispers of the cool breeze returning.",
