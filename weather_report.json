    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the spirit of Independence Day unfurls beneath a brilliant blue sky, casting a warm embrace over the city. With temperatures hovering around a pleasant 62 degrees, the day is brightened further by westward winds that dance through the streets at 23 mph, offering a refreshing whisper that masks the day\u2019s briskness. As the afternoon approaches, the tranquility of the weather turns soothing; the cityscape reveals itself clear and inviting, providing a stunning backdrop of the Golden Gate, framed against a cloudless horizon.\n\nTonight, the skies promise a peaceful retreat, with conditions remaining mostly clear and a gentle descent to the low 50s. Yet, one should not forget the customary San Francisco chill\u2014layers are recommended, perhaps a lightweight jacket to fend off the evening winds that might linger beyond sunset. This is the moment to enjoy a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the gentle rhythm of the bay mingles with laughter and camaraderie, a fitting way to celebrate a summer\u2019s eve in the heart of a city vibrant with life.",
