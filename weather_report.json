    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the overnight air carries a humidity that whispers of the night\u2019s embrace, cloaked in a gentle testament of clouds. The mercury rests near 50, mingling with a light southwest breeze that flutters through the streets, barely more than a murmur. As dawn breaks, the sun begins its ascent, promising a day kissed by clarity, likely to unfold into mostly sunny skies and a high that nudges close to the mid-60s. Yet, as is the Bay\u2019s tradition, a subtle descent in temperature might drift in as the afternoon advances.\n\nGiven this delicate palette, expect a moderate wrap of light layers to best navigate the day\u2014perhaps a soft sweater and a light jacket to ward off the coolness that lingers, especially near the water. With the marine layer likely retreating back to its oceanic home, the ethereal dance of fog is expected to be minimal today. This gentle transformation invites a serene stroll along the waterfront, a quiet visit to an art gallery, or a gathering with friends over coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9. The day calls for enjoying the soothing rhythm of urban life, providing a perfect backdrop to appreciate the nuances of our vibrant city.",
