    "weather_report": "Tonight, the skies over Downtown San Francisco will be mostly clear, a canvas painted in varying shades of twilight blue, with hints of warmth as the day gives way to the night. The gentle wind from the west southwest may bring a refreshing chill, underscoring the necessity for a light jacket as temperatures dip to around 50. \n\nAs dawn breaks on Wednesday, the promise of a sunny day unfolds, hinting at the warmth to come. With a high nearing 64, the day invites you to step outdoors and savor the crisp air. The marine layer, while noticeably absent at dusk, could hover near the coast, creating that iconic San Francisco texture, softening the edges of the skyline without completely veiling its charms. Ideal for a stroll through the quieter streets, perhaps indulging in a warm beverage from a cozy caf\u00e9, or enjoying the company of a good book in one of the city's peaceful parks, the day appears to be vibrant and promising. So, grab a light sweater for the evening and an extra layer for tomorrow\u2019s mild breeze as you prepare to enjoy all that San Francisco has to offer on a delightful spring day.",
