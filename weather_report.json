    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon has ushered in bright sunshine, inviting all who venture outside to enjoy the day. There\u2019s a brisk west-southwest wind that dances through the city, adding a refreshing edge to the warm rays, making it feel pleasantly mild. The sky remains mostly clear, with only traces of fog reminiscent of the city\u2019s typical marine layer that may linger near the coastline, but the city itself basks in clarity with the Golden Gate Bridge standing proud against the blue backdrop. As dusk approaches, the temperature will dip softly, settling around a serene 58 degrees, still comfortable for evening strolls or cozy gatherings.\n\nGiven the warmth of the afternoon and the gentle evening breeze that follows, a light jacket will suffice as the perfect companion for your evening plans, whether that involves a casual walk along the boulevard or a relaxed dinner at an outdoor caf\u00e9. There\u2019s something sublime about the city under the stars, with local spots humming softly and the slight scent of the bay in the air. Consider venturing out to explore neighborhood parks or perhaps indulge in a tranquil evening at your favorite bookshop, embracing the night with a warm drink.",
