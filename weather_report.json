    "weather_report": "As dusk descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a soft blanket of clouds drapes the city, promising the faint whisper of rain later tonight. The air holds a mild chill, around the mid-fifties, while a gentle southwest breeze lightly rustles the leaves, underscoring the delicate transition from day to night. Shadows stretch across the streets, as the dimly glowing lights of the city reveal a landscape poised between the awakening of evening and the lingering remnants of daylight. The probability of rain, though understated, lingers in the atmosphere like an uninvited guest, with only a 20% chance of playful droplets making their entrance, hinting at potential but not definitive outcomes.\n\nAs tomorrow unfolds, a slight chance of rain lingers until late morning, encouraging those setting out early to don a light jacket or perhaps an umbrella, just in case. The clouds are set to persist, veiling the sun\u2019s rays and keeping daytime temperatures close to the low sixties, gradually retreating to the cooler embrace of the late afternoon. The marine layer, while gentle, does hint at a foggy embrace, particularly near the coastline, swirling around the Golden Gate Bridge yet leaving the heart of the city relatively clear. A stroll through the nearby parks or along the waterfront might be a refreshing choice, as the cool breeze encourages an evening\u2019s exploration of local caf\u00e9s or art galleries, embracing the ambience of a fog-kissed San Francisco night.",
