    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, an ethereal calm hangs in the air, marked by the soft rustle of the wind at 13 mph. The city wakes partly shrouded in clouds, their delicate wisps creating a reflective blanket that momentarily hushes the skyline. The early morning low settles around a gentle 52 degrees, inviting a cozy layering; a light jacket tossed over a shirt would be wise for those stepping out into the brisk embrace of the day. \n\nAs the sun ascends, anticipation builds for a clearer horizon. By late morning, the sunshine will intensify, promising a high of around 62 degrees, before gently cooling to a comfortable 60 by the afternoon. The day from this vantage will likely unfold with pleasant clarity, though it\u2019s well to keep an eye on those vestiges of fog that cling playfully to the coast. The marine layer wraps around the Golden Gate, ensuring that a sprinkle of chill may linger even under the bright sun. Today presents an ideal backdrop for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero, perhaps indulging in a quiet moment at one of the waterfront caf\u00e9s, with a good book in hand and the gentle lapping of waves providing a soundtrack to your thoughts.",
