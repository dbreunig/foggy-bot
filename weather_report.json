    "weather_report": "In the early hours of Tuesday, Downtown San Francisco awakens subtly under a partly cloudy sky, enveloped in a tranquil chill that promises the stillness of the night lingers just a while longer. The streets breathe softly beneath the low hum of the west southwest wind, carrying hints of a clearer morning yet to unfold. As the day breaks, the sun will elevate its presence, revealing a crisp and sunny canvas, with temperatures gracefully rising to a pleasant high while gradually settling into a soothing coolness by the afternoon.\n\nThe visibility today looks remarkably clear, hinting at a respite from the fog that often greets San Francisco in its characteristic dance with the ocean. The delicate embrace of marine air might still linger over the bay, subtly softening the edges of the iconic Golden Gate, but for now, it seems an inviting day to venture outside. One might don a light jacket over casual layers, perfect for the slightly brisk morning and the gentle breeze that accompanies the day. With temperatures falling slightly as the sun arcs overhead, it\u2019s the ideal moment for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping to sip coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 or finding a tucked-away corner to enjoy the unfolding day. In the embrace of early spring, the city invites exploring its quieter paths, where the joyful whispers of a waking metropolis weave through the air.",
