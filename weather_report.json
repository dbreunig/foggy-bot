    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a soft layer of clouds drapes over the skyline, holding the warmth of the day like a gentle embrace. With temperatures settling around a comfortable 60 degrees, the breeze whispers through the streets, occasionally stirring leaves and tousling hair. The west wind, persistent yet light, carries with it a hint of sea air, reminding all of the day's proximity to the ocean's edge.\n\nTomorrow promises to greet the citizens with a mixture of sunshine and clouds, inviting them outdoors. The anticipated highs in the upper sixties forecast a delightful day for leisurely walks along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to the bustling marketplaces, where one can savor seasonal fruits under playful beams of sunlight. As fog teases the edges of the bay, any lingering marine layer should retreat, yielding to the clear skies that often grace the Golden Gate and beyond. Dressing in light layers will provide comfort against the cool winds of the evening while allowing for easy adjustment to the warmth of the midday sun. Perhaps an invigorating stroll through Golden Gate Park or a quiet moment spent in a caf\u00e9, watching the world drift by, would be the perfect response to these ever-so enchanting San Francisco conditions.",
