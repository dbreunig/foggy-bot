    "weather_report": "As night draws near in Downtown San Francisco, the skies are partly cloudy, lending a serene quality to the evening. The temperature dips to a mild 52 degrees, accompanied by a gentle west wind that whistles at 10 to 17 mph, occasionally picking up gusts that dance through the city's narrow streets. The soft murmur of the wind carries hints of the Pacific, while patches of fog flirt along the edges of the bay, reminiscent of whispered secrets cloaked in mist.\n\nTomorrow promises a more cheerful disposition, as the sun is expected to break forth with a mostly sunny embrace, warming the day to approximately 61 degrees. The wind, too, will rise, blowing steadily at 16 to 26 mph. This dynamic shift calls for attire that balances warmth and comfort\u2014think a light jacket over breathable layers, perfect for a stroll along the waterfront or an afternoon in one of the city's renowned parks. As you venture out, perhaps take a moment to savor an artisanal coffee or explore a hidden gem of a bookstore, enveloped by San Francisco's unique charm, while the clouds above part to grant a glimpse of blue.",
