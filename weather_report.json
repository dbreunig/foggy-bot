    "weather_report": "A gentle hush envelops Downtown San Francisco this morning. The air carries a mild chill, wisps of fog threading through the cityscape, especially nearing the Golden Gate Bridge, hinting at the encroaching marine layer that often dances between land and sea. The sun, albeit partially victorious, bathes the city in a soft glow, struggling against scattered clouds that shift languidly across the sky. Highs today are tipped at around 62, a reminder that even in summer, the winds from the west-southwest soothe rather than scorch, refreshing as they pick up strength to flirt with gusts of 21 mph.\n\nAs dusk approaches, clouds will deepen, cloaking the city in a more subdued embrace. With the evening\u2019s low hovering around 56, layering becomes essential. Consider a light sweater or a stylish jacket that can fend off the cooling breezes, perfect for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or a reflective moment at one of the cozy caf\u00e9s, perhaps savoring a warm drink while watching the world drift by. With a blend of warmth and coolness, today feels like an invitation to engage with the city\u2019s quieter corners\u2014the hidden parks or muraled alleys waiting to be explored as the city meanders through its day.",
