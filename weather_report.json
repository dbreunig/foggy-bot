    "weather_report": "The dawn brings a whisper of coolness to Downtown San Francisco, where the air holds the slightest hint of drizzle as it drifts gently over the city. The clouds are mostly clear, allowing just fragments of the approaching day to seep through, with the temperature hovering around a comfortable sixty degrees. A light west wind makes its presence known, skimming across the hills and adding an invigorating edge to the morning. As the sun rises, the promise of a sunny afternoon begins to unfold, offering a high near seventy-two before the gentle descent into the evening. \n\nThe day ahead holds a delicate beauty, with only a slight chance of drizzle lingering until late morning. The fog, a faithful companion to San Francisco, may be shy today but has kept its distance, clearing slowly from the expanse of the bay by afternoon. Dress in layers; a light jacket in hues of soft gray or ocean blue will keep you comfortably warm during the cool morning hours but can be shed as the sun reaches its gentle peak. It is a fine day for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps engaging in a cafe\u2019s warmth with a warm cup, or savoring views of the iconic bridge as it gracefully emerges from its misty veil. A quiet moment in a park, or simply meandering through the neighborhoods, could reveal the vibrant energy of the city waking up, creating a rare harmony of calm and community.",
