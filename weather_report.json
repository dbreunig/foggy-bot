    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco brings a peaceful clarity, as the sky clears to reveal a backdrop of stars with a gentle chill settling in, temperatures dipping to around 50 degrees. The southwest wind whispers softly, carrying with it the promise of another bright day ahead. As we look toward tomorrow, expect the sun to grace us with its presence, bathing the city in warmth with a high near 60. But, as the afternoon unfolds, a slight coolness will accompany the falling temperatures, making a cozy sweater or light jacket a smart choice for your afternoon outings.\n\nConsidering the current conditions and pleasant forecast, the evening is ripe for a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero. Perhaps stop for a warm beverage at one of the charming cafes dotting the waterfront, where the city\u2019s vibrant energy feels almost tangible, yet comfortably distant. As the night tips into its quieter hours, those seeking a bit of peace might indulge in a well-loved book, with the gentle hum of the San Francisco night wrapping around them like a soft blanket. The fog may come and go, but tonight, it takes a break, leaving room for the stars to shine and the city to breathe freely.",
