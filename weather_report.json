    "weather_report": "Tonight, as the sun drifts away, there's a faint whisper of rain in the air\u2014a slight chance of showers or perhaps a rumble of thunder that dances between 7 and 9 PM. The sky unveils a mostly clear canvas, but cool breezes from the northwest, gusting up to 28 mph, remind us that San Francisco evenings can bite, especially as the temperature dips to a crisp 46 degrees. A 20% chance of precipitation hangs, hinting at a playfulness in the weather.\n\nTomorrow promises a return of sunshine, with the day brightening up to a gentle high near 59. As the afternoon sets in, temperatures will modestly retreat to around 57, yet the invigorating winds will continue to embrace the city, keeping the atmosphere refreshingly brisk. Given the current transitional skies and the lingering chance of moisture, it's advisable to dress in layers. A light jacket will shield you from the evening chill, while perhaps a long-sleeve shirt will serve well during the warmer daytime hours. Considering the prevailing weather, a leisurely evening stroll through the quieter streets or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 may offer the perfect escape from the urban bustle, providing a cozy atmosphere to unwind as the city glimmers under the fading light.",
