    "weather_report": "In the heart of downtown San Francisco, a gentle embrace of morning light offers a tranquil start to the day. Currently, the sky reveals itself as mostly sunny, with the sun casting an inviting glow that hints at a high of 64 degrees, soon tapering off to a pleasantly cool 62 as the afternoon unfolds. The breeze, a steady west-southwest wind, dances through the streets at around 13 to 25 mph, adding a refreshing edge to the warmth clinging to the pavement.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent, a veil of clouds will weave into the fabric of the evening sky, leading to a low of about 54. The wind will not relent, stirring softly as dusk approaches, ensuring that a jacket or light layer will be a perfect companion for those winding down, perhaps with a leisurely walk along the waterfront or a cozy gathering at a local caf\u00e9. While the cityscape offers clarity in the distance, traces of the marine layer cling to the Bay, promising a night layered in mystery yet devoid of heavy fog. Embrace this splendid day with simplicity\u2014stroll the charming streets, savor a warm beverage, and bask in the soft warmth that San Francisco graciously bestows.",
