    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a mostly sunny sky that invites a gentle warmth. However, a brisk breeze from the west southwest serves as a reminder of the city\u2019s coastal temperament. As the sun climbs higher, temperatures will peak around 64 before settling into a cooler afternoon at approximately 62, complemented by wind gusts that could reach 32 mph. The initial clarity of the day gives way to a patchwork of clouds; the evening promises more overcast as night falls, with temperatures dipping to around 54, ensuring that a light jacket remains a wise companion throughout.\n\nGiven the shifting landscape of fog and sunshine, attire that balances between comfort and practicality is ideal. A lightweight sweater, paired with jeans and sturdy shoes, allows for easy movement and adaptation to the changing elements. For those seeking respite in the outdoors, a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero could be a delightful choice, while those who prefer indoor pursuits might find solace in one of the many cozy caf\u00e9s sprinkled throughout the city, sipping hot beverages as they watch the world pass by. Today reflects the essence of San Francisco, where the charm of unpredictability meets the thrill of an undoubtedly pleasant summer day.",
