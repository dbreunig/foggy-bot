    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the sun rises in vivid splendor, dispelling the lingering shadows of night with a brilliant display of light that dances across the skyline. The day promises to be sunny, with temperatures expected to hover near the mid-60s, dipping slightly as the afternoon wears on. A brisk west wind sweeps through the streets, carrying with it a freshness that invigorates the spirit. The winds, at times fierce with gusts near 31 mph, lend an exhilarating touch to the air, perfect for those who appreciate a bit of movement in their surroundings. \n\nAs the morning unfolds, the clarity of the atmosphere reveals itself; however, remnants of the marine layer cling close to the coast, softly veiling the Golden Gate in a light embrace. While the horizon appears bold and bright, there may be pockets of fog swirling about the bay, a gentle reminder of the ocean's breath that shapes this coastal haven. With the temperature cooling in the evening, a light jacket will suffice as the night ushers in a peaceful calm, with clear skies settling into the landscape. Today beckons outdoor pursuits \u2014 perhaps a stroll through one of the city's many parks or a thoughtful visit to a local caf\u00e9, where good company and warm coffee await.",
