    "weather_report": "As the city gently stirs from its slumber, a veil of clouds blankets the early morning hours, wrapping everything in a cozy gray. The cool air, whispering through the trees, promises a low of about 52 degrees, a typical embrace for San Francisco's nocturnal hours. As the sun ascends, silvery tendrils of fog cling lightly to the shoreline and are shyly dotted around the Golden Gate, creating a soft unison of earth and sky that defines this bustling coastal gem.\n\nBy midday, the clouds will yield to moments of warmth as the sun struggles to break through, ushering in a canvas of partially sunny skies. Temperatures are expected to rise, touching the mellow heights of around 60 degrees, while a westerly breeze dances through the iconic streets, playfully ruffling the edges of light jackets and sweaters. The occasional gust, hinting at the ocean's breath, will remind you of the unique blend of sea air, where fog meets city life. \n\nFor those heading outdoors, opting for layers will be wise. A light jacket or cardigan can invite comfort against the chill of the lingering breeze, while scarves may provide a dash of coziness as one strolls through vibrant neighborhoods or parks. Consider visiting local cafes, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee can brighten any disposition, or perhaps wander along the Embarcadero, where the sights and sounds of the bay invite reflection. For the more adventurous, a picnic at Crissy Field could revel in those brief moments when the sun spills warmth, creating a perfect backdrop for leisure under the attentive gaze of the swaying palms.",
