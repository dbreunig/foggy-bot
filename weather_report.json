    "weather_report": "As downtown San Francisco begins to stir, the atmosphere carries a muted restlessness. Overnight clouds enveloped the city in a soft embrace, with a low temperature hovering around a comfortable 51 degrees. The gentle south wind, barely brushing the skin, hints at the day's eventual transition. \n\nCome Tuesday morning, a veil of patchy fog looms, suggesting a tranquil yet slightly obscure ambiance. Expect rain to make its leisurely entrance, draping the city in a gray shroud\u2014cloudy skies will dominate the horizon, and the high will only climb to a modest 59 degrees, gradually retreating to 57 by afternoon. The chance of precipitation, around 60%, whispers tales of the dampness that might wash over streets and rooftops. \n\nAmid this atmospheric dance, the city appears more subdued than picturesque, with the fog marking its presence along the edges of the view while the iconic landmarks lurk behind soft edges. This is not a day for shorts and bright colors; instead, consider layering up with a light waterproof jacket and comfortable shoes, perfect for navigating the slick streets. As the weather weaves through its narrative, why not embrace the randomness of the day? Find a quiet caf\u00e9 and lose yourself in a book, or take a solitary stroll along the waterfront, where the rain's rhythm can be a balm for restless thoughts.",
