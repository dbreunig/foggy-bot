    "weather_report": "As night drapes itself across Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a gentle whisper of warmth, settling into a soft blanket of partly cloudy skies with temperatures lingering around a cool 56 degrees. With winds lightly brushing from the southwest, a serene tranquility envelops the city, inviting you to pause, breathe deeply, and soak in the subtle glow of street lamps casting golden flecks against the darkened pavements.\n\nCome morning, the forecast reveals its cheerful promise of mostly sunny skies, beckoning you to step outside and embrace the invigorating daylight. As you wander through the city, you'll notice the temperature rising to a pleasant 68 degrees, sweetly tempered by occasional gusts, playful and fresh, stretching upwards to 16 mph. However, as the afternoon unfolds, it will gently dip back towards 62, urging you to bring along a light sweater or a casual jacket for the latter part of your day.\n\nThis delightful blend of sun and soft winds creates an inviting atmosphere for enjoying a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the enchanting parks that dot the neighborhoods. Perhaps you'll find joy in sipping coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, the light breeze ruffling the pages of your book, or rediscovering the hidden gems of local shops as the city awakens in its golden embrace.",
