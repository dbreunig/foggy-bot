    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds with a gentle warmth, the sun breaking through with a promise of clarity that lingers in the air. As the afternoon unfolds, temperatures hover in the low sixties, kissed by a light west-southwest breeze that adds a delightful touch to the atmosphere. The streets, bathed in a bright yet soft sunlight, invite a sense of ease and relaxation, tempered only by the occasional push of marine air. \n\nAs evening approaches, a subtle shift is in store. The forecast hints at a light drizzle creeping in after two, punctuated by a blanket of clouds that will begin to gather. While the chance of rain is light, it may be just enough to encourage a cozy attire for those planning to venture out later. A light jacket or a sweater should suffice, giving comfort against the cool evenings that embrace the city. There\u2019s something to be said for this kind of weather; it offers an ideal backdrop for a simple evening stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps a quiet visit to a caf\u00e9, where you can sip a warm drink while watching the day softly surrender to night.",
