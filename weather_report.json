    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the day unveils itself under a crystal-clear sky, a sharp contrast to the usual marine fog that often drapes the city in mystery. With the sun poised to hover around a mild 62 degrees, the air carries a gentle warmth that promises a pleasant day ahead. The brisk West wind, dancing at speeds of up to 24 mph, adds a refreshing touch, rustling leaves and encouraging a wholesome stroll along the Embarcadero or through the arboretum at Golden Gate Park.\n\nTonight, as twilight descends, the air will cool to a comfortable 52 degrees, ideal for evening outings. With the skies remaining mostly clear, it would be wise to don layers, perhaps a light jacket to fend off the evening chill as you enjoy a quiet dinner at one of San Francisco's many cozy eateries or partake in a leisurely walk along the waterfront. The beauty of this day lies not just in its clarity but in the opportunity it presents for simple pleasures\u2014an unhurried caf\u00e9 visit, the rustling of pages in a favorite book, or perhaps a quiet moment watching the sun dip behind the skyline.",
