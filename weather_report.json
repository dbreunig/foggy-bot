    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Downtown San Francisco, clouds gather in a cozy embrace, framing the skyline with a hint of mystery. The cool, moist air whispers of impending rain, where a chance of showers looms like a gentle specter. With temperatures dipping to around 46 degrees, it\u2019s prudent to bundle up against the brisk west-northwest winds rustling through the streets. The city's ambiance is softened by the low cloud cover, evoking an ethereal charm that beckons for a warm cup of tea or a snug corner in a local caf\u00e9, perhaps nestled amidst the flickering lights and soft music.\n\nFor those venturing out tomorrow, expect pockets of sun breaking through the clouds, accompanied by a lingering chance of early showers. The day promises coolness with temperatures climbing to a modest 56, revealing just enough light for a pleasant stroll or a leisurely chat in Civic Center Plaza. As the marine layer dances at the edges of the Golden Gate, you might catch glimpses of fog rolling in and out, softening the horizon's lines. Dressing in layers will serve you well\u2014consider a light jacket for the chill and perhaps a scarf to ward off the coastal breeze. Whether wandering through the vibrant streets or exploring the nearby parks, the allure of San Francisco remains undiminished, inviting you to embrace the quiet beauty of the city, even on a cloudy day.",
