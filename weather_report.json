    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in a gentle embrace of sunshine, where the warmth of the sun begins to challenge the lingering coolness of the marine layer. The air sways lightly with a whisper of wind from the west, carrying with it a hint of coastal salt and adventure. The iconic Golden Gate Bridge stands proud in the distance, partly veiled in its usual shroud of softness, yet the clarity today reveals a canvas of blue that invites exploration. The forecast hints at a high near sixty-five, suggesting that the day promises pleasant warmth, especially for those willing to trade a heavy coat for a light sweater or a resilient long-sleeve shirt.\n\nWith the surrounding hills keeping watch, this afternoon is ideal for venturing onto the city\u2019s many walking paths. Strolling along the Embarcadero or browsing through the open-air stalls at the Ferry Building Marketplace seems particularly inviting. As the sunlight dances upon the bay, the occasional gusts serve as a gentle reminder of the nature woven into this urban tapestry. Comfortable footwear for a leisurely walk and a light jacket for the evening\u2019s dip in temperature will complement today's leisurely pursuits. This is San Francisco, after all\u2014where the weather tells stories as rich as the culture that defines it.",
