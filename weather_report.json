    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over Downtown San Francisco, a crisp morning greets the skyline, the city and its iconic structures bathed in a soft light that hints at the warmth to come. Today is set to be mostly sunny, with temperatures reaching a comfortable 67 degrees. The west-southwest winds, brisk and fresh, dance around at 14 to 21 mph, causing the gentle waves of the bay to shimmer playfully. The air carries a refreshing coolness, suggesting a pleasant day ahead, although the embrace of a marine layer lingers in the outskirts, teasing the edges of visibility, particularly near the Golden Gate.\n\nAs the day unfolds, it promises clarity, perfect for quiet strolls along the waterfront or perhaps sitting at a caf\u00e9, watching the world indulge in the morning bustle. Light layers are a wise choice; a light sweater or jacket will guard against the chill from the winds that swirl through the streets, especially as the city cools in the evening. Activities such as exploring the hidden alleyways filled with street art and small galleries, or taking a leisurely walk through the Presidio, will be most satisfying. Today offers a canvas of pleasant weather, inviting exploration and serene encounters with nature\u2019s beauty interwoven with urban life.",
