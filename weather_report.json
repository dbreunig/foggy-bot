    "weather_report": "The night drapes Downtown San Francisco in a soft layer of cloud, a veil that softens the edges of the cityscape and adds a touch of mystery to its familiar landmarks. The gentle north wind carries whispers of the ocean, keeping the air cool, with temperatures settling into the low 40s, a reminder that the bay is always close at hand. As dawn approaches, the promise of a partly sunny day unfolds, hinting that warm hues might peek through the cloud cover. By midday, temperatures will find their stride near the low 60s, offering a serene atmosphere punctuated by the occasional caress of a light breeze.\n\nThough the golden light of the sun may break through, the marine layer could persist along the coast, shrouding the iconic Golden Gate in its embrace. Yet, for those wandering the vibrant streets, this is merely part of the charm that defines the city. It is the perfect time for a leisurely stroll through the parks or a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh pastry mingles with the anticipation of a crisp day ahead. Layering a light jacket over a comfortable sweater would be wise, allowing one to savor the fresh air without succumbing to the chill. Engaging in the serene rhythms of urban life, be it a tranquil read on a park bench or a casual conversation with a stranger, seems especially inviting in these conditions.",
