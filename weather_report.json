    "weather_report": "The afternoon light drapes itself across Downtown San Francisco, weaving a tapestry of muted gray and soft blues beneath a blanket of mostly cloudy skies. The air is alive with a brisk, westward wind, whispering at sixteen miles per hour, occasionally stirring with gusts that reach for the high twenties. It's a day where the chill lingers, with temperatures gracefully settling around 55 degrees, making the atmosphere feel almost contemplative\u2014a perfect companion for a quiet stroll or reflective moment.\n\nAs evening blankets the city, the clouds will hold firm, and the temperature will soften to around 50 degrees. The marine layer dances at the edges of visibility, hinting at the fog\u2019s eventual embrace. In this seaside metropolis, it's wise to layer up, opting for a light jacket perhaps, paired with a scarf to fend off the evening\u2019s cool breath. The outdoor caf\u00e9 seats invite the brave souls seeking a warm cup of coffee, while the nearby trails beckon for gentle trekking with friends or loved ones, away from the bustling city heart. It\u2019s a lovely afternoon to indulge in simple pleasures, savoring the outdoor air while staying warmly ensconced in comfort.",
