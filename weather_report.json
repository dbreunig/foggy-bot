    "weather_report": "As the early morning settles over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of cloudiness drapes the city, hinting at a lingering marine layer that may be reluctant to fully lift. The stillness of the air carries a sense of anticipation, with temperatures resting at a gentle 56 degrees. Occasional drizzle may tiptoe through the streets, but it remains merely a whisper, with a mere 20% chance for any substantial moisture. The breeze from the southwest carries a coolness, a reminder of the bay's embrace, making it wise to don a light jacket, perhaps in soft gray or muted blue, to combat the chill.\n\nAs the day progresses, we can expect a slow transition into a partly sunny canvas, with temperatures nudging up to 63 degrees before retreating to a softer 61 in the afternoon. Spare moments might find you savoring a quiet walk along the waterfront, or perhaps renting a bicycle to explore the less-traveled nooks of the city. Seek comfort in a cozy caf\u00e9, where the warmth of a freshly brewed coffee can inspire reflections amidst the dance of clouds. It\u2019s a day that promises brief glimpses of sunlight but whispers of the cool embrace that the coastal fog generously shares with this remarkable city.",
