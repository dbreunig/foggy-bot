    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle embrace of sunlight, casting its moderate warmth against the familiar contours of the city. With a high nearing sixty-three degrees, the air carries an invigorating west-southwest breeze that swirls around at a spirited pace, invigorating those out and about. Yet, as the daylight gracefully cedes to the evening, a slight chance of drizzle lurks on the horizon, whispering of moisture to come post-11 PM, accompanied by a low settling around fifty-six.\n\nThe clarity of the day presents a mixed palette\u2014while the sun shines, the undercurrents of fog threaten to curl at the edges, hinting at the marine layer that often graces this storied city. Dressing in layers becomes a prudent choice; a light jacket is recommended for the evening's coolness, while a simple shirt or blouse enjoys the sun\u2019s approval by day. Consider perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or sipping a comforting cup of coffee in one of the cozy cafes that dot the streets. In this gilded moment between clouds and sunlight, the heart of San Francisco pulses softly, inviting all to appreciate its subtle beauty.",
