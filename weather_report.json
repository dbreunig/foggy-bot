    "weather_report": "As the clock moves past the evening threshold in Downtown San Francisco, a serene clarity envelops the city. The night sky, mostly devoid of clouds, casts a gentle warmth reminiscent of summer's embrace, with temperatures dipping to a comfortable 54 degrees. A light southwest breeze carries the scent of the bay, whispering tales of past evenings while keeping the air refreshingly crisp. The absence of fog this evening invites the stars to shine with a subtle brilliance, hinting at the beauty that awaits the dawn.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the promise of sunshine fills the horizon. A high of around 70 degrees beckons, heralding a day of warmth embraced by fresh breezes that dance through the streets. As the sun ascends, its rays will illuminate the cityscape, enhancing the vibrancy of the various hues that paint the neighborhoods. With such weather on the horizon, one might stroll through the parks, visit intimate caf\u00e9s for a quiet morning coffee, or take a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the water's edge meets the twinkling city lights. Dress lightly, donning layers that can be shed in the afternoon warmth, for the day invites outdoor comfortable attire, ensuring a seamless transition from the cool morning to the sunlit afternoon.",
