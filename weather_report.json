The southwest wind whispers through the city, a gentle reminder of the coast lurking nearby. As dawn breaks, the skyline stirs; the promise of a mostly sunny day begins to unfold. The anticipated high of 64 will see temperatures tiptoeing down to a cooler 62 by afternoon, couched beneath a blissful sky, edged by a light breeze that may accentuate the chill just enough to linger in our bones.\n\nThe marine layer may still cling to the outskirts, but the city will begin to shake off its weight as the sun makes its playful debut. Those venturing out today might find joy in donning layers\u2014a soft sweater or a light jacket for the early moments, transitioning to a simple tee or a breezy blouse as the sun stretches its arms overhead. These conditions weave an inviting tapestry for a leisurely stroll through the streets, perhaps indulging in a quiet caf\u00e9 moment or meandering along the waterfront where the Pacific\u2019s whisper harmonizes with the city\u2019s heartbeat. It is a day where the charm of San Francisco unfolds gently, urging us to take a breath, savor every detail, and find pleasure in the ordinary.",
