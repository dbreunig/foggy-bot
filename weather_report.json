    "weather_report": "Tonight, the city breathes under a blanket of clouds, a soft veil that hints at the possibility of rain after the hour of dawn. The air is brisk, with a gentle wind whispering from the west-southwest, reminding us of the ocean's proximity, a cool companion in the evening's embrace. Current temperatures hover around a mild 49 degrees, perfect for layering\u2014a light jacket will serve well against the chill, especially with the increasing threat of precipitation. \n\nAs we turn to Tuesday, the forecast reveals a continuation of the cloud-covered sky, as the sun prepares to retreat, with temperatures peaking at a cool 57 before softly falling to 55. The city's silhouette will rest against a backdrop that feels moody yet alluring; the likelihood of rain rises to 50%, coupled with the faint promise of droplets, perhaps less than a whisper upon the pavement. It's an ideal day for a quiet stroll through the heart of the city, perhaps pausing at a cozy caf\u00e9 where warmth and comfort invite you to linger. Embrace the gentle melancholy of the season\u2014whether it\u2019s reading a novel, catching up with a friend, or simply daydreaming in a corner as the world drizzles quietly outside.",
