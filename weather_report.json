    "weather_report": "As the city of San Francisco sleeps beneath a blanket of scattered clouds, the air is cool, invigorated by a west wind that whispers through the night. With temperatures resting at a mild 53 degrees, the scene is set for a day awash with sunshine, although the charm of the iconic fog is never too far away. As the sun ascends, a bright warmth is destined to replace the coolness\u2014a glorious Independence Day showcasing a lofty high around 62. Yet, later in the day, as the horizon bends toward evening, we can expect temperatures to gently retreat to a pleasant 60 degrees, enveloping the city in a light, soothing embrace.\n\nTomorrow\u2019s whispers of wind will be felt prominently, gusting to nearly 35 mph, and those venturing out would do well to don layers, perhaps a light jacket or sweater, to complement their favorite summer attire amid the breezy conditions. Today holds an invitation to stroll amongst the city\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods or to partake in a leisurely picnic in one of its lush parks, where friends and families can gather and celebrate. The clarity of the day, however bright, may yield to hints of that familiar marine layer drifting in, softly reminding us of the ever-present dance between sun and fog that defines this remarkable coast.",
