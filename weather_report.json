    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a golden embrace as the sun reigns supreme, casting a warm glow across the city's iconic vistas. The air is brisk, invigorated by a steady westward wind that dances at 23 mph, cuts through the balmy atmosphere, and encourages residents to embrace the day. Clarity reigns, with no hint of the fog that often lingers in the undercurrents of the Bay; instead, the horizon is refreshingly clear, revealing the distant outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge etched against a canvas of blue.\n\nAs the sun dips lower and night beckons, the sky will transform into a serene tapestry of twilight hues, accompanied by gentle breezes cooling the warmth of the day. With the evening temperature settling around 54 degrees, plans might meander towards the comfort of a relaxed caf\u00e9, where the lingering summer light can be savored over a warm drink. This weather invites layers: a light jacket or cardigan will suit perfectly, creating a balance between comfort and style. A stroll along the waterfront or an evening gathering with friends in a cozy outdoor setting will be met with delightful satisfaction in this enchanting urban landscape.",
