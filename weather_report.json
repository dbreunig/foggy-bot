    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the city appears draped in a cool blanket of gray mist, hinting at the familiar chill of the marine layer. The air feels comfortable against the skin, with a gentle west-southwest breeze teasing the strands of hair that escape your hat or hood. Today reveals itself as a dance between the cloudy remnants of the night and the promise of sunny breaks that the forecast teases. The temperature will rise gently, inviting a shift from the nighttime's cooler embrace into the afternoon\u2019s warmth, where the sun, when it does peek out, will illuminate the streets with a soft glow.\n\nDress in layers today\u2014perhaps a light jacket or a cozy sweater to keep the chill at bay during your morning coffee ritual, and think about tucking a short-sleeved shirt underneath for the afternoon when the warmth begins to seep into the atmosphere. As you wander through the city, perhaps take the opportunity to visit a favorite bookstore or let the misty air escort you to one of the quaint coffee shops nestled on a quiet corner. The subdued light offers an artistic quality to your surroundings; it\u2019s the perfect backdrop for reflective moments or intimate conversations. Keep an eye out for the sun breaking through, and let the day guide your small adventures in this beautiful urban tapestry.",
