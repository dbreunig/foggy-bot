The air, currently cool and crisp, carries a whisper of the sea's breath, hinting at the day\u2019s expected transition into mild sunshine. A subtle breeze drifts through the city, at times bringing a refreshing sensation, at others barely a whisper, making it a perfect evening for a leisurely stroll.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the forecast promises a delightful scene, with mostly sunny skies emerging to grace the city. A high near 66 beckons, with temperatures slightly dipping in the afternoon\u2014an invitation to layer up for comfort. The persistent presence of the marine layer hints at the fog\u2019s playful departure, likely retreating to blanket the coast rather than disrupt the day\u2019s clarity. For those venturing outdoors, a light jacket or sweater would be wise, enhancing the enjoyment of a round of casual art gallery hopping or perhaps a visit to your favorite caf\u00e9, where a warm beverage might be the ideal companion. As the clock ticks toward morning, the city awaits with the potential for serene adventures, waiting for its inhabitants to emerge and savor the gentle shift of the seasons.",
