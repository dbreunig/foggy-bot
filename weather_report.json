    "weather_report": "As night descends over Downtown San Francisco, the city brims with a soft, muted vibrancy, under a veil of increasing clouds and the promise of a gentle drizzle. The temperatures are nudging downwards, resting at a comfortable midpoint where warmth and coolness mingle, inviting all to embrace the crispness of the evening air. With the wind whispering through the streets at a lively pace, it sways the trees and sends the scent of the bay floating through the inky sky.\n\nThough the sun has played its final act for the day, casting the horizon in delicate hues, the cloud cover hints at the return of the marine layer, which weaves its way through the evening, cloaking the surroundings in its gentle embrace. For those wandering outside, a light jacket or layered clothing is advisable; it\u2019s a day to revel in the beauty of the city's nooks and crannies, perhaps seeking solace in a cozy caf\u00e9 or indulging in a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the rhythmic crash of waves against the piers evokes a sense of serenity. \n\nAs the drizzle makes its debut, it provides a refreshing touch, a reminder of the city\u2019s maritime heart. Tonight is for quiet moments, warm cups, and the soft glow of streetlamps illuminating the delicate beauty of a San Francisco evening.",
