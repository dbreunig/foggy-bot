    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the city basks in intermittent sunshine as clouds drift lazily across the sky. With a hint of moisture lingering in the air, a slight chance of rain before five remains, yet the atmosphere feels mostly dry and pleasant, buoyed by a gentle west wind. The current temperature dances around a crisp sixty degrees, inviting layers that can adapt to the day\u2019s shifting conditions. As daylight wanes, the fog begins to creep in, heralding a transition that will undoubtedly transform the skyline by dawn, cloaking the familiar sights in a captivating shroud of mist.\n\nAs the evening approaches, expect patchy fog to emerge after four, a soft blanket that brings a touch of mystery to the familiar streets. With temperatures dipping to around forty-nine, a cozy jacket will serve you well against the evening chill. This is a fitting time for an exploratory stroll along the Embarcadero, a leisurely visit to your favorite caf\u00e9, or simply unwinding at home with a good book as the fog settles, blanketing the vibrant city in a calm embrace. Embrace the elements, for they add texture to the tapestry of daily life in this remarkable place.",
