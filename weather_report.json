A glimpse into the evening reveals the city shrouded in a subtle blanket of clouds, casting a soft glow as the remaining light dances off the rooftops. Although not overwhelmed by fog, the familiar hints of the marine layer waft gently along the edges of the streets, promising a cool refreshment as the warmer air settles in.\n\nTomorrow, San Francisco greets the dawn with assurance, shedding the night\u2019s chill for a day imbued with sunshine and light. On the horizon, the sun will rise bright and clear, a harbinger of a pleasantly warm afternoon where the temperature flirtatiously approaches the low seventies. With a gentle southwest breeze whispering through, it will be a day best enjoyed outdoors\u2014perhaps a stroll through the vibrant streets or a quiet moment in one of the many parks, where you may revel in the turquoise skies. Dressing in layers remains wise; a light jacket for the cool morning will soon give way to a more relaxed attire as the sun rises higher. Embrace the day ahead, for it holds the promise of warmth and the gentle kiss of a coastal breeze\u2014a perfect tableau for savoring the world outside your door.",
