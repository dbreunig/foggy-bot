    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is marked by a pleasant coolness, calling for a light jacket. The current conditions remain partly cloudy, as the low settles around 50 degrees. A brisk west wind dances through the streets, lending a breezy energy that complements the crisp evening air. The cityscape reveals hints of clarity, but there are whispers of fog hanging low along the edges of the bay, particularly around the Golden Gate, creating a soft veil over the water.\n\nTomorrow unfolds with the promise of sunshine, inviting the exploration of one\u2019s surroundings. As daylight breaks, a high near 60 degrees is expected, paired with a continued gentle breeze that lends encouragement to outdoor ventures. Dress in layers to savor the warmth of the sun while preparing for its playful temperament. A stroll through the quiet streets, perhaps leading to a cozy caf\u00e9, or a visit to one of the local parks to enjoy the serene vibes seems fitting given the conditions. Revel in the simple charm of San Francisco as it shifts from evening\u2019s embrace to the cheerful embrace of a sunny Friday.",
