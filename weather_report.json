    "weather_report": "As we gently transition into a new day in Downtown San Francisco, the air is a cool embrace, tinted with the lingering warmth of late spring. Overnight, the sky has donned a simple shroud of partly cloudiness, hovering near 53, while the winds whisper softly from the southwest, weaving through the streets like a muted tune. \n\nCome the breaking dawn, the sun will rise victoriously clear and bright, proclaiming a high near 72. The soft zephyrs will pick up strength, twirling around at 7 to 20 mph, stirring life into the day. Yet, it\u2019s a San Francisco morning, and the familiar marine layer remains just a breath away, wafting in from the Bay. As the sun ascends, it\u2019s likely the fog will dissipate from the more sheltered pockets of the city, leaving behind the clarity to admire the storied skyline and cascading hills.\n\nDress in layers to embrace the day fully \u2014 a light jacket for the briskness of the early hours, which you can shed as the warmth envelops you by noon. Given this refreshing tableau, a stroll along the Embarcadero would be a delightful choice, allowing you to savor a coffee while soaking in the sights of ferries gliding through the water and the distant outline of the Golden Gate emerging with the morning light. For those inclined to the more serene, a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9 or a leisurely read in one of the parks may offer a perfect balm, punctuated by the gentle rustle of leaves.",
