    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity envelops the city, painting a serene picture of the morning. The remnants of night recede, leaving behind a canvas that is mostly clear, the chill of the air hinting at a low around 46 degrees. The soft whisper of the north-northwest wind, barely stirring, adds a subtle freshness that invigorates the senses. As the day unfolds, the sun will stretch its rays to warm the city, peaking at a modest high of near 60 before the temperature gently descends in the afternoon, echoing a whisper of coolness as it approaches 56 degrees.\n\nWith this inviting weather, it seems only fitting to don layers; a light jacket or a cozy sweater will provide comfort against the cool morning breeze, while breathable fabrics remain ideal for the afternoon sun. As you step out into the gentle bustle of the city, consider a leisurely walk along the waterfront, where the shimmering water reflects the brightening skies. A visit to one of the cozy cafes could beckon, offering a chance to savor a warm drink while watching the world awaken. Alternatively, you might wander through the tranquil parks, enjoying the crisp air and the beauty of a day that promises to delight.",
