    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens beneath a quilt of clouds, softly cloaked in a lingering coolness. The overnight gloom gives way to the promise of a pleasant day; by midday, the sun will temper the chilly breeze with a warm embrace. Temperatures will hover around the low sixties, a gentle reminder of the summer's gradual bloom as the marine layer retreats into memory. \n\nWhile patches of fog may linger around the iconic Golden Gate, obscuring the bridge's majestic contours, the view toward downtown reveals a world emerging from the night. The air carries the crispness of the Pacific, ideal for leisurely strolls\u2014perhaps a trip to one of the local coffee shops where the aroma of freshly brewed espresso dances alongside light conversations. A light sweater or a cozy jacket would offer comfort against the morning chill, especially if one finds themselves near the waterfront, where the cool breezes whisper sweet nothings across the bay. This Sunday, the weather invites simple pleasures: a walk along the Embarcadero, a visit to the Ferry Building, or simply basking in the vibrant energy of the city's square\u2014each moment a celebration of what it means to live in this timeless place.",
