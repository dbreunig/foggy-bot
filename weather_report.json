Dressed in layers allows one to savor the chill of the morning while embracing the warmth that follows sunlit hours. A light jacket complemented by a comfortable tee adds an air of casual elegance, perfect for a stroll through the Embarcadero or an unhurried visit to one of the city\u2019s charming caf\u00e9s.
