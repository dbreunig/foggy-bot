    "weather_report": "The early hours of this morning greet San Francisco with a gentle twilight, a soft cloak of partly cloudy skies hovering over the city as the temperature descends to a comfortable 50 degrees. The muted embrace of the wind whispers softly from the west-southwest, adding a hint of coolness to the air. As day breaks, it promises to unfold into a sunny delight, where the warmth of the sun will rise to approximately 60 degrees, inviting golden rays to bathe the iconic skyline.\n\nAdventurers and city dwellers alike will find today a canvas for exploration. The gentle breeze of 7 to 15 miles per hour, occasionally gusting, suggests a day that feels invigorating yet not overwhelming. Those wandering outdoors may find the slight chill in the morning air calls for layers; a snug light jacket or sweater paired with breathable attire will strike the perfect chord between comfort and style. With the fog of early morning dissipating into clarity as the day progresses, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to the nearby parks, where the landscape awaits, ready to awaken in all its vibrant hues. Alternatively, savoring a warm cup at a local caf\u00e9 while watching the world unfurl could be the perfect indulgence for this serene day.",
