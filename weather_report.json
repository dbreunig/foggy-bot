    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the city breathes with the weight of clouds thickening above. Showers and thunder rumble like distant murmurs, hardly disturbing the tranquility, while the cool air dances softly at the precipice of 45 degrees, with a hint of warmth promising to sweep in just after the midnight hour. Wisps of fog creep along the edges of the city, cloaking the Golden Gate Bridge in a delicate, ghostly veil. The clarity of the night is marred only by the promise of rain, a reminder that spring's fickle temperament often stirs beneath the surface.\n\nCome morning, expect a vast transformation. The storm clouds are likely to give way to sunshine, yet the scent of rain will linger in the air as temperatures rise to a cool 53 degrees. Those venturing out might want to wrap themselves in layers\u2014comfortable yet resilient against the brisk winds sweeping in from the west. A light jacket would be prudent, accompanied perhaps by a sturdy pair of shoes for traversing the city\u2019s cobbled streets. With the weather shifting, a stroll through the vibrant local markets or a quiet moment in one of the many parks could provide a refreshing escape. An afternoon spent perusing books in a cozy caf\u00e9, warmed by the glow of soft lights, may just be the perfect respite from the fleeting storms that have passed and those yet to come.",
