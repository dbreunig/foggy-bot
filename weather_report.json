    "weather_report": "The day dawns in Downtown San Francisco with the promise of mild weather, draped in the cool embrace of a west southwest wind. Glints of sunshine scatter across the city, punctuated by a gentle melancholic hue of the iconic fog, which lingers just beyond the Golden Gate. There\u2019s a certain clarity to the air, though hints of a coming marine layer invite a subtle mystery. As the hours pass, expect temperatures to meander softly around 62 degrees by afternoon, inviting the occasional breeze that dances through the streets, whispering tales of distant horizons. \n\nAs for the evening, a touch of drizzle may weave its way through the clear night, bringing with it a soothing chill, settling into the low of 54. A light jacket or a cozy sweater, perhaps layered with a scarf, will serve you well as you stroll through the streets, capturing the city\u2019s vibrant energy or settling into a quiet caf\u00e9, where you might indulge in the evening\u2019s musings with a warm drink in hand. This is a day to savor both the sun's fleeting warmth and the seductive coolness of impending night, where each moment offers a new appreciation of this coastal urban tapestry.",
