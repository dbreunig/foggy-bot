The remnants of moisture lingering in the air are bound to dissipate, giving way to patches of sunlight\u2014each beam a lovely invitation to step outside. With temperatures projected to rise near a cool 62, the breeze from the west may feel a bit nippy through the day; gusts will flirt dangerously close to 21 mph, rustling the edges of a light jacket or a soft scarf more than one might hope.\n\nAs the clouds linger well into the evening, tonight promises an embrace of warmth, albeit slightly humid, with a lows settling around 56. Those adventuring out might consider wearing layers, perhaps a lightweight sweater or hoodie to combat the chill that speaks of ocean whispers. The atmosphere invites low-key activities: a stroll through the Mission District, perhaps, or a cozy visit to a local caf\u00e9 where the sounds of conversation intermingle with the aroma of coffee. Embrace the delightful, subdued energy of the day, and let the city share its understated beauty as it reveals the hidden gems beneath its cloudy curtain.",
