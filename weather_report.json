    "weather_report": "The afternoon sky in Downtown San Francisco reveals a comforting clarity, a gentle sun bathing the streets in a soft warmth, though the temperature hints at a chill beneath the surface. As the hours slip away, the highs will mellow, falling to a cool embrace, while wind whispers through the bustling city, echoing the promise of changing tides. With the sun making a brief exit, a dramatic swoon into evening nears, a rain that will veil the skyline after dark. The clouds, already gathering their sumptuous plushness, portend a 90% chance of precipitation later tonight, bringing with them the soothing rhythm of raindrops against pavement.\n\nDress in layers, soft knits and cozy jackets are prudent as the delightful day surrenders to the cooler embrace of dusk. An umbrella may be wise company come nightfall, but for now, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront beckons. Perhaps indulge in a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, sipping a warm drink while watching the city pulse with life, as evening hints at its arrival through the gathering clouds. The day whispers tales of serenity wrapped in a simple, inviting charm.",
