    "weather_report": "As the day transitions into evening in Downtown San Francisco, the remnants of a mostly sunny afternoon linger, where hints of warmth still cling to the air, though the temperatures have begun their gentle descent. Wispy clouds shift above, partly filtering the softening light, creating a canvas that speaks of tranquility rather than tumult. The golden hues of sunset may tease their way through the thinning clouds, though a subtle blanket of the marine layer tucks itself around the edges of the bay, softly veiling the distant hills. \n\nTonight beckons with a promise of coolness, the forecast suggesting a low that will encourage a cozy embrace of layers. A cardigan or light jacket may serve well against the seaside whispers of wind that drift through the streets. As evening unfolds, the city presents a gentle allure for those seeking subdued adventures. Perhaps a leisurely stroll along the promenades or a heady cup of coffee in a local caf\u00e9 allows one to bask in the chill of the night air, all while pondering the stories embraced within the folds of this historic landscape.",
