    "weather_report": "As we embrace this summer day in Downtown San Francisco, a crisp clarity settles over the city, though hints of the marine layer play at the edges of the horizon. The sun casts a gentle glow, promising a high near 65, while the afternoon will soften that warmth to about 63. The brisk wind from the west southwest, whispering at times above 20 mph, adds a lively energy, occasionally lifting the cool fog along the coastline, like strokes of a painter's brush across the canvas of city views.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the clouds will gather, weaving a delicate tapestry over the city, with evening temperatures settling around 56. The wind will remain a consistent companion, keeping the air lively but inviting. Dress in layers today\u2014perhaps a light jacket to combat the chill, particularly as you stroll along the Embarcadero or enjoy a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9 with a view of the Bay. This is a day for simple pleasures, ideal for a leisurely walk through the streets or a visit to a local market, where seasonal fruits and handmade goods beckon with their charm. With the weather teasing a blend of warmth and coolness, the city invites you to savor both the sunlit moments and the soft embrace of evening clouds.",
