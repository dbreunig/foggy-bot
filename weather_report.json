Though hints of fog may flirt at the peripheries, the overall atmosphere appears clear and inviting, promising a sunny day ahead. As the sun rises higher, temperatures will gradually warm, reaching a mild sixties before settling into a contemplative chill by afternoon.\n\nWith the forecasted breeze, it is wise to don layers\u2014perhaps a lightweight jacket over a casual shirt to navigate the subtle shifts in temperature. As the day unfolds, the sunshine invites leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s. Consider spending time at an outdoor seating area to savor a warm beverage, allowing the warmth of the sun to intermingle with the crisp air. This is a day for quiet contemplation or casual gatherings, perfect for soaking in the allure of the city while the fog holds its distance.",
