    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds blankets the city, hinting at a slight chance of drizzle after 11 PM. The temperature is mild, around 55 degrees, inviting a comfortable evening stroll. The west-southwest winds whisper softly through the streets, providing a refreshing touch to the air. While the horizon hints at the playful glow of city lights, a fine mist may accompany the dusk, reminding us of the marine layer's tender embrace without fully surrendering to fog.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, you can expect a gradual transition from the remnants of night into a day of openness. With a high near 64, the morning may greet you with patches of sun, welcoming the day before the clouds peel back to reveal a sunlit sky. The west winds promise to add a briskness, punctuated by gusts that stir the leaves. For this weather, layering is advised\u2014a light jacket or sweater will serve well in the morning chill, while a comfortable tee may find favor as the day warms. As the day unfolds, consider a leisurely walk through the streets, perhaps discovering a hidden caf\u00e9, or taking the time to enjoy the understated beauty of the gardens and parks that dot the city, where tranquility reigns gently.",
