    "weather_report": "As the night embraces Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds cloaks the city, the air carrying a gentle touch of coolness\u2014a low around 51 degrees prepares for dawn. The winds whisper softly from the west at five miles per hour, echoing the city\u2019s serene ambiance. Morning will unveil a promise of sunshine, coaxing the day towards a comfortable high of 62. The clouds will disperse, revealing the city\u2019s vibrant essence, but the lingering marine layer may still hang over the edges of the bay.\n\nThe sight promises a delightful clarity, where the golden hues of a spring day beckon you outdoors. As nature transitions from the softness of night to the warmth of daylight, one might consider slipping on a light jacket, perhaps cotton or linen, to embrace the fresh coastal air while enjoying a casual stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely coffee break in one of the sunlit cafes. The day shapes itself into a lovely canvas awaiting your brush; take pleasure in the rich pleasures the city offers, savoring each moment under its rejuvenating skies.",
