    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco awakens to a rare moment of clarity this morning, graced by the gentle sun casting soft shadows over the city's iconic landscape. With sunny skies basking the area and the temperature hovering just above the cool threshold of 60, there is a promise of a pleasant day ahead. As the afternoon approaches, temperatures will dip slightly, but the light breeze, whispering from the south, will weave through the streets, adding a refreshing touch to the experience.\n\nTonight, the atmosphere takes on a more subdued tone, with partly cloudy skies ushering in a tranquil low around 46. While the day invites you to step out and engage with the vibrant life of the city, consider dressing in layers. A light jacket may be perfect for the evening stroll as twilight descends, bringing with it a crispness reminiscent of maritime heritage. Take advantage of the inviting conditions by exploring the quieter corners of the city, perhaps enjoying a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, indulging in a book at a caf\u00e9, or simply wandering through the quaint streets revealing stories etched in time. With the fog holding its breath, today invites an embrace of serenity rather than the rush of ordinary life.",
