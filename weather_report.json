    "weather_report": "As the evening envelops Downtown San Francisco, a gentle murmur of clouds drapes the city in a shroud of anticipation, hinting at a slight chance of drizzle after nightfall. With temperatures settling around 52 degrees, the night invites a soft embrace of comfort. The southwest wind carries whispers through the streets, lending a cool touch that lingers in the air. As dusk proceeds, one might find solace in layers; a light jacket will shield against the chill as the city prepares to rest.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the day promises a tentative awakening with a hint of sunshine thrumming beneath the clouds. The high will nudge near 60, but a gradual cooling will accompany the afternoon, ushering in an almost serene dimness. An absence of the sun's full radiance may keep spirits slightly subdued, yet the mild gusts will stir a hint of refreshing clarity, inviting exploration. Perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Ferry Building, with its exquisite artisanal offerings, would satisfy one\u2019s quest for a gentle morning out. As the day unfolds, one might also find delight in a visit to a quaint coffee shop, relishing a warm beverage as an antidote to the crisp air.",
