    "weather_report": "As the quiet murmur of night gives way to the dawning light, Downtown San Francisco greets a night mostly clear, though a gentle whisper of cool air around 56 degrees lingers softly. The morning sky, promising a reprieve from winter\u2019s grip, is gilded with hints of sunlight, a prelude to a day that will unfold one of those rare California delights: mostly sunny conditions, with a high nudging ever closer to 79 degrees before retreating to a cooler embrace of 74 in the afternoon. The north-northeast gusts play lightly at 5 to 6 mph, a subtle reminder of the coast's seasonal winds.\n\nWhether stepping out for a morning stroll or seeking solitude in a favorite caf\u00e9, today offers a splendid backdrop for leisurely pursuits. The clarity of the day is warm enough to encourage that new lightweight jacket, perfect for the slightly crisp air of the morning, while the afternoon might coax a change to something more summery as temperatures rise. Visibility should be good, so the iconic hills and the clamor of the city should feel inviting rather than oppressive. With no fog marring the horizon, one might indulge in a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, perhaps grabbing a coffee from one of the local haunts, watching the city come alive as boats skim across the Bay in the morning sun. Today, the city feels like a canvas waiting patiently for the brushstrokes of everyday moments, each imbued with the simple beauty of a clear, warm spring day.",
