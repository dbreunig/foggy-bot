    "weather_report": "As the sun rises gently over Downtown San Francisco on this Memorial Day, there\u2019s a refreshing clarity in the air, promising a pleasant day ahead. The golden rays break through the remaining wisps of fog, which cling to the edges of the Golden Gate Bridge and caress the hills, hinting at the remnants of the marine layer that often graces the city. With temperatures expected to peak around a comfortable 62 degrees, the gentle west wind will add a delightful coolness, making a light sweater or jacket a perfect companion for today's explorations.\n\nWith such inviting weather, opportunities abound for a leisurely stroll through one of the city's storied parks, or perhaps to wander along the Embarcadero amidst lively conversations and the distant sounds of laughter. The relatively clear skies beckon for a visit to a nearby caf\u00e9, where one can sip coffee while soaking in the vibrant street life. As the day unfolds into evening and the temperatures dip toward a cool 50 degrees, one might enjoy the transition under a navy sky adorned with sparkling city lights, making the closing hours as enchanting as the day itself.",
