    "weather_report": "The sun graces Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, casting a pleasant glow over the city. As the day unfolds, the temperature hovers around a mild 62 degrees, gently retreating towards the cooler embrace of 59 as afternoon wears on, while a soft west-northwest breeze\u2014weaving through the streets\u2014offers a refreshing touch. The skies are mostly clear, promising a clarity that enhances the iconic skyline and the surrounding landscape. There\u2019s little in the way of fog or marine layer today; the famed fog that often clings tenaciously to the Golden Gate seems to have found a quiet retreat, leaving the bridge and bay in stark outline against a crisp blue backdrop.\n\nAs evening approaches, the temperature will slide gracefully to a tranquil 47 degrees, encouraging one to don layers that balance comfort with a sense of style\u2014perhaps a light jacket or cardigan befitting a stroll through the parks or along the waterfront. Outdoor cafes invite patrons to linger, a perfect setting for enjoying a warm drink while listening to distant waves lapping at the shoreline. Whether indulging in a quiet book in one of the sunlit plazas or wandering through vibrant art galleries, the day beckons with understated charm.",
