    "weather_report": "As the clock turns to the late hours in Downtown San Francisco, the city wears a quiet cloak of cloudiness, with the temperatures slinking towards a low around fifty. The evening air carries a gentle west wind, whispering promises of chill, and the tide of the bay coats the atmosphere with a saline freshness. Tonight, the skies are mostly cloudy, with hints of moonlight timidly peeking through the veil, casting a soft glow over the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the dawning light will bring a mix of partly sunny intervals, although expect afternoon temperatures to cool subtly, settling near fifty-six. The fog, persistent yet playful, will be widespread. It lingers near the coast, providing a moody backdrop for the city and its surrounding hills. In light of these conditions, dressing in layers is wise\u2014a lightweight jacket to fend off the early chill, accompanied by a cozy scarf, will serve one well. Tomorrow's charm lies in its understated beauty: a stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet coffee in a local caf\u00e9 may be just the understated delight the weekend warrants. Enjoy the serene cadence of the city that ebbs and flows with the rhythm of the tides and the clouds above.",
