A gentle breeze whispers through the streets, carrying with it the promise of a mild day ahead. Settle into the comforting embrace of a cozy sweater or light jacket, as the morning chill crawls toward 47 degrees, before the afternoon offers a pleasant respite, nudging temperatures near 65.\n\nThe day unfolding will be predominantly sunny, though the afternoon may greet us with a subtle shift, as the warmth recedes to a comfortable 60 degrees. While there are no immediate signs of the infamous fog that often blankets this area, the edges of the city may wear a light mist that dances along the waterfront\u2014silent and serene. As the sun rises higher, the clarity of the day will reveal stunning views, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment in one of the many parks. Embrace a simple caf\u00e9 visit with a warm beverage, allowing the day to reveal its charm in unhurried exploration.",
