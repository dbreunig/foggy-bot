    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun casts a warm, golden light over the intricate mosaic of buildings, shaping outlines against a crisp azure sky. There is barely a whisper of fog to be found, the marine layer holding demurely at bay, allowing for an unblemished view of the Golden Gate Bridge standing proud in the distance. With a gentle breeze from the west, the air feels fresh, almost invigorating, making it the perfect time to venture outdoors and absorb the vitality of the city.\n\nAs the day shifts towards evening, expect mostly clear skies to remain, ushering in a brisk but pleasant night with temperatures softening into the low fifties. A light jacket would be wise as you head out, perhaps for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero where the skyline twinkles to life, hinting at the thrumming energy of a city that never truly sleeps. This is a moment to cherish the simple joys, perhaps by indulging in a quiet coffee on a patio or perusing a local bookstore where the scent of paper mingles effortlessly with that crisp air. Enjoy the day; it has much to offer.",
