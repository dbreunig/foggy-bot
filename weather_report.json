    "weather_report": "As the early morning drifts into the quiet of dawn, the air carries a refreshing chill, with the coolness settling around 54 degrees. The once-dominant gray clouds have started to part, allowing glimpses of the gentle blue sky to filter through. The West Southwest wind whispers through the city streets, creating a soft rustle among the leaves of trees lining Mission Street, and hinting at a more vibrant day ahead. By the time the sun rises higher, expect mostly sunny skies, transforming the horizon into a delicate palette where the iconic skyline meets the picturesque backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nYet, the warming day will not strip away the coolness entirely; a serene balance is to be found as temperatures hover near 63 degrees, eventually retreating slightly as the afternoon progresses. The breeze may pick up, gusting to 30 miles per hour, and the remnants of yesterday\u2019s marine layer might cling subtly to the bay, so keep a light sweater or a windbreaker on hand. A leisurely walk along the Embarcadero could be particularly enjoyable, with the calm waters shimmering gently in the sunlight, and the occasional view of kite surfers courting the waves. Alternatively, you may find solace in a local caf\u00e9, sipping coffee while reflecting on the world outside as it stirs eagerly into life.",
