    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Downtown San Francisco, the evening air carries a gentle crispness, ushering in a predominantly cloudy sky. The temperature settles comfortably in the upper fiftys, accompanied by a steady west-southwest breeze that whispers through the city streets, occasionally punctuated by gusts that remind one of the ocean\u2019s presence. The low-hanging clouds paint a textured canvas above, suggesting a playful dance between fog and clarity, although tonight\u2019s forecast hints at the latter. \n\nFriday beckons with promises of sunny weather, a refreshing contrast to tonight\u2019s murky ambiance. Expect a high near 70, as daylight unfolds, the sun steadily coaxing the temperature up while clouds recede into memory. The gentle wind will persist, an ideal companion for a leisurely stroll or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where one can enjoy a warm drink against the backdrop of the bay and the distant silhouette of the Golden Gate. As the marine layer ebbs, it might be wise to dress in layers, allowing for comfort whether enjoying the lingering coolness or basking in the welcoming sun. The evening could be an invitation for quiet reflection, a stroll along the waterfront, or simply savoring the comforting aroma of freshly baked pastries from a nearby bakery, as the city settles into the embrace of night.",
