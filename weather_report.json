    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the city is enveloped in a cloak of showers and rumbling thunder, the air carrying a symphony of moisture interlaced with the scent of impending rain. The temperatures, lingering in the cool embrace of the 40s, are set to gently rise through the night, though a west-southwest wind, gusting playfully, keeps the atmosphere lively. Those with plans to step out must consider a well-prepared shell against the dampness that lingers in the air\u2014perhaps a lightweight, waterproof jacket paired with close-fitting layers to grace against the cool northern breeze.\n\nCome Thursday, the showers are expected to taper off by the afternoon, yielding to patches of sunshine that promise to warm the day up to a modest high of 53 degrees. The veil of clouds will dance away, revealing glimpses of that famous skyline, though the gusty winds will remain constant companions. The scene during the day may oscillate; the clarity of the heart of the city intermittently punctured by the remnants of yesterday\u2019s tempest. As fog settles over the hills, it invites a quietude best suited for indoor pursuits. A good read in a cozy caf\u00e9 or a leisurely visit to a local museum would be splendid on such a day, allowing for the simple pleasures of warmth and reflection as the elements transform outside.",
