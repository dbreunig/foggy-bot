    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco awakens under a canvas of soft, muted clouds, leaning toward the sunny side, yet retaining a hint of mystery. The air is sharp and crisp, characteristic of an early spring morning. As daylight nudges the shadows aside, temperatures will gently rise to a comfortable mid-sixties, complemented by a west-southwest breeze that whispers through the streets and alleys, playfully tousling the edges of a light jacket. \n\nToday promises a blend of charm and tranquility, punctuated by only the faintest hint of cloud cover, lending a wistful quality to the skyline. While the fog lingers offshore, it dances just beyond the reach of the iconic Golden Gate, allowing the city to bask in clarity without the usual marine blanket. For those venturing out, a light sweater or a long-sleeve shirt is advised, perfect for the afternoon's cool embrace. It\u2019s an ideal day for a quiet stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely visit to a neighborhood caf\u00e9, tied together by an unhurried spirit that encourages exploration in familiar corners. Whether sipping coffee while people-watching or meandering through parks, the allure of the day beckons with understated elegance.",
