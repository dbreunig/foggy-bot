    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds beneath a vivid blue sky that lends an air of tranquility to the bustling city. With the sun casting its warm glow, temperatures hover comfortably around the low seventies. The gentle embrace of a westerly breeze plays among the tall structures, ruffling leaves and stirring the atmosphere. Clarity reigns as the marine layer that often cloaks the city has receded, allowing shimmering views across the bay, with the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge standing proudly against the horizon.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect a transition to a mostly clear night, where the coolness will settle in, reaching a pleasant low in the upper fifties. It would be wise to have a light sweater or a light jacket at hand as the evening unfolds. This splendid weather invites not only the casual stroll along the waterfront but also a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, sipping warm cocoa while observing the city\u2019s life slow down. Tonight promises an ambiance filled with warmth and comfort, ideal for savoring the beauty of a San Francisco evening from a cozy perch.",
