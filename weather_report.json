    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco basks under a mostly sunny afternoon, the sun casting its gentle warmth over the skyline. Yet, there\u2019s a coolness in the air, a reminder that nature\u2019s touch remains ever-present. As the afternoon unfolds, temperatures will drift downwards towards the comforting embrace of 60 degrees. The west winds, brisk at around 21 mph, whisper through the streets, occasionally gusting, adding an invigorating edge to the day. Tonight, the clouds will softly roll in, cloaking the city in a blanket of gray, with temperatures dipping to a mild 53 degrees.\n\nWhile the clarity of the day invites a stroll along the waterfront or a pleasant gathering in one of the city\u2019s parks, be mindful of the swirling marine layer that often creeps in as evening approaches, obscuring the horizon and wrapping the hills in a veil of mist. Dress in layers: a light sweater coupled with a jacket will serve you well, ensuring comfort in the chill of the breeze and as the daylight wanes. Perhaps this evening, indulge in a leisurely dinner at a cozy bistro, allowing the flavorful embrace of a warm meal to offset the cool night air.",
