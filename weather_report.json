    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco wakes up bathed in the soft hues of a tranquil morning, poised under a clear sky that promises another delightful day. As the sunshine kisses the city, it hints at warmth around the low sixties, before giving way to a slight afternoon coolness. The air is crisp, accompanied by a gentle breeze whispering tales of the bay. In this peaceful dawn, visibility is delightful, with no hint of the fog that often blankets the city, allowing clear views of the iconic skyline and the illustrious Golden Gate Bridge standing proud against the sea.\n\nAs the sun climbs higher, dressing in layers is prudent; a light sweater will offer comfort against the chill of the wind, while short sleeves would suffice to revel in the sun\u2019s warmth when it reigns supreme. Consider an afternoon stroll along the coastal paths or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s serene parks. The allure of a leisurely coffee in a sun-drenched caf\u00e9 can be irresistible, its aroma blending perfectly with the vibrant energy of the day. Let the light guide you as you embrace this golden morning in the heart of the city.",
