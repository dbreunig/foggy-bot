    "weather_report": "In the embrace of a radiant afternoon, Downtown San Francisco basks under a sky of brilliant blue. Today\u2019s warmth carries a gentle promise, as temperatures glide to around 65 degrees, before retreating slightly toward the comfort of mid-60s as the sun begins its descent. The absence of fog reveals an unobstructed view of the Golden Gate, its majestic form standing sentinel over the shimmering waters below. A soft breeze, whispering from the west-northwest, lends a refreshing quality, making an afternoon stroll along the waterfront a delight.\n\nAs evening approaches, a shift will gently cloak the city with a patchwork of partial clouds, the low dipping to a cozy 50 degrees, accompanied by a calming breeze. This temperate transition invites layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater for the evening jaunt and comfortable shoes to navigate the streets adorned by the fading sunlight. One might consider meandering to a nearby caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of coffee or indulging in the local culinary offerings. With such splendid weather, each corner of this vibrant city is an invitation, beckoning you to explore, unwind, and appreciate the unspoiled beauty of a San Francisco day.",
