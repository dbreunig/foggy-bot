    "weather_report": "As the quiet night drapes itself over downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is thick with a gentle cool, the air embracing you with its moisture. Above, a veil of clouds casts a soft shadow, hinting at a not-so-distant morning where the sun will awaken, spilling light across the famous skyline. The temperature, lingering around 55, is perfect for a light jacket, perhaps something woven with a touch of warmth for those occasional gusts that dance mischievously through the streets. As you prepare to turn in for the night, breathe in the solace that this city offers, the winds softly rustling like whispers in a hidden garden.\n\nTomorrow, you\u2019ll awaken to a slightly warmer embrace; the sun's eager rays will break through the clouds, revealing a brisk yet pleasant day\u2014a perfect 65 degrees dipping into a mild 62 as afternoon unfurls. A leisurely stroll along the waterfront might call to you, as the breeze plays coy, occasionally brushing against the back of your neck. As the fog lifts, revealing both harbor and hill, the city\u2019s character emerges anew; its beauty bathed in the crisp clarity of sunlight. Enjoy a quiet brunch at a caf\u00e9, then wander through the local galleries or perhaps a bookstore, the choices as vibrant as the paint on the canvases. Your light attire will do well\u2014a comfortable shirt paired with layers that allow you to bask in warmth when the sun finds its stride but still shielded from those playful gusts. It is a day where simplicity can be savored, and the ordinary becomes extraordinary through the lens of the San Francisco spirit.",
