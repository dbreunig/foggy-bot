    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco is wrapped in a blanket of quiet chill, the sky largely obscured by clouds that murmur secrets of the ocean. The winds, a gentle but brisk west-southwest breeze, dance through the streets at around 13 to 16 mph, their breath occasionally gusting to 20, as if reminding the city of the impending summer lyre. With temperatures sinking to a low of around 53, it\u2019s a perfect evening for a light jacket or a cozy scarf, inviting one to linger a moment longer under a streetlamp, sipping a warm beverage.\n\nAs dawn unfurls tomorrow, a transformation begins. Expect mostly sunny skies, a refreshing shift where the clouds part to reveal the light and warmth, reaching an encouraging high near 62. However, the cooling breath of the breeze may temper that warmth, nudging temperatures back down to a mild 60 by afternoon. The marine layer will likely persist, veiling the coastline in delicate fog, hinting at the playful dance of maritime breezes. As you embrace the day, consider a stroll along one of the city\u2019s charming neighborhoods, or an intimate caf\u00e9 visit where the chatter of locals warms the air, echoing the very essence of San Francisco.",
