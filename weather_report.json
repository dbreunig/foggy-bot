    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of patchy fog drapes softly across the city, whispering the secrets of the bay. The air feels heavy with a hint of moisture, carrying the distinct scent of impending rain that is both fresh and alive. The temperature hovers around a comfortable 62 degrees, while gentle winds from the west southwest rustle through the streets, their soft sighs creating a rhythm within the stillness. A slight chance of rain lingers on the horizon, likely to arrive before dawn, teasing the promise of a rejuvenating shower.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the fog may linger, inviting a chance of rain showers until the afternoon. Clouds will dance above, casting shadows over a city waking slowly to a partly sunny day with highs reaching 67, before settling to a cooler 65 later on. The wind, ever-present, will continue its quiet serenade, stirring the leaves and encouraging early risers to embrace a morning stroll. For comfort, a light jacket is advisable, perhaps layered over a breathable tee; this ensures you're ready for any unexpected drizzles while still enjoying the clarity that will emerge as the sun begins to reveal itself. An early visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, or a leisurely walk along the waterfront, will allow you to experience the unique beauty of the city, where the fog and light weave stories that are both familiar and new.",
