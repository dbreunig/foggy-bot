As the sun prepares to ascend, the hope of a mostly sunny day beckons just beyond the horizon. By afternoon, a high near 65 will grace the day, a modest warmth bringing a certain cheerfulness, yet with the subtle promise of cooler breezes weaving through the bustling streets. \n\nAlthough the gray veil may wax and wane, indications of the marine layer linger, perhaps skirting the edges of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, creating a misty suggestion of the Pacific\u2019s proximity. Layering is prudent today\u2014consider a light sweater layered beneath a comfortable jacket for those brisk moments that often accompany the wind-whipped avenues. It may be an excellent opportunity to stroll along the waterfront or lose oneself in one of the city\u2019s cozy cafes, watching the world unfold as residents embrace the evolving day. A walk along the Embarcadero or a quiet visit to the Ferry Building could prove to be a delightful escape.",
