    "weather_report": "As the early morning drifts quietly into the waking hours of Downtown San Francisco, a tender blanket of clouds settles over the city. There is a whisper of drizzle, hinting at the moisture lingering in the air, but for now, it ebbs into a hesitant quietude. The temperature, hugging the mildness of fifty-five degrees, invites a gentle embrace of layers. A soft wind from the west southwest, barely stirring the heart of the morning, adds that familiar chill that lingers in the fog-kissed streets.\n\nAnticipating the daylight, the horizon promises clearer skies, a gradual unveiling of a sun that may push the temperature to a comfortable sixty-four by midday. The day ahead will be marked by a playful dance of sunshine, interspersed with the lounging shadows cast by the cloud cover that still dances about the Golden Gate. For those stepping out, a light jacket or sweater would be wise, for the cool breeze could surprise even the most seasoned San Franciscan. The outdoor caf\u00e9 scene, with its huddled patrons sipping warm brews, is ripe with possibility this Wednesday. One could stroll along the Embarcadero, relishing the tranquility of the water, perhaps catching a glimpse of playful seals or the distant Marina, or meander into the haunts of North Beach, where the scents of fresh pastries and robust coffee beckon. Today, amidst the subtle interplay of fog and sunlight, the city does not rush; it savors the moment, and so might you.",
