The temperature is poised to dip to around fifty degrees, inviting one to don a light jacket or a comfortable sweater, perfect for savoring the briskness that defines this coastal city. The remnants of the day's warmth linger, though with the sun setting, the evening promises a tranquil close.\n\nTomorrow, expect the sun to make a welcomed return, casting a cheerful glow over the cityscape with bright, mostly sunny skies. The high will gracefully hover near sixty-three, gradually receding slightly as the day matures, so layers will remain essential\u2014comfortably breathable yet warm enough to fend off any lingering breezes. Amidst this clarity, the typical San Francisco fog may whisper around the edges, especially near the majestic Golden Gate, but none shall obscure the city\u2019s spirited character. With such favorable weather, wanderers may find joy in a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, seeking out hidden nooks or a quiet caf\u00e9 to enjoy the flavors of the city\u2019s vibrant food scene.",
