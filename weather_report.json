    "weather_report": "As dusk gently settles over Downtown San Francisco, the sky is a tapestry of muted blues, while a soft, ethereal marine layer blankets the city. Tonight, the weather is partly cloudy, with temperatures dipping to a crisp 50 degrees. A steady southwest wind whispers through the streets, lending a touch of chill to the air. For those venturing outside, a light jacket or sweater will offer just the right amount of comfort against the cool breeze that accompanies the setting sun.\n\nAs we look toward the day ahead, a delightful transformation awaits. Tuesday promises to unveil a mostly sunny canvas, with temperatures climbing close to 64 degrees, dipping slightly in the afternoon. The southwest wind will remain gentle, creating an inviting atmosphere perfect for leisurely strolls or outdoor caf\u00e9 visits. The lingering fog will likely retreat, revealing the stunning outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the iconic skyline. In such lovely conditions, one might indulge in a peaceful walk along the waterfront or explore the hidden nooks of the neighborhood, perhaps stopping for a warm cup of coffee or a bite to eat at a local eatery, savoring the simple pleasures of urban life.",
