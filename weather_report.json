    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds hugs the city, cradling it in a cozy embrace. The air carries a crispness that hints at the fleeting chill of night, ideal for a leisurely morning stroll with a light jacket wrapped around you. By midday, the sun will emerge, casting a warm glow over the buildings as the temperature nudges towards a comfortable 60 degrees. Some gentle gusts, flavorful of the sea, will dance through your hair, perfect for invigorating the spirit.\n\nWhile patches of fog may linger along the fringes where land meets water, the day promises to unfold with increasing clarity. The iconic Golden Gate Bridge might play coy, its towers peeking shyly between wisps of cloud, but soon the dazzling sunlight will coax them fully into view. It's the kind of day that invites exploration rather than confinement; consider visiting a quiet caf\u00e9 to sip a rich brew while the world stirs to life outside, or perhaps a gentle walk along the waterfront, where the cool breeze will refresh your senses and the salt air nourishes the soul. \n\nDressing in layers will serve you well; allow for the morning chill, but embrace the warmth of the rising sun that beckons the city to awaken. As the afternoon sun goes to work transforming the skies, you may find yourself smiling, knowing San Francisco\u2019s charm is alive and well today.",
