    "weather_report": "Awakening to a serene morning in Downtown San Francisco, the day promises to be a mix of golden light and gentle breezes. The sun emerges, casting a warm gleam over the cityscape, hinting at a high temperature around 62 degrees. As the day stretches ahead, the soft, south-southwest winds, delicate and playful, weave through the streets, serving as companions to those who venture outside. \n\nHowever, the shadows of night have not fully retreated. Patchy fog lingers, particularly near the edges of the bay, veiling the iconic Golden Gate Bridge in a ghostly embrace, offering a subtle reminder of nature\u2019s presence. The clarity, especially as morning deepens, is promising, yet the marine layer may lay low, cloaking parts of the city until afternoon warmth fully asserts itself. As the evening approaches, a gentle chill will set in, sliding towards the mid-50s, calling for a light jacket or a layered approach if one is to enjoy a stroll along the waterfront or relish a quiet moment at the park. \n\nThe weather beckons one to immerse in the city\u2019s charm\u2014perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to savor a freshly brewed cup of coffee, followed by a leisurely walk through the winding streets, where the glowing fa\u00e7ades of buildings tell stories of the past. As the day unfolds, embracing both the sun and the mystery of the fog, one might find that today is not merely a Tuesday, but an invitation to lose oneself in the understated elegance of San Francisco.",
