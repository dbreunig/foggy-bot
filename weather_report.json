    "weather_report": "As evening settles softly over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of cloud quietly embraces the city, hinting at an uncertain intimacy with the night. The temperature hovers comfortably around 52 degrees, a gentle reminder that the chill of spring still whispers through the streets. Calm winds gusting from the southwest waft through the alleys, carrying a hint of the ocean\u2019s breath that merges with the low-hanging clouds. While the cityscape is obscured at the fringes, the glow of streetlights reflects off the marine layer, creating a soft luster that dances playfully on the damp pavement.\n\nTomorrow promises a glimmer of sunlight, though it\u2019s likely to be filtered as it rises and washes over the iconic skyline. With expectations of a high near 60, the day may reveal itself as partly sunny but still modestly cool. Dress in layers; a light jacket or sweater will meld seamlessly with morning's coolness, while a comfortable tee can be your partner as the sun bravely pushes through the clouds. For those contemplating the day ahead amidst this mellowness, a stroll through the nearby parks or a visit to a local caf\u00e9\u2014where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the day\u2019s first light\u2014could be just the remedy for the heart. Engage with the world at a tranquil pace, pausing to savor both the ambiance and the subtle rhythms of this ever-evolving city.",
