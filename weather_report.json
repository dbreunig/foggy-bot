    "weather_report": "As twilight embraces Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds hangs over the city, hinting at the faint possibility of a light drizzle later this evening. With temperatures softly settling around fifty-two degrees, the air carries a brisk hint of southwest wind, rustling leaves and stirring a sense of anticipation in those who venture out. The clouds cast a muted cloak over the vibrant cityscape, softening the edges of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, whose grandeur feels almost ethereal under tonight\u2019s watchful sky. With a mere twenty percent chance of precipitation, the drizzle is but a whisper of moisture, a brief caress from the coastal air.\n\nCome Tuesday, the morning may greet us with that same delicate chance of drizzle before retreating, giving way to fleeting glimpses of sunshine. The high, reaching near sixty, will ease into cooler temperatures as the afternoon unfolds, a reminder of the city's coastal breath. Dress in layers: perhaps a lightweight jacket that can be shed as the sun attempts to break through the clouds, paired with comfortable shoes for those who find their day unfolding on the pavements of the bustling city. As you stroll past caf\u00e9s and galleries, consider indulging in a leisurely afternoon spent wandering the urban tapestry\u2014exploring hidden corners and charming shops, or simply relishing a warm cup of coffee while gazing out at the fog-tinged horizon. These moments of quiet enjoyment are what truly savor the San Francisco experience.",
