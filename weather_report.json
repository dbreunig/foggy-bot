With a slight chance of morning drizzle before the sun peeks through, the promise of a largely partial afternoon awaits\u2014temperatures will gently rise to the low 60s, though the brisk wind may usher in a slight chill.\n\nThe sky carries a muted palette, a promise of occasional sunshine that could steep the city\u2019s landmarks in warm light, enhancing the beauty of the rooftops and threads of bustling life below. Those venturing outdoors might consider layering\u2014perhaps a light jacket or sweater for the morning\u2019s cool embrace, transitioning to a simple shirt or blouse as the afternoon unfolds. It\u2019s a day to enjoy a stroll along the waterfront, perhaps lingering over coffee at a local caf\u00e9 while watching the lively rhythms of the city shape the soft morning light into a vibrant tapestry of everyday urban life.",
