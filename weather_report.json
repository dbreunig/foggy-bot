    "weather_report": "As the overnight clouds drift away, a calm tranquility blankets Downtown San Francisco, where mild temperatures linger around 52 degrees. The city exudes an elegant charm, bathed in the subdued light of a slumbering morning. The gentle west-southwest wind stirs the air lightly, creating a reassuring presence, perfect for a quiet moment or perhaps a mid-night stroll under the stars. \n\nAs dawn approaches, the forecast promises a radiant sun taking its place in the sky, pushing the mercury closer to a refreshing 59 degrees. The day will be met with a mild west wind, whispering softly and ruffling the waves along the bay. While urban life awakens, fog may linger along the Golden Gate, softening the outlines of the bridge and providing an ethereal tableau for early risers. Those venturing out might opt for a light jacket, perfect against the gentle chill of the morning and the briskness of the wind. This is a day for leisurely walks, perhaps exploring a hidden caf\u00e9 with a warm brew or wandering the waterfront where you can witness the beauty of a sun-kissed bay in full splendor, making the most of this charming spring day.",
