    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun casts a warm golden hue across the city, delicate breezes sweeping the day into gentle motion. With temperatures dropping slightly from a high near 72, the air remains fresh and invigorating, kissed by the westward wind that carries hints of the ocean. The skies are largely clear, a beautiful contrast to the ever-present marine layer that lays just beyond, its presence felt but not overwhelming. As twilight approaches, a cozy evening is promised, with temperatures settling into the mid-50s, providing a perfect backdrop for an evening stroll or a quiet dinner al fresco.\n\nFor those navigating the city streets, lightweight layers are advisable; a light jacket is a thoughtful addition for the coolness that emerges as the sun begins its descent. The clarity of the day beckons the wanderer to explore, whether that means visiting nearby galleries, unwinding at a local caf\u00e9, or simply soaking in the charm that each corner of this vibrant city holds, all beneath an expansive sky that feels open and inviting.",
