    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds gently, touched by the coolness that has come to define this coastal gem. With mostly sunny skies presenting a soft glow, a high of 57 feels pleasantly brisk\u2014not unlike a delicate whisper that refreshes rather than overwhelms. As the afternoon hours begin their subtle descent into evening, a slight chill lingers, hinting at the moisture yet to arrive. By nightfall, there\u2019s a chance of rain, a 20% prospect that seems more like a gentle invitation for those who find beauty in the sound of raindrops against the pavement.\n\nBehind the warmth of the day's sun, the marine layer crouches just beyond, easily obscuring the far reaches of the landscape while allowing intimate glimpses of the city\u2019s vibrant life. For now, the air is clear but expect the onset of evening mist, which can conjure an ethereal charm over the cityscape. As you venture out tonight, layers are the way to go; a light jacket paired with a soft scarf might be your comfortable armor against the creeping chill. Take a moment to stroll through the neighborhoods, perhaps stop for a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9, or wander the historic streets, absorbing the glow of streetlights that dance upon the pavement, inviting you to discover this urban wonder under the watchful embrace of the evening sky.",
