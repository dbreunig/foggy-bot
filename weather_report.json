The promise of rain hovers, the air cool and invigorating at around 48 degrees, with winds whispering from the west. With a chance of 40% precipitation overnight and a cloudiness that stretches across the skyline, the morning presents a wandering spirit with hints of sunlight trying to break through. The temperatures are expected to gently fall throughout the day, making its way toward a high near 54\u2014a cool day which may crank down to the low 50s in the afternoon as winds pick up, sending gusts that dance between 13 to 20 mph.\n\nUnder these conditions, while the day may lack the brilliance of blue skies, there remains an opportunity for a contemplative stroll through the quieter streets or along the waterfront. One might even find pleasure in a cozy caf\u00e9, sipping a warm beverage while watching droplets trace pattern across windows and feeling the pulse of the city as it stirs awake. As for attire, an extra layer is advisable\u2014a light jacket or an easy knit, paired with a comfortable pair of shoes\u2014ideal for both the occasional drizzle and the brisk touch of wind, readying you for the urban adventure that unfolds in this fog-kissed morning ambiance.",
