    "weather_report": "As you step outside this afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sunshine greets you with a warm embrace beneath a clear sky. With temperatures hovering around a crisp 62 degrees, the atmosphere sparkles in the golden light, and the west wind stirs, adding an invigorating freshness to the air. This is not just an ordinary afternoon; it feels like the city is alive, inviting you to wander its picturesque avenues. You might notice the absence of fog, which often cloaks the iconic skyline, as the marine layer has retreated for the moment, leaving the Golden Gate Bridge standing proudly against the backdrop of a serene blue horizon.\n\nAs evening approaches, the warmth will give way to a comfortable coolness, expected to settle around 53 degrees. The west wind, softly whispering at 8 to 18 mph, will gently remind us of the night\u2019s arrival. For these conditions, a light jacket would be wisely paired with layers to adapt to the fluctuating temperatures. Consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the shimmering bay reflects the soft hues of the sunset, or enjoy a cozy dinner at one of the many local eateries that line the charming streets. Tonight\u2019s clarity offers the perfect opportunity to appreciate the city\u2019s twilight charm, an invitation to partake in the quiet magic that unfolds as day transitions to night.",
