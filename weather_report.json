    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a gentle breeze carries the promise of a calm night. The skies are mostly clear, with just a soft hint of the coast's characteristic marine layer lurking at the fringes. The temperature hovers around a comfortable 51 degrees, so it\u2019s wise to wrap yourself in a light jacket or a cozy sweater if you're stepping out. \n\nLooking ahead to Monday, a bright sun will take center stage, casting its warmth over the city with a high near a pleasant 76 degrees. The tranquility of the day will beckon you to enjoy the outdoors. Consider a leisurely stroll through the streets, perhaps making your way to a local caf\u00e9 for some warm coffee, or unwinding in one of the many parks, as the colors of spring continue to bloom vividly. It\u2019s a day that encourages reflection, conversation, and simply soaking in the city's vibrant energy, away from the ocean's chill.",
