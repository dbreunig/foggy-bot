The city, often shrouded in mystery, shows signs of life beneath a soft fog, hinting at the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate, though it remains partially obscured\u2014a teasing preview of the day ahead. The low clouds dance lazily, allowing glimpses of an emerging world beneath; today, the temperature will reach a modest high, where the sun will spar with clouds, suggesting moments of brightness mixed with fleeting shadows.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, expect to see the drizzle fade, giving way to a slightly more cheerful atmosphere. By midday, as the fog retreats and the skies brighten intermittently, it will be a pleasant time to wander through bustling streets or sip coffee at a sun-dappled caf\u00e9. Yet, a light wind will remind you of the city's temperamental nature, so layers are essential\u2014a light sweater over a t-shirt should suffice, both for the morning chill and the potential warmth of an afternoon sun. Embrace the day with a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the sights and sounds of the city harmonize beautifully with the evolving weather, promising a moment of serenity amid the usual bustle of urban life.",
