    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, you\u2019ll find yourself under a sunny sky, though the temperature is gently temperamental, reaching a peak of about 60 before making a slow descent to around 58. The west-southwest winds carry a mild whisper at about 12 mph, a reminder that the day is never truly still in this lively city. As daylight deepens, expect a cloak of mostly cloudy skies to descend, with the mercury dipping to a cozy 50.  \n\nLooking out, the clarity seems shrouded in an intriguing haze, hinting at a thin veil of fog subtly kissing the edges of the coastline. While the vibrant life of the city pulses under the late afternoon sun, the air carries that familiar coolness, beckoning for light layers. A well-chosen lightweight sweater or a casual jacket would serve well, perfect for strolling down vibrant streets or enjoying a peaceful moment in one of the city\u2019s parks. As the sun sets, consider a leisurely walk along the waterfront, where the gentle waves meet you, or perhaps find a cozy caf\u00e9 to sip a warm drink as the skies weave a tapestry of clouds.",
