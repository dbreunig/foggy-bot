    "weather_report": "A tranquil evening unfurls across Downtown San Francisco, with the night sky gradually revealing its stars against a canvas of fading warmth, settling around a gentle 56 degrees. A soft westerly breeze whispers through the streets, promising a spell of clarity in contrast to the usual dance of fog that sometimes cloaks the city. As dawn approaches, a delightful embrace of sunshine will break through, gliding toward a high near 66, giving way to a beautiful afternoon where temperatures gently settle around 64. \n\nThough the morning may bring the kind of brightness that invites a stroll, the cool breezes and hints of coastal chill will linger. Dress comfortably in layers; a light jacket over a cozy tee will suit your day beautifully as you meander through the city\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods or perhaps lose yourself in the art charm of a local caf\u00e9. Whether you choose to wander the waterfront, enchant yourself with the historic streets, or simply contemplate life from a park bench, nature is calling softly, suggesting a delightful day ahead amid the welcoming arms of revealing skies and flourishing warmth.",
