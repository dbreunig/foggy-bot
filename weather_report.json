    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens beneath a mostly sunny sky. It is a morning that exudes warmth, hinting at a high of around 79 degrees as the sun climbs higher. The atmosphere carries a pleasant freshness, softened by a gentle north-northwest breeze cascading through the streets. Presently, the coastal fog lies retreating, tucked away in the shadows of the hills, allowing for a clarity that is invigorating. With temperatures anticipated to dip slightly into the afternoon, from the peak warmth to a lull around 74, today feels like an invitation to wander freely, whether by foot along the waterfront or through the green expanses of Golden Gate Park.\n\nAs the sun begins to set its golden rays behind the Bay, a gentle coolness will drape the city in the evening hours, with temperatures settling around 54 degrees. Tonight, the sky will transform into a canvas of partly cloudy hues, the remnants of the day\u2019s light mingling with the encroaching night. Dress thoughtfully: layers will serve you well against the shifting temperatures\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a cozy shawl for the evening\u2019s descent. Embrace the day\u2019s beauty with a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to one of the local cafes, where the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the salty sea air, creating a perfect backdrop for conversation or quiet contemplation. Today is a reminder that the city, with its iconic sights and hidden gems, is always ready to share its charm, inviting you to uncover the narrative woven into its very fabric.",
