    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm settles over the city, draped in a blanket of partly cloudy skies. The air, crisp and invigorating, hovers around a low of 47 degrees, a reminder that winter\u2019s whisper still lingers on the fringes of spring. The west-northwest winds, nipping playfully at your collar, offer a subtle companionship as they dance between 10 to 14 mph. Tomorrow promises to unfurl a tapestry of mostly sunny skies, with a touch of coolness lingering as temperatures peak near 57 before gracefully drawing down to around 55 in the afternoon.\n\nThe evening feels relatively tranquil, though a hint of the marine layer might embrace the edges of the skyline. Dressing in layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a cozy sweater and a scarf to fend off the chill\u2014would be wise. Perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet caf\u00e9 visit would beckon, allowing the serene beauty of the city to unfold gently before you. As night continues its soft procession, the atmosphere invites contemplation, blending the soft glow of city lights with the distant outlines of the hills, all wrapped in the cool embrace of fresh maritime air.",
