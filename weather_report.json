    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the weather unfolds like a quiet melody, with the afternoon embracing a gentle warmth as the sun weaves in and out amongst scattered clouds. The temperature hovers just above 50 degrees, hinting at a subtle chill in the breeze, a reminder that winter is still whispering in the corners. The winds, brisk and invigorating from the west-northwest, tease the leaves of nearby trees and dance lightly through the streets, making the afternoon feel both brisk and refreshing.\n\nTonight, as the sky darkens to a velvety deep blue, the temperature will dip to a cozy 47 degrees. The clouds will scatter, leaving behind a partially cloudy sky, though remnants of the marine layer may linger near the shoreline, softening the horizon with a whisper of mist. With these conditions, dressing in layers\u2014a light jacket over a sweater and comfortable shoes\u2014would be wise for an evening stroll or a leisurely coffee at a favorite caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee can warm your spirit. Perhaps a quiet walk along the Embarcadero, watching the lights twinkle across the bay, would be the most enchanting way to savor the evening's gentle embrace.",
