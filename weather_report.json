    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is permeated with a gentle heaviness. Cloud cover blankets the sky, lending a melancholic chill to the air, and the temperature hovers between the mid-fifties. A whisper of rain lingers in the forecast, with a modest chance giving reason to pause before venturing out. The westerly winds carry a moist coolness, brushing against the skin like a distant memory of fog that has yet to fully claim the city. Visibility may be obscured, hinting at the presence of a marine layer creeping from the bay, softening the outlines of the skyline and shrouding the Golden Gate Bridge in an ethereal embrace. \n\nThe evening is poised to continue in much the same fashion. With temperatures expected to dip into the lower fifties, it's a stretch where one might favor layers\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater, a light rain jacket, and a sturdy pair of shoes to tread the damp streets. As twilight descends, the muted glow of the city lights will serve as beacons, encouraging leisurely strolls along the waterfront or quiet gatherings in the warmth of a local coffee shop. It's a day that calls for reflection and perhaps a glass of something warming, as the city settles into another delicate dance between its vibrancy and the enveloping fog.",
