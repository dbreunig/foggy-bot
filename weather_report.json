    "weather_report": "As the evening wraps its arms around Downtown San Francisco, the city nestles beneath a quilt of mostly cloudy skies, the temperature dipping to a balmy 60 degrees, kissed by a gentle west wind rustling through the streets. The marine layer lingers at the outskirts, softly veiling landmarks and fostering that characteristic San Francisco mystique. While the clouds may dim the skyline's brilliance, they do not detract from the charm of the illuminated city, where a certain allure persists in the gentle warmth of the night.\n\nTomorrow promises a continuation of this moderate weather, inviting sunlit moments that will emerge from the embrace of cloud cover. The high will flirt with 67 degrees, accompanied by a playful west-southwest breeze, leaving the door open for a perfectly comfortable afternoon stroll. Residents and visitors alike might consider layering light attire with a cardigan or a light jacket, a thoughtful choice for navigating the playful interplay of sun and shade. As you venture out, perhaps meandering through the vibrant streets of the Mission or savoring a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9 by the bay, remember to embrace the unique character of this ever-changing landscape, where fog and sun share the stage in a harmonious dance.",
