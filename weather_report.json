One might dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a jacket to match the morning coolness, layering down to a simple tee as the sun reaches its zenith. The scenery, unmarred by fog, reveals the city\u2019s iconic landmarks in all their glory, inviting leisurely strolls along the waterfront or an exploration of the vibrant streets that pulse with life.
