    "weather_report": "The night drapes itself over Downtown San Francisco, whispering promises of an unhurried morning bathed in muted hues. As the city stirs awake, the clouds settle low, veiling the skyline with a soft touch, a gentle cloak against the dawn. A light breeze drifts in from the west, carrying with it the scent of the ocean, hinting at the ever-present dance between the fog and the buildings that stand sentry along the bay. Today, as the sun rises, expect it to struggle against the grays and whites that linger over head\u2014showing only brief glimpses of its warmer embrace.\n\nFor those stepping out this morning, a light jacket will serve well as the cool atmosphere gently envelops. The forecast predicts a high near 56, harmonizing with the brisk winds that may lift a light shiver. Activities could unfold leisurely\u2014perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the soothing sound of water kisses the shore while still allowing one to enjoy the serenity of a quiet cityscape. A visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 may unfold, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with thoughts of the day ahead, as the clouds slowly drift, revealing patches of blue and drawing in the day with the promise of hidden vistas yet to be explored.",
