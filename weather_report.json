    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco settles under a cloak of partly cloudy skies, the air cool as the temperature dips towards a gentle 52 degrees. A brisk west wind, sweeping through the streets at 22 mph, carries gusts that dance up to 31 mph, creating a refreshing tang that invigorates the senses. It is a night that calls you to wrap yourself in a light jacket, seeking solace from the briskness, or perhaps enjoying an evening stroll wrapped in the soft embrace of the city, its iconic silhouettes softened by the clouds above.\n\nAs dawn breaks, Friday promises a sun-soaked awakening, where the vibrancy of a clear sky unfolds. The high will flirt with 62 degrees before gracefully tapering off in the afternoon. The winds persist, shifting slightly but maintaining their playful dance at 16 to 25 mph, challenging those who venture outdoors to find balance against their strength. The view looking northeast might reveal the wisps of a marine layer clinging stubbornly to the cliffs, while the golden glow of the sun brings clarity and warmth. Ideal for a leisurely walk through the Embarcadero or a serene moment at a caf\u00e9, the day beckons with subtle charm. Dress in layers, as the warmth of the day and the cool breezes remind us to embrace the rhythm of these San Francisco days.",
