    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, a radiant sun bathes the city under clear skies, promising a high temperature that hovers gracefully around 62 degrees. A lively west-southwest breeze dances through the streets, occasionally punctuated by brisk gusts, inviting those who venture outdoors to feel refreshed. While the warmth may encourage a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment in one of the city's many parks, the ever-present possibility of cooler gusts suggests layering is wise\u2014perhaps a light jacket or a cozy sweater to embrace both sunny and breezy moments alike.\n\nAs evening falls, the clouds will gently roll in, softening the glow of twilight and ushering in a low of 53. This partly cloudy canvas will envelope the city, perfect for a tranquil dining experience at a local eatery or a serene evening walk where you can savor the cool air. The fog may linger at the edges, a gentle reminder of the marine layer that often graces this coastal jewel, but it won't obscure the city's charm. In the spirit of the day, a quiet picnic at Alamo Square or coffee at a sunlit caf\u00e9 could beautifully capture the essence of San Francisco's dynamic tranquility as the day slips into dusk.",
