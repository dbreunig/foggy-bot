    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the sky presents an inviting mix of partial clouds against the backdrop of a gentle southwest breeze, whispering along the streets at a soothing 6 to 9 mph. The air lifts slightly, cooling into a crisp and comfortable embrace around 53 degrees, ideal for a leisurely stroll through the vibrant streets or perhaps a quiet evening spent in the glow of a favorite caf\u00e9. \n\nAs dawn breaks on Friday, the world will awaken to a bright sun, casting warmth and light with a high near 68 degrees that taps into a sense of optimism. Expect the temperatures to drift slightly downwards as the day matures, settling around 66 degrees in the afternoon, complemented by a lively south-southwest wind that may even carry a few playful gusts reaching 23 mph. This weather invites one to don layers\u2014perhaps a light sweatshirt over a t-shirt, ready to shed as the sun climbs higher. With this gentle warmth and clearer skies, the day beckons for a casual exploration\u2014perhaps a peaceful bike ride along the waterfront or a visit to a local park where the laughter of children mingles with the chatter of friends, painting a perfect picture of a leisurely summer day in the city.",
