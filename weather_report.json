    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the air carries a crispness that signals a refreshing shift from the cool grip of night. As the early afternoon sun approaches its zenith, the clouds begin to part, revealing a mostly sunny sky that holds promise for the day ahead. With temperatures set to peek around the pleasant low sixties, the gentle but persistent west wind brings a touch of invigorating chill, a reminder of the city's proximity to the ocean and the whispers of marine layers that linger along the coast.\n\nCurrently, the skyline is cloaked in an ethereal haze where the fog playfully dances, veiling the iconic outlines, yet it is likely to retreat as the sun reveals more of the day. For those venturing out, thoughtful layering is advisable; a light jacket will serve well against the brisk breezes, while underneath, comfortable attire will allow for movement and ease. Perhaps a stroll down to the waterfront or a leisurely walk through one of the city's many parks would be ideal. Take a moment to savor a coffee or pastry at a local caf\u00e9, watching as the city awakens from its misty slumber, a day woven with potential for exploration and quiet pleasures lies ahead.",
