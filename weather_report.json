    "weather_report": "This morning in Downtown San Francisco, the sun greets the day with a warm embrace, casting its light across the city. With clear skies to start, the warmth of the rising sun announces a high near 67 degrees, perfect for a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely coffee stop at your favorite caf\u00e9. As the morning evolves, temperatures will gently dip towards 65, with a southwest breeze carrying the scent of the bay, mingling with the crisp air of the morning. The wind, playful yet steady at about 14 mph and prone to gusts, adds a lively rhythm to the already vibrant atmosphere.\n\nAs the sun sets, enjoy the evening in partly cloudy comfort, with a low expected around 56 degrees. Dressing in layers will allow you to transition seamlessly from the coolness of the evening to the warmth of the day. With the marine layer remaining absent this morning, the iconic views of the Golden Gate shine brightly, inviting you to explore. Perhaps a walk through Golden Gate Park or a quiet moment along Baker Beach might be in order, as the beauty of the day unfolds under a sky that beckons for discovery.",
