    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco today, a light drizzle kissed the streets this morning, a gentle reminder of the marine layer that often drapes itself over the city. As the day unfolds, clouds are giving way to occasional glimpses of sun, although the skies remain largely muted, casting a soft light over the iconic architecture. The temperature hovers around a comfortable 64 degrees, a perfect embrace for those wandering beneath a mix of fluffy whites and silvery grays. You might catch the ribbon of the Golden Gate Bridge peeking through, yet its surrounding fog tells tales of the ever-present ocean breeze, whispering secrets of the bay to those within its reach.\n\nAs the afternoon settles in, the clouds will linger, bringing with them a promise of a cooler tonight, with temperatures sinking to a mild 57 degrees. A light jacket or sweater will keep you snug as you stroll through the streets, whether you choose to savor a quiet afternoon at a caf\u00e9 or explore the vibrant neighborhoods. The occasional gust\u2014up to 20 mph\u2014merely adds to the briskness of the air, making for a refreshing contrast to the warmth of a well-loved cardigan. A sense of calm prevails in this charming coastal city, urging you to embrace the cool weather, perhaps losing yourself in conversation with a friend over coffee, or simply enjoying the moment amidst the layered blues and grays of a San Francisco afternoon.",
