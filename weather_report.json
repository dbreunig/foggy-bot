    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon arrives with a gaze of bright sunlight illuminating the cityscape, though one can sense the playful tease of the marine layer, which hovers just beyond the hills. The temperature hovers comfortably, promising a high near 65, but as afternoon descends, feel the familiar chill creeping back in, with the mercury dipping further to a refreshing 62. The brisk west-southwest wind whispers through the streets, dancing at around 21 mph, occasionally gusting into more robust bursts that playfully tousle hair and rustle loose papers.\n\nAs the day transitions into evening, expect a shift in atmosphere\u2014clouds will gather softly, veiling some of that radiant sunshine, as temperatures settle around 54. The wind, while still present, will reduce its tempo to a gentle flow, inviting you to layer as you go about your evening. The pleasant weather beckons for a brisk walk along the Embarcadero or perhaps a meandering stroll through the Mission District, where the artistic spirit of the city thrives. As you venture out, a light jacket or sweater will serve you well against the cool evening air, allowing you to enjoy the city in its evolving moods without hesitation.",
