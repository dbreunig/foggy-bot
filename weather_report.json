    "weather_report": "In the heart of San Francisco, as the sun begins its descent, the day unveils a serene clarity. The city is basking under the gentle warmth of a summer afternoon, where golden rays kiss the iconic skyline, and the breeze carries a hint of the ocean's salt. The wind dances at a brisk pace, whispering promises of a refreshing evening to come, while the air remains free from any cloying fog that often drapes the city in mystery. The Golden Gate Bridge stands proud and visible, a testament to this clear expanse, offering breathtaking views to those fortunate enough to gaze upon it.\n\nAs twilight approaches, temperatures will gracefully settle around a comforting 52 degrees. This evening, the skies will mostly remain clear, ideal for leisurely strolls along the waterfront, where you might find a small gathering of locals enjoying a glass of wine or watching boats gently glide across the bay. For those venturing out, layering is the key\u2014think light sweaters or jackets to wrap around you as the air turns cooler once the sun bids farewell. Perhaps a quiet evening spent at a charming caf\u00e9, savoring the artisanal flavors of local delights, could be just the thing to embrace the beautiful San Francisco night, where each moment unfolds like a delicate story.",
