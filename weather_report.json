    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night unfolds with a refreshing clarity. The skies, mostly clear, paint a serene backdrop for the settling evening. As temperatures hover in the cool embrace of 49 degrees, a gentle west-northwest breeze begins to whisper through the streets, stirring whispers of the city's vibrant spirit. The moon casts its soft light across the skyline, highlighting the contours of the iconic landscape, inviting passersby to linger in the moment.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the day promises a gracious warmth, peaking near 65 degrees under the bright allure of a sunny sky. With the winds picking up slightly, between 7 to 17 mph, it creates an invigorating atmosphere, perfect for strolling along the Embarcadero or exploring the vibrant market stalls of the Ferry Building. Though the marine layer will linger, creating a subtle breath of fog, its presence is gentle, and the setting will remain pleasantly inviting. Layering a light jacket over a comfortable shirt will be wise, allowing for both comfort and ease as the warmth of the sun beckons. Perhaps consider a slow coffee at a local caf\u00e9 to savor the evolving day or wander where street musicians serenade the breeze, capturing the essence of San Francisco life.",
