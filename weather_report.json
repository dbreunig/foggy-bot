    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the sun casts a gentle warmth over the city, framed by a crisp azure sky. The temperature meanders comfortably, a soothing 66 degrees, accompanied by a playful breeze whispering from the west, rustling through the avenues and inviting pedestrians to bask in the daylight. The city's vibrancy is palpable, with the Golden Gate Bridge standing as a silent sentinel, its silhouette sharp against the clear expanse, tinged only slightly by the remnants of the marine layer lingering in the distance.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the atmosphere will shift to a predominantly cloudy embrace, with temperatures dipping to greet an even 58 degrees. The winds will soften, leaving a gentle sigh in their wake. Dress in layers, perhaps a light sweater or a casual jacket to navigate the transition from the warm, sunlit streets into the cooler evening air. A late stroll along the waterfront or a quiet seat in one of the many outdoor cafes presents an ideal opportunity to savor the lingering tastes of summer, as the city prepares to shift into the inviting calm of night. Embrace the day, relish its moments, and let the simplicity of a warm afternoon give way to the comfort of the evening.",
