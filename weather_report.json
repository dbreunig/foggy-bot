    "weather_report": "This afternoon, Downtown San Francisco invites you to step outside and bask in the warm embrace of sunshine, as the sky unfurls a vivid blue tapestry above. A slight breeze dances along the streets, lending a pleasantly crisp quality to the air. With a high of around 62 degrees, the weather feels refreshingly mild\u2014perfect for a leisurely stroll down Market Street or a quiet moment in one of the city's serene parks, where the newly bloomed flowers seem to nod appreciatively in the gentle wind.\n\nAs evening approaches, a shift awaits; the warmth gradually yields to the cool tide of bay fog. The forecast hints at wisps of mist creeping in after 4 a.m., bringing a soft blanket of tranquility to the night. Expect temperatures to drop to a comfortable 50 degrees, accompanied by a light southwest wind. While the fading light may invite you to tuck into a cozy nook with a good book, the hearty allure of the city still beckons. Consider a relaxed dinner al fresco at a local eatery, where you can savor seasonal dishes while the evening air whispers hints of the ocean. As you step out, layering is wise\u2014a light sweater to fend off the impending chill will keep you snug, allowing for a delightful evening beneath the emerging stars.",
