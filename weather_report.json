    "weather_report": "In the early hours of the morning, Downtown San Francisco sits beneath a predominantly clear sky, with only hints of night retreating softly in the corners. The low temperature skirts around a comfortable 50 degrees, while a gentle southwest breeze stirs softly at about five miles per hour. As the sun unfurls its golden rays across the horizon, we anticipate a blissful day ahead, with temperatures rising to a pleasant 63 degrees under a robust sun and an invigorating south-southwest wind that dances between three and eighteen miles per hour.\n\nThe absence of fog allows the stunning beauty of the city to take center stage; the clarity of the air enhances the sharp edges of the iconic architecture and the distant whispers of the Golden Gate Bridge. With such delightful weather upon us, one might consider a leisurely stroll through the quaint streets lined with eclectic shops and colorful murals, or perhaps a visit to one of the many charming cafes, where the smell of freshly baked goods mingles with the aroma of artisanal coffee. As layers can sometimes be a friend to the coastal chill that may settle in later, a light jacket or sweater would suffice for comfort during the early morning, ensuring readiness for the warming embrace of the day ahead.",
