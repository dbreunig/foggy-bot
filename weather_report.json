    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of early morning, Downtown San Francisco rests under a blanket of moisture-laden clouds, with a hint of drizzle whispering through the still air. The low temperature settles gently around 56 degrees, accompanied by a soft breeze from the west-southwest, stirring the coolness and enhancing the misty charm of this vibrant city. As the day unfolds, a slight chance for more drizzle lingers until late morning, after which the clouds will begin to part, revealing glimpses of sun amid the soft gray. The high will hover near 63, allowing a pleasant warmth to seep through, albeit tempered by the familiar breezy gusts.\n\nAs you step outside, dress wisely; a light jacket or cardigan will be your companion against the early dampness, but as the sun makes its appearance, shedding layers will embrace the day\u2019s mildness. The air carries the ocean\u2019s embrace, tinged with salt and nostalgia, inviting you to wander through hidden alleyways or perhaps to a cozy caf\u00e9 where steaming cups await. With the promise of clearer skies, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront\u2014where the fog tends to linger its fading dance over the bay\u2014could rejuvenate the spirit. The marine layer, retreating towards the coast, offers a perfect backdrop for introspection or simply enjoying the undeniable beauty that this city cradles within its hills.",
