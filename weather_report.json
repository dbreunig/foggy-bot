    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a radiant sun, casting a warm glow over the city as it nears the 70-degree mark. The air feels brisk, with a gentle west wind inspiring a sense of vitality, while the skyline stands clear against a backdrop of azure. In this delightful warmth, the horizon is free from fog's embrace, leaving the Golden Gate Bridge proudly visible, standing sentinel over the bay.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky transitions into a canvas of pastel hues, with subtle clouds beginning to drift into view. The temperatures will settle to a comfortable low around 56 degrees, inviting a sense of coziness. The light breezes will continue, suggesting a light sweater or a light jacket might be wise for those venturing outdoors. This evening is perfect for leisurely strolls along the waterfront, where the shimmering lights of the city begin to reflect on the water, or perhaps enjoying a quiet dinner at a sidewalk cafe, where the ambiance perfectly complements the slowly cooling air.",
