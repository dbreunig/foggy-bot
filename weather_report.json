    "weather_report": "As the clock strikes midnight over Downtown San Francisco, the night cloaks the city in a gentle embrace, offering a mild and mostly cloudy atmosphere, with the temperature dipping pleasantly to a comfortable 57 degrees. The wind whispers softly from the west southwest, carrying a cool breeze that dances through the streets. With dawn approaching, hints of a day that will reveal its charm are already settling in, though for now, the fog is still a gentle presence, shrouding parts of the landscape but not overwhelming the scene.\n\nAs Sunday unfolds, expect a transition to clearer skies and a pleasant warmth that hovers around the mid-60s, perfect for easy strolls or casual outings. The backdrop of blue will entice many to savor the fresh air, though the shifting winds, gusting up to 26 mph, may remind explorers to hold onto their hats. It\u2019s a day that invites relaxation\u2014perhaps consider a leisurely brunch at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, followed by an exploration of local parks or an afternoon spent browsing artisan shops. Dress in layers to enjoy the interplay of warmth and breeze, adding a light jacket for the morning chill. Whether you choose to wander through the neighborhood or find a cozy nook for reading, the day beckons you to relish its delights.",
