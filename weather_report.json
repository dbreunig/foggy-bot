    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a crisp clarity. The sun breaks through a gentle cover of clouds, coaxing temperatures to hover near a pleasing 63 degrees, though they may dip slightly with the advancing hour. A soft breeze from the west-southwest dances through the streets at 16 mph, bringing occasional gusts that remind one of the ocean\u2019s breath. You may notice hints of fog creeping in, especially as the city approaches later hours; the marine layer may brush the edges of the Golden Gate, a familiar sentinel shrouded in its delicate veil.\n\nAs evening lingers, the sky will gradually succumb to a thicker blanket of clouds, with a minor chance of drizzle whispering in around 11 PM. Temperatures will reside comfortably in the mid-50s, perfect for a light jacket or a cozy sweater. This evening invites a gentle stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment in a caf\u00e9, where the day's warmth can be savored in comfort as the city hums softly into the night.",
