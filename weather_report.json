    "weather_report": "Today\u2019s weather in Downtown San Francisco offers a mixture of subtle changes and familiar chill, weaving together a narrative of the late afternoon. The sky is embroidered with a tapestry of clouds, an overcast mantle that casts a muted light across the landscape. Although the sun manages to pierce through on occasion, it is a fleeting spectacle, soon to be eclipsed by the thickening marine layer that drifts in from the bay. As the high teeters around sixty degrees, an invigorating breeze whispers from the west, brushing past at twelve miles per hour, while temperatures are expected to gently descend further into the evening.\n\nAnticipation lingers in the air tonight, hinting at the possibility of rain, with a modest chance emerging after four in the morning. The low will tap at the door of forty-nine degrees, allowing a hint of warmth as it rises slightly through the night. Encounters with the drizzle could be anticipated, so it\u2019s wise to cloak yourself in layers\u2014a light jacket paired with a cozy scarf will offer comfort against the brisk winds. While the clouds and potential rain might lead to a cozy night indoors, consider a leisurely stroll through a neighborhood caf\u00e9, where the refuge of warm drinks and soft conversations awaits. There\u2019s a certain charm in the city\u2019s damp evenings, beckoning for quiet reflection as you explore the hushed streets, where the flickering lights dance in puddles, painting a serene portrait of a fog-kissed evening.",
