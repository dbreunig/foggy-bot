Winds whip from the west, adding a brisk overtone that accentuates the need for a robust jacket. \n\nAs the day wears on, it appears the rain will continue to dominate, with lingering clouds casting a subdued light over the streets. The forecast hints at more wetness, estimated at a quarter to half an inch, transforming the familiar urban landscape into a glistening tableau. For those who venture out, a sturdy umbrella and waterproof footwear will be indispensable\u2014ideal accompaniment for those strolling through the quieter corners of the city or savoring a moment in a cozy caf\u00e9.
