    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere carries whispers of rain, as showers and thunderstorms make their way through the city\u2019s fabric. The clouds hang low, casting a heavy, muted glow over the landscape, turning the familiar skyline into a shadowy silhouette under the watch of gusty winds. As temperatures hover around a brisk 45 degrees, it\u2019s prudent to seek warmth \u2013 perhaps in layered attire, a cozy jacket to fend off the chill, and sturdy footwear to brave the wet streets that may soon glisten with fresh rainfall.\n\nAs dawn approaches tomorrow, the storm will likely ease, giving way to brighter skies and a high near 53 that promises a gentle embrace of sunlight by the afternoon. Nevertheless, expect some lingering clouds that may hint at the earlier storms, with a 70% chance of residual showers before evening. While the clarity may not be pristine, it will certainly be refreshingly crisp, perfect for a midday stroll through the city or a visit to a favorite caf\u00e9. Perhaps take the long way home through a neighborhood park, where the earthy scent of rain-soaked grass lingers in the air, or lose yourself in a captivating book at a quaint bookstore, finding solace in both the words and the moment.",
