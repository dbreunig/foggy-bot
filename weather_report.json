    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the night, Downtown San Francisco rests beneath a canopy of clouds, with a whisper of a northwest wind lightly brushing past. The temperature cools to a crisp 46, a reminder of the city's ever-changing moods. This evening, the haze blankets the bay, suggesting a delicate marine layer just beyond the horizon. As morning dawns on Monday, expect the sun to break through the clouds, offering a touch of brightness around 63 degrees, though a gentle descent into the 60s will follow, as if the day is shy to fully embrace the warmth.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the sky will gradually yield to patches of blue, inviting those willing to explore. Dress in layers to appreciate the warmth of midday while preparing for a cool breeze, particularly as gusts may sweep through nature's pathways. Consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront; the quiet reflection of the bay, intertwined with the soft rustling of sea grass, beckons calm moments. The shifting light dancing across the skyline provides a picturesque backdrop for a visit to a charming caf\u00e9 or a simple conversation with a friend, wrapped in the enveloping tranquility of this urban escape.",
