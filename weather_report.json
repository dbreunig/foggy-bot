The day promises a high near 60, perfect for leisurely pursuits. Dressing in layers would serve you well; a light jacket and perhaps a cozy scarf will defend against the evening's coolness and the playful breeze. Activities abound in this luminous weather\u2014consider a quiet walk through the Mission's vibrant murals or savoring a coffee al fresco on a sunlit patio, where the daily rhythm of life unfolds gently before you. Enjoying the outdoors will surely be a delightful way to embrace the city's many facets this weekend.",
