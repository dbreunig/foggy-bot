    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the evidence of a coastal influence lingers like an unfinished thought. The horizon is painted with soft hues, yet hints of the persistent marine layer linger, curling like whispers around the Golden Gate. Tonight, the air carries a gentle breeze from the west, and while it remains partly cloudy, the cooling temperatures promise a comforting embrace as they drop towards 52 degrees.\n\nTomorrow brings a sunlit clarity, a joyful invitation to step outdoors under a brilliant blue expanse. Highs around 69 sweep the chill away, yet this is a city where layers reign supreme. Consider a light jacket for the early morning and evening, and as the sun climbs higher, t-shirts linger beneath that versatile shell. With winds playing at 9 to 20 mph, perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero would be fitting\u2014watching the ferries dance across the bay, enjoying a coffee at one of the bustling caf\u00e9s, or simply inhaling the salty air from a quiet bench. It is a weekend poised for engaging with the city's charm, an opportunity to explore or to unwind in the company of good friends or a beloved book, all beneath San Francisco\u2019s ever-watchful sky.",
