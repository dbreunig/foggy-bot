    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, the evening air carries a refreshing coolness, a gentle reminder of the city\u2019s unexpected charms. The sky, adorned with wisps of clouds, creates a canvas where the golden sun prepares to bid farewell. Currently, temperatures linger around a pleasant 54 degrees, inviting a light sweater wrapped round shoulders for those venturing outdoors. The west-southwest breeze, playful at eight miles per hour, dances through the streets, offering a crisp relief during this early spring evening.\n\nLooking ahead, Wednesday promises a shift, heralding the possibility of rain as the day progresses. Margins of sunlight may linger, but foreboding clouds are expected to roll in after 5 p.m., cloaking the city in gray. The high will reach near 62, ultimately compelling one to adapt. Thus, attire with layers becomes sage advice, a light jacket or a raincoat close at hand for unexpected showers. While the day is partly sunny, the likelihood of precipitation rests patiently at 40%. Given the conditions, it may be an ideal time for a leisurely stroll through the local parks or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where one might sip on an artisan coffee, indulging in the rhythm of the city as it prepares for the day's transition into night.",
