    "weather_report": "As evening falls upon Downtown San Francisco, the air feels crisp, presenting a mixture of clarity and the signature fog that the city occasionally wears like a shroud. The sun, now just a memory hovering on the horizon, has gifted a mostly sunny afternoon that has eased into a gentle coolness. Currently, the temperature hovers around a modest fifty-eight degrees, while a whispering westward wind dances around fourteen miles per hour, a brisk yet familiar companion for those traversing the city.\n\nTonight, the clouds gather to weave a tapestry of gray, hinting at the possibility of rain after the stroke of four in the morning. With a low around forty-nine, the chill may coax you into a cozy sweater or light jacket as you stroll through the less populated streets or find a quiet corner in a favorite caf\u00e9. The promise of a 30% chance of precipitation brings with it an invitation to linger in indoor spaces where warmth and comfort reign. As twilight deepens, consider unwinding with an evening stroll through the quieter neighborhoods, or perhaps indulging in a low-key dinner at a local eatery. Despite the chance of rain, the evening glows with the kind of anticipation that only a city like San Francisco can inspire.",
