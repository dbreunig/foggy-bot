    "weather_report": "Beneath a canopy of somber clouds, Downtown San Francisco stands at the cusp of evening, where a cool breeze whispers promises of spring. The air carries that familiar crispness, hinting at the gentle warmth of a day that has, just moments ago, begun to recede. Tonight\u2019s low of around 54 invites layers\u2014think cozy sweaters and light scarves, perfect for staving off the encroaching chill as the sun bids farewell.\n\nAs Friday looms ahead, expect a canvas painted with shades of gray and glimpses of blue, with temperatures flirting with 64 before dipping slightly. The west winds, dancing at a modest pace, may stir the scattered clouds, allowing occasional rays of sunshine to pierce through, illuminating the streets in a soft glow. The marine layer hangs near the coast, breathing just enough mist into the late afternoon to soften the outlines of the iconic skyline. \n\nA walk through the twisting streets is recommended tonight, perhaps a leisurely stroll among the familiar haunts of the Embarcadero, where the breeze carries the distant laughter of nearby cafes. The modest chill calls for light jackets as the shadows grow longer, providing one with an opportunity to embrace the city\u2019s tranquil charm, wrapped in the rich tapestry of twilight.",
