    "weather_report": "As the evening drapes itself over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity settles in, painting the city with a serene calm. The temperatures gracefully descend to around 56 degrees, accompanied by a faint breeze from the northwest that whispers through the streets, gusting softly at times. Though the night sky is clear, revealing the quiet star-studded expanse overhead, the lingering chill beckons for a light jacket, perhaps layered over a cozy sweater, ensuring comfort against the slight chill that descends as midnight approaches.\n\nTomorrow heralds a vibrant morning, where the sun will rise unshackled by clouds, pushing the day's high to a delightful 74 degrees. Such inviting weather encourages leisurely explorations; perhaps a stroll along the waterfront or a meander through the city's treasured parks would be best. With the wind remaining modest, the golden hues of the sun will enhance the colors of the blooming flowers and the bustling life of the city, inviting both residents and visitors to savor all that San Francisco delicately offers. In this interplay of warmth and nature\u2019s beauty, simple pleasures await those willing to step outside and immerse themselves in the day.",
