    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle caress of sunshine, casting a warm glow across the city\u2019s iconic skyline. A mild breeze orchestrates a playful dance among the leaves, hinting at the shifting seasons as temperatures hover comfortably near 67 degrees. Yet, as the day wears on, a subtle shift beckons, promising a dip into the cooler embrace of the evening with falling temperatures. \n\nAs night approaches, anticipation swells for the slight chance of drizzle after 11 PM, a whisper of moisture that will mingle with the clouds gathering above. The sky, mostly cloudy, envelops the city in a veil, while gusty winds offer both rhythm and refreshment. For those venturing outside, layering is wise; a light jacket or sweater will soften the chill as the evening settles in. Walking along the waterfront or finding a cozy caf\u00e9 to enjoy a cup of coffee can be delightful pursuits on this softly turning day, where the elements converge in a delicate balance of warmth and coolness.",
