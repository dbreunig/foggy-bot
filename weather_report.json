    "weather_report": "The night has cast a shroud of rain and clouds over Downtown San Francisco, the damp and fragrant air hinting at the morning's expected downpour. As the city sleeps, the brisk southeast winds whip through the streets, rustling the leaves and whispering tales of the approaching showers. In the hours before dawn, the temperature hovers just above fifty, a mild chill that welcomes a cozy wrap of layers. The sky is thick, obscuring familiar landmarks, yet evocative of a city that thrives amidst its own mystique.\n\nAs Sunday awakens, the promise of rain lingers. Showers shall grace the day, tapering off by late afternoon, and the ever-present wind will whip through the areas, brisk and invigorating. The atmosphere is beset with thick clouds, muting the skyline but providing a soft and contemplative glow. Clarity is notably limited, with fog subtly wrapping around the Golden Gate Bridge and hinting at the hidden bay. It\u2019s a day best suited for slippers and soft sweaters \u2014 a chance to savor warm sips of tea or coffee indoors, perhaps while flipping through pages of a captivating book or catching up on a film long-awaited. The afternoon beckons for brief walks between showers, umbrellas in hand, or visits to local cafes where warmth and conversation collide, making the most of a day tempered with the gentle rhythms of the rain.",
