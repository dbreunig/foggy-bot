    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco under a canvas of gentle blue interspersed with soft clouds, lending a pleasant brightness to the landscape. The lingering chill from the ocean lingers in the air, yet the temperature dances around 64, coaxing people outside to relish the mild weather. It feels like the city is taking a deep breath, pausing for a moment between the brisk winds and the subtle promise of a cooler evening. As the hours pass, temperatures will gracefully settle around 61, a prelude to the impending slight chance of rain after nightfall. \n\nWith a whisper of wind from the southwest, the atmosphere invites a light jacket or a cozy sweater \u2014 a perfect choice for those wandering the streets. As evening approaches, the clouds will knit together in a cozy embrace, obscuring the sky yet leaving the spirit of the day bright. An errant drizzle may flirt with the city post-11 PM, but for now, the narrow streets and famed bridges beckon with the allure of urban exploration. Perhaps a stroll through nearby parks or a quiet caf\u00e9 to savor an afternoon treat would be the day's perfect punctuation as twilight approaches.",
