The air is crisp, with a refreshing chill that rounds the edges of the morning. The forecast promises a shift as the day progresses toward a brighter canvas, with the sun making its anticipated appearance, revealing the city's iconic landmarks under a veil of blue. By afternoon, temperatures will find a delicate balance around the low sixties, while the west wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it the salt-tinged essence of the bay.\n\nThe morning may still cloak parts of the coast in fleeting fog\u2014an ethereal reminder of the city's maritime nature, but as the sun rises higher, that fog will retreat, allowing more of the city to bask in warmth. In these transitional hours, a light jacket or a cozy sweater might be wise, perfect for wrapping up against the cool breeze. As the day unfolds, an inviting walk along the waterfront or a leisurely exploration of one of the local cafes could offer just the right blend of tranquility and energy, where one can savor a cup of coffee while contemplating the artistry of the sun breaking through.",
