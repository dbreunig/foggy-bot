    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city is wrapped in a hushed embrace of rain-soaked tranquility. The air is crisp and carries the unmistakable scent of wet pavement mingling with the briny breath of the Pacific. With a low lingering around fifty, it feels more refreshing than cold, yet one should tuck themselves into a light jacket to fend off the briskness. The clouds above, heavy with the promise of moisture, whisper of rain to come, a gentle lullaby that cradles the early morning.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the gray skies to weep intermittently, with showers and the possibility of thunder gracing the hours until mid-afternoon. The wind, lively and charged at 12 to 20 mph, flirts with the trees, making them dance and swirl. Visibility is diminished, with fog creeping in around the edges and casting a soft veil over the iconic landmarks, including the Golden Gate Bridge, suggesting a perfect day for introspection or a moment lost in a good book at a cozy caf\u00e9. This isn\u2019t a day for grand adventures; instead, embrace the quietude it brings. Savour the small pleasures, whether it\u2019s strolling beneath a brolly between breaks in the rain, or finding solace in the warmth of a local bakery. Stay curious, stay warm, and let the rhythm of the rain accompany your day.",
