    "weather_report": "A soft warmth blankets Downtown San Francisco this morning, hinting at a day that walks the fine line between warmth and coolness. The sky unfolds in a gentle expanse of blue, painted with wisps of cloud that drift lazily overhead, suggesting the promise of a mostly sunny afternoon. As the sun rises higher, it casts its golden hues over the city, illuminating landmarks and streets, yet one can\u2019t help but notice the faint trace of fog creeping towards the edges of the bay\u2014an ever-present character that dances around the iconic Golden Gate Bridge like a ghost.\n\nThis day invites a light approach to clothing. A simple jacket should suffice against the slight chill that lingers in the shadows, especially as temperatures slowly retreat from their highs. With the air crisp yet inviting, consider meandering through the local parks or joining a friend for coffee at one of the many charming caf\u00e9s. The atmosphere courts a lighthearted pace\u2014perfect for a stroll along the waterfront, where the fresh breeze mingles with the collective hum of a waking city. Embrace the day\u2019s warmth and its gentle nuances, as they reveal a San Francisco that's both familiar and refreshingly alive.",
