    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the evening reveals a mostly clear sky, graced by soft breezes from the west-northwest. The air carries a fresh chill, with temperatures dipping to a pleasant low of around 46 degrees. Perfectly framed by the outlines of iconic structures like the Golden Gate Bridge, the view is unmarred by the usual coastal fog, offering a rare privilege of clarity that invites contemplation and strolls along the waterfront or through the quiet streets.\n\nTomorrow promises to continue this lovely trend, as the sun takes center stage throughout the daytime, warming the city to a soft peak of 60 degrees. It's a comfortable range that suggests layering would be wise\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket over a casual tee, ideal for both the gentle morning coolness and the afternoon warmth. As you consider the day ahead, think of leisurely pursuits like visiting a quaint caf\u00e9 for a warm drink or journaling in one of the city\u2019s parks, where the golden light dances through budding leaves. Embrace the serenity that these clear skies bestow upon the day.",
