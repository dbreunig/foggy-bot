The skies are partly cloudy, ensuring that starlight adorns the backdrop, while temperatures hover around a comfortable 52 degrees. The west wind, a mere whisper at 5 mph, carries with it the scents of the ocean and the promise of a clear morning to come.\n\nFriday dawns with expectations of part sunshine, with the day\u2019s high creeping near a mild 65 before settling into a cooler embrace of 61 in the afternoon. Though there may be a hazy marine layer lingering near the coastline\u2014typical for this enchanting city\u2014expect much of the day to be inviting as the sun breaks through, offering gentle warmth without undue humidity. Consider layering light sweaters or jackets as you venture outside, allowing for comfort while wandering through the urban tapestry. With the time slipping towards twilight, this weekend carries the scent of possibility; stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps, or clasp a warm beverage and sit in one of the city\u2019s quieter parks, where the symphony of evening settles around you.",
