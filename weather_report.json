    "weather_report": "As dusk descends on Downtown San Francisco, a delicate mist encroaches, carrying with it the scent of brine from the bay and whispers of the coming night. Presently, the sky holds a shroud of clouds, casting a muted light over the city, and a gentle breeze rustles the trees as it sweeps down from the west. Drizzle may greet the late-night wanderer after 11 PM, yet for now, the atmosphere remains laden with potential, clouded but not entirely dreary. With temperatures around 56 degrees, dressing in layers will be wise; a light jacket will ward off the chill, complemented by comfortable shoes for an evening stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a cozy corner caf\u00e9 where one can sip warm beverages while watching the evening unfold.\n\nTomorrow brings a hint of brightness, albeit still understated. The chance of drizzle lingers gently into the early hours, but by mid-morning, the sun may peek through in a playful dance with the clouds, leading to a high near 64 degrees in the afternoon. People might find joy in leisurely afternoon strolls through the parks, enjoying the partly sunny skies as temperatures begin to slip slightly. San Francisco\u2019s quirky character invites one to explore the neighborhood bookshops, delight in a local eatery, or take a quiet moment in one of its many gardens, reveling in the unusual charm that each gray cloud brings\u2014a reminder that even in the fog, beauty resides.",
