    "weather_report": "A typical night in Downtown San Francisco whispers of a gentle fog, draping itself over the city, as the allure of the Golden Gate Bridge is softened by the night air. Currently, the temperatures linger around a cool 49 degrees, punctuated by a light breeze from the west, making the air feel refreshing yet a hint subdued. As dawn approaches, the fog will begin to lift, revealing the golden hues of a partly cloudy sky\u2014a promise of a more enlightened day ahead. \n\nCome Sunday, the mist will retreat, giving way to patches of sunlight that will grace the city in the late morning. Temperatures will reach a comfortable 66 degrees, before settling a bit cooler as the afternoon unfolds. While there is a lingering softness from the marine layer, the warmth of the sun beckons you to shed those heavier layers. Consider donning a light sweater or a long-sleeve shirt early in the day, perfect for wandering through local caf\u00e9s and perhaps enjoying breakfast al fresco. As the sun rises higher, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a weekend market would feel particularly rewarding. Whether it\u2019s savoring the smell of freshly brewed coffee or indulging in local pastries, the day holds quiet possibilities to embrace the unique charm of San Francisco.",
