    "weather_report": "As morning unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle drizzle dances on the air, shrouding the city in a delicate veil of cloudiness. The low ceiling offers a hint of mystery, the sort that invites contemplation as the world gradually awakens. A whisper of west-southwest winds stirs, bringing with it the refreshing promise of change, albeit under the muted warmth of a mild 58 degrees. Although sunlight may peek through later, the allure of fog still lingers\u2014a soft embrace from the ocean's edge, while the Golden Gate Bridge stands as a sentinel, partially obscured yet undeniably majestic.\n\nAs the day progresses, patchy drizzle is forecasted to give way to moments of sun, warming into a modest 66 degrees before softly retreating to 64 as the afternoon wraps around the city. The air remains crisp and invigorating, perfect for layered attire\u2014perhaps a light sweater topped with a windbreaker, offering comfort against both chill and breeze. With the conditions leaning toward the scenic rather than the extraordinary, it would be a splendid time for a stroll along the waterfront. One might savor a quiet cup of coffee at a favorite caf\u00e9, observing the ebb and flow of city life, or meander through local art galleries that thrive in the embrace of fog\u2014each moment rich with the quiet charm characteristic of San Francisco days.",
