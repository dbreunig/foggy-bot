The sky is partly cloudy, draping a delicate veil that hints at the crispness of the night to come. With temperatures likely dipping towards the low fifties, a brisk west-southwest wind dances through the streets, reminding you of the ocean\u2019s presence just beyond the city limits. \n\nTomorrow promises a brighter perspective, as mostly sunny skies unfurl with a high near sixty-six, gradually softening to a mid-afternoon lull at sixty-four. While the gusts may taper, the presence of that subtle marine layer accentuates the day\u2019s character, adding a touch of serenity that one can grasp. The clarity looks inviting, urging residents to step out and savor the unfolding possibilities. Casual layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket or scarf\u2014will allow one to embrace the coastal chill without a hint of discomfort. As the sun sinks lower, it\u2019s an opportune time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the bustling energy of the city fades into a tranquil hum as it wraps itself in the cloak of night.",
