    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sun beams down with a gentle warmth, casting vivid shadows across the iconic streets. With a current high gently nudging 67 degrees, it feels almost balmy under the clear, blue sky. A brisk west-southwest wind sweeps through at 14 mph, dancing playfully among the rooftops and signaling any nearby fog to keep its distance. The promise of pleasantness hangs in the air, dotted by gusts that flicker like whispers, urging you to step outside and embrace the day.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clarity of the day will shift to a softer, more contemplative scene. The temperature will dip to around a calm 56 degrees, inviting you to cozy up a bit. The partly cloudy skies coax the last rays of sunlight into retirement, a fitting end to a lovely summer day. With a light jacket or a sweater, you\u2019ll be perfectly dressed for an evening stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 where warm aromas entice passersby. As the night falls, the wind will settle, allowing the city to breathe and hum in its own melodic rhythm, inviting you to savor every moment of this urban escapade.",
