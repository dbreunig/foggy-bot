    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfurls with a gentle promise of sunshine filtering through the day, dancing around the peaks of the city. At this hour, the warmth of 64 degrees embraces the air, but as the afternoon approaches, a coolness will overlay the warmth, settling around 61 in a soft sigh. A southwest breeze, barely a whisper at 5 to 10 miles per hour, meanders through the streets, adding a refreshing note, ideal for a brisk stroll or enjoying a moment outdoors. Yet, as night creeps in, a slight chance of drizzle may sweep through after midnight, hinting at a more contemplative closure to the day.\n\nThe visibility appears clear for now, but there's a subtle suggestion of the lingering marine layer just beyond the horizon, a hint of fog that may roll in later. Dressed in layers, a lightweight jacket will suit you as you venture out, perfect for those crisp oceanic breezes and the potential for evening chill. The unfolding day beckons one to explore the quiet corners of the city or engage with its vibrant caf\u00e9s, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the gentle sound of conversation. It\u2019s a day tailored for leisurely discoveries, allowing the spirit of San Francisco to wrap you in its enchanting embrace, promising a delicate balance of warmth and coolness.",
