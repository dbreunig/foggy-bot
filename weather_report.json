    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sky stretches wide and clear, adorned with a painted canvas of blue that invites optimism. The air is crisp, hinting at the warmth to come as the day reaches for a high of around 65, gently falling toward a more temperate 60 by afternoon. Breezes from the northwest whisper softly as they traverse the streets, creating a serene atmosphere, ideal for strolling or finding a comfortable nook in a cafe.\n\nAs evening approaches, a soft veil of clouds will appear, cooling things to a cozy 50. With this in mind, a light jacket would serve well against the evening chill. The absence of fog presents an exceptional opportunity to embrace the city\u2019s charm; perhaps one could enjoy a leisurely walk through the Presidio, relishing the vivid hues of the day as they fade into twilight, or linger over a tempered glass of wine while watching the dusky sky transform. Engaging in these simple pleasures today seems perfectly aligned with the weather's grace.",
