    "weather_report": "As twilight descends on Downtown San Francisco, the city wraps itself in a delicate veil of clouds, hinting at the gentle embrace of a mild coastal evening. The air, eased by a soft west-southwest breeze, carries a delightful chill, perfect for a contemplative stroll along the waterfront or a quiet evening in a favorite nook with a good book. With the temperature creeping down to a comfortable 53 degrees, a light jacket or cardigan would pair well with the chill, offering just the right touch of warmth without stifling comfort.\n\nLooking toward Independence Day, the promise of a bright sunny day beckons, though the afternoon may see temperatures hemmed in by coastal breezes, tapering off to around 60. The typical San Francisco play of sun and fog will play out, with the morning likely welcoming a marine layer that may linger just long enough to add a hint of drama to the otherwise clear day. As you plan your activities, consider taking a leisurely walk to explore Union Square or enjoying a coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, where you can relish the cool breeze while the sun makes a tentative entrance. The weather holds great potential, inviting you to appreciate the vibrant pulse of the city while being gently reminded of the unique charm that only San Francisco can provide.",
