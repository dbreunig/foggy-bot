    "weather_report": "As the dawn light breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the skyline comes to life beneath a veil of clear skies, holding promise in its gentle warmth. Today, the city will bask in sunshine, with temperatures hovering near a comfortable sixty degrees before the afternoon brings a subtle drop to fifty-seven. A light southwest breeze stirs, adding a splash of life to the tranquility, while whispers of stronger gusts tease at the excitement of a day ahead. Yet as night approaches, the atmosphere turns, signaling rain that will sweep in after eleven, casting the cozy city into a shroud of clouds. \n\nThe morning presents a splendid opportunity for a leisurely stroll through the Mission District, perhaps indulging in a quiet breakfast at a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh pastries dances in the air. Dress in layers, perhaps a light sweater or a stylish jacket, ready to embrace both the morning sun and the evening's impending moisture. As the shadows lengthen and raindrops begin to fall later on, consider retreating to a dimly lit bistro, where the clinking of glasses and the laughter of friends may create cheerful company against the backdrop of a rainy San Francisco evening.",
