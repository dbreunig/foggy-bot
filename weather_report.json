    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun casts a warm glow amid a gentle drift of clouds, offering a brief reprieve from the more familiar fog. The temperature hovers comfortably, a quality that calls for light layers\u2014perhaps a breezy shirt hugged by a light cardigan\u2014ideal for navigating the day's pleasant warmth and slightly brisk wind. The west-southwest breeze, lively yet soothing, enhances the brightness while lifting spirits high, presenting an invitation to wander the city\u2019s charming streets.\n\nAs the day evolves into evening, a veil of cloudiness will grace the horizon, softening the vibrant hues that often characterize the sunset. The air will cool as the sun dips, hinting at the arrival of a cooler and more tranquil night. Ideal activities might include browsing a local bookstore, finding comfort in a leisurely coffee shop, or indulging in an intimate dinner with friends where laughter can echo above the calmness. With little chance of fog in the immediate area, tonight promises a peacefulness, ideal for contemplative walks along the waterfront to soak in the quiet beauty of the illuminated skyline.",
