    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco awakens to a mostly sunny morning, where the horizon shines with promise, albeit circumscribed by wisps of marine fog eager to creep back as the day unfolds. With temperatures commencing at a gentle 65 degrees, there\u2019s a comforting warmth that is destined to yield to a softer afternoon coolness, retreating to around 62. The west-southwest breeze, devoid of urgency, brushes lightly across the landscape at a nimble 6 to 14 mph, punctuated by occasional gusts that add a pleasant spontaneity to the air.\n\nCome evening, shadows will elongate as clouds gather, drawing a quilt of gray over the homes and bustling streets, dipping temperatures to a cozy 55. The evening promises a mellow luster, inviting one to don a light jacket or cardigan, ideal for a stroll through the neighborhoods, perhaps indulging in dinner at a quaint bistro or a leisurely visit to the local bookshop, where endless stories await their chooser. Today\u2019s conditions are optimal for light layers, perfect for daydreaming in the park or navigating the winding alleys filled with the scent of fresh coffee and baked pastries. Embrace the beauty of this day, for it is yet another splendid chapter in the ever-evolving story of this storied city.",
