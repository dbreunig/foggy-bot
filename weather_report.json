    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the city lies beneath a mostly cloudy veil, a soft, muted energy flowing through the streets. The temperature is mild, cradling the evening at around 51 degrees. A gentle west wind rustles the leaves, barely making its presence known as it slips between buildings. The clouds, like a painter\u2019s palette, provide a tranquil backdrop, leaving hints of the city\u2019s lights to shimmer like distant stars. \n\nFor Tuesday, expect a transformation as the sun breaks free, casting a warm glow upon the skyline and lifting spirits. The forecast promises a daytime high near 62, inviting folks to shed their layers and embrace the clarity to come. While the fog may still linger in the corners of the bay, the day ahead looks favorable for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a coffee break at a local caf\u00e9, where one can savor the awakening city. Given the transition from cool to warmth, light layers would be wise, perhaps a light jacket for the early morning chill before the sunshine takes charge. Embrace this day\u2014there is much to be experienced in the heart of the city.",
