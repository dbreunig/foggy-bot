    "weather_report": "As the early morning hours linger in Downtown San Francisco, the air is wrapped in a cloak of soft clouds, hinting at the night\u2019s gentle embrace. The temperature rests comfortably around 53 degrees, accompanied by a light breeze whispering from the west. That same breeze anticipates a dynamic shift as the day unfolds, suggesting that the sun, bold and determined, will break through the somber cloud cover. \n\nBy midday, the city will greet a warmth of about 62 degrees, with the sun casting its golden glow on the iconic skyline. Many locals may find themselves exchanging their heavier jackets for lighter layers, an invitation to bask in the pleasant outdoors. While the infamous fog may linger in the distance, hinting at the coast, it is likely to recede, affording the city a clearer vista as the day matures. With the forecasted winds lending a refreshingly spirited edge, today is ideal for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, a sip of coffee at a cozy caf\u00e9, or perhaps a meandering visit to one of the many parks. As you soak in this fleeting moment of springtime ease, consider donning a light sweater or shawl, perfect for those gentle gusts while you relish the invigorating charm of this vibrant city.",
