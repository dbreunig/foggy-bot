The marine layer appears to skim the coastline, wrapping around the Golden Gate Bridge in a cozy, ethereal fog, while the city remains distinct\u2014a gentle reminder of the distinctive beauty California offers. A light jacket or a cozy sweater would be prudent, allowing comfort against the evening chill.\n\nToday beckons a stroll through one of the city\u2019s storied neighborhoods, perhaps North Beach with its vibrant cafe culture, or along the Embarcadero, where the rhythmic lapping of bay waters creates an inviting atmosphere.
