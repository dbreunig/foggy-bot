Tonight\u2019s temperatures will ease to a comfortable low around 46 degrees, while a gentle southwest breeze might barely rustle the leaves of the street-side palms. Under the vast expanse of the night sky, twinkling lights punctuate the serene atmosphere, offering a soothing contrast to the cool air. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, a sunny disposition awaits. With daytime highs reaching near 60 degrees, warmth will envelop the city, though it will gradually cool to around 58 by afternoon. The soft south winds will whisper through the neighborhoods, inviting residents to relish the day outdoors. With the forecast favoring clear skies, now is the time for leisurely strolls through Golden Gate Park or a visit to one of the waterfront cafes, where one can enjoy a warm drink while marveling at the shimmering bay. In this revelatory weather, a light jacket or a cozy sweater will suffice, wrapping you in comfort as you embrace the unfolding joy of the day ahead.",
