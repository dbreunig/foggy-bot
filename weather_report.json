With the temperature resting at a mild 59 degrees, the air feels cool yet inviting, a gentle embrace cradling those who emerge from the nighttime cocoon. The soft south-southwest winds whisper at a leisurely pace, hinting at the promise of a brighter day ahead. \n\nBy midday, the skies will shed their overcast layers in favor of sunny spells, with a high reaching near 78 degrees before easing back to a comfortable 73 in the afternoon. The marine layer, resting gently along the horizon, will retreat, revealing more of the city\u2019s iconic silhouette against an expansive, clear blue. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity to don light layers\u2014a breathable shirt complemented by a light jacket for the lingering chill of the morning. Perhaps a stroll through the Presidio will entice, where the paths beckon with the fragrance of coastal flora and the distant sound of waves crashing against the shore. A visit to one of the local coffee shops, relishing a warm cup as you watch the world awaken, could also make for a charming interlude.",
