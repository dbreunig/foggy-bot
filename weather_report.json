    "weather_report": "As daylight breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the sun peeks over the horizon, casting a warm glow onto the skyline. The air is refreshingly crisp, each breath tinged with the untouched essence of dawn. The weather promises to remain kind throughout the day, with sunny skies and a gentle breeze\u2014a perfect setting for those who appreciate a quieter morning pace as temperatures seek comfort in the mid-60s. There\u2019s a light west-southwest wind, coaxing the murmurs of the city into a soft rustle, while the faintest whisper of a marine layer hugs the edges of the bay, surrendering to the sun's embrace.\n\nFor today, one might choose to wear layers, a light jacket suitable for the brisk morning and a t-shirt for the pleasant afternoon. It\u2019s an excellent time to explore the neighborhoods, perhaps wandering through the charming streets of the Mission or enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee at an outdoor cafe, where the sun can warm your face as it holds court in the sky. As evening falls, when temperatures drop to a cozy 50, transitioning to a quiet night illuminated by stars seems the perfect end to a day spent embracing the beauty of this vibrant city.",
