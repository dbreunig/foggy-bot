    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a tapestry of clouds blankets the sky, muted in shades of grey, setting a tranquil atmosphere. The air, tinged with the cool embrace of coastal winds, carries with it the promise of change as gusts swirl briskly, refreshing yet unwavering. With the mercury dipping to a comfortable low of around 54, a light jacket would serve you well should you dare to wander into the night, perhaps to savor the city's vibrant nightlife or simply to inhale the salty scent of the bay.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the forecast beckons a transformation, inviting glimpses of sunlight to filter through those lingering clouds. The day ahead hints at a gentle warmth, nudging toward the mid-sixties, while a breeze continues to playfully dance across the landscape. The vibrant hues of the city\u2019s iconic architecture will gradually emerge from their slumber, gleaming under the calls of a soft yet lively wind. There\u2019s a chance the marine layer might cloak the distant shoreline, but fear not; even if the fog tumbles lazily in during the morning hours, it will quickly surrender to bursts of daylight by noon. This in-between weather offers a perfect opportunity to slip into something light yet layered\u2014a cozy sweater over a breathable shirt\u2014ideal for a jaunt through Golden Gate Park, browsing the artisanal shops of Haight Street, or enjoying a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9s, all touched by the distinct charm of a San Francisco afternoon.",
