    "weather_report": "The evening air in Downtown San Francisco carries a gentle breeze, bringing with it a refreshing chill that whispers of the seaside. As night falls, the sky has cleared to reveal a tapestry of stars twinkling against the deepening blue, a promise of brighter days to come. With temperatures hovering around a mild 54 degrees, one feels comfortable with a light jacket or a cozy sweater wrapped around the shoulders. A stroll along the waterfront would be an inviting option, as the rhythmic sound of waves provides a soothing soundtrack to the backdrop of city lights.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the sun will rise to reveal a world bathed in golden warmth, promising a high of 65 degrees. The gentle west-southwest winds will be a constant presence, a reminder of the Pacific just beyond the hills, and it's wise to keep that light jacket handy for the initial chill of the morning. Fog may linger just off the coast, embracing the Golden Gate Bridge with an ephemeral kiss, but that will only add to the haunting beauty of the landscape. Given these delightful conditions, consider visiting a local caf\u00e9 for a leisurely coffee in the morning light, or perhaps take a stroll through one of the city\u2019s many parks, soaking in the tranquility that accompanies such clear, sunny weather.",
