    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks gently over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a refreshing crispness, little more than whispers of the night's chill still lingering. Currently, the skies are mostly clear, offering a broad canvas of blue that heralds a sunlit Labor Day filled with promise. Temperatures will rise to a comfortable 74 degrees, allowing for a pleasant warmth that beckons exploration. While there are hints of the marine layer teasing the edges, it appears less encumbering today, leaving most of the city basking under the sun's gentle embrace. \n\nDressing in light layers is advisable; perhaps a long-sleeved shirt or light jacket for the morning's cooler moments, shedding it as the day unfolds and warmth takes hold. The crispness of the breeze whispers of the West, inviting one to wander through the vibrant parks or embark on a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero. Given the gentle winds and the charming clarity of the day, it is a splendid time to bask in the view of iconic landmarks, or perhaps indulge in a local caf\u00e9\u2019s offerings while sunbathing in a nearby plaza, soaking in the urban rhythm that is quintessentially San Francisco.",
