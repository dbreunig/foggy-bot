    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the sun hangs high in a sky adorned with wisps of clouds, casting a soft glow over the city\u2019s iconic silhouette. With temperatures hovering near a comfortable 66 degrees, the atmosphere feels fresh, kissed by a gentle west-southwest breeze that picks up quietly, swirling through the streets and offering a hint of vigor. The day unfurls with a mostly sunny disposition, promising a gradual retreat to around 64 as afternoon advances, and an anticipated clear evening, settling into the low 40s. \n\nAs you wander through the urban landscape, you may catch glimpses of the marine layer teasing the edges of the iconic Golden Gate, a faint mist playing coy against the rugged coastline, lending a serene charm to the bustling city below. It\u2019s a day best suited for light layers; a light jacket or cardigan will serve you well against the wind\u2019s playful nips. It\u2019s a wonderful opportunity to savor a leisurely stroll, perhaps meandering through the labyrinthine streets or stopping to enjoy a quiet coffee at a sun-drenched caf\u00e9 patio. The air is alive, hinting at the vibrancy of spring\u2014moments worth capturing in your memory, as the city embraces both clarity and gentle whispers of the sea.",
