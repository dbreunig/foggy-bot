    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds graces the skyline, offering a whisper of the enchanting day to come. The crisp air, holding a low gentle note of 59 degrees, feels invigorating against the skin. Though the sun has yet to fully embrace the city, its promise hangs heavily in the air, undeterred by a light breeze sweeping in from the west. Throughout the early hours, San Francisco finds itself basking in a modest obscurity, a brief pause before revealing the golden warmth of afternoon.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the sun will climb steadily, stepping confidently into a high of 75 degrees, before settling into the mid-70s with the afternoon. For those heading out, a light sweater or jacket\u2014a subtle reminder of the city\u2019s coolness\u2014will be a welcome companion, especially as you stroll through the Marina or along the Embarcadero. Take advantage of this serene weather to enjoy a leisurely walk by the bay, grab a coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9 while the streets burst to life with the sound of laughter and conversation. With the marine layer gradually retreating, today beckons you to explore and cherish the little moments that make San Francisco so beautifully unique.",
