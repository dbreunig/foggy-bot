    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, a mood of gentle anticipation envelops the city. The air is cool and carries a hint of moisture, setting the stage for the faint possibility of rain later tonight. Currently, a blanket of clouds drapes over the skyline, casting a gray hush that softens the edges of buildings and blurs the distant view of the Golden Gate Bridge. With temperatures dipping to around fifty degrees, the evening suggests a chill that beckons warmer layers. A light west wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it the scent of the bay, as the chance of precipitation lingers in the atmosphere.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the forecast promises a shift towards brighter skies, with the sun expected to break through the clouds, bathing the city in a muted glow. Temperatures will hover near fifty-nine, offering a refreshing respite from the coolness of the night. For those venturing outdoors, a light jacket or sweater would be ideal as the morning chill gives way to a milder midday warmth. Consider a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the water reflects the changing light, or perhaps a quiet afternoon spent in one of the city's nearby parks\u2014perfect for a serene escape among the trees. As the fog gently dances on the horizon, it\u2019s a reminder of the unique charm that makes San Francisco endlessly captivating.",
