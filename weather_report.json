    "weather_report": "As the night cloaks Downtown San Francisco, a serene clarity permeates the air, inviting quiet contemplation. The forecast whispers of a soothing transition from moonlit calm to a day filled with mild warmth and gentle breezes. Expect the sun to rise and grace the city with its gentle embrace, a teasing promise of sunshine unveiling the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge against a backdrop of prone hills. With a high creeping toward sixty-two degrees, the afternoon might draw some warmth closer to the coast, while a light breeze from the west caresses the skin, lending a hint of freshness to the atmosphere.\n\nYet, the reassuring absence of fog lingers in the night, suggesting the marine layer remains held at bay. The air is crisp, ideal for a comfortable stroll through the city. As the residents emerge from their night\u2019s rest, thick layers may give way to light sweaters or jackets better suited for a spirited exploration of a cozy caf\u00e9 or a leisurely walk down the Embarcadero. Perhaps one might wander to a hidden bookstore, letting the quiet of the morning hour fill their mind with stories waiting to be uncovered, as the city awakens gradually, each moment steeped in the soft light of a simple Friday.",
