    "weather_report": "As twilight approaches Downtown San Francisco, the scene is a blend of clarity and the promise of calm. The sky is adorned with the gentle brushstrokes of high-altitude clouds, illuminated by a soft, diffused light. Although there is no oppressive fog at present, remnants of the marine layer still linger near the fringes, hinting at a classic San Francisco evening. The cool air carries with it a refreshing touch, a reminder of the Pacific's embrace, with the temperature comfortably settling around fifty degrees.\n\nThis evening\u2019s forecast leads gently into a pleasantly mild day tomorrow, where promises of warmth beckon for excursions beyond the confines of home. As for attire, layering is the wise choice\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater paired with a light jacket, perfect for wrapping against the evening chill as you wander the streets. An evening stroll along the Embarcadero may yield the invigorating experience of wind at your back while gazing upon the shimmering waters that cradle the city. Alternatively, a quiet seat at a local caf\u00e9 could allow for reflective moments, while sipping on a hot beverage as the sun sinks below the horizon, giving way to a tapestry of stars overhead.",
