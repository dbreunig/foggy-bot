    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sun offers a gentle but invigorating warmth, although a cool sea breeze always lingers, reminding us of the bay\u2019s embrace. The current temperature hovers near 64 degrees, tempting many to shed their layers, though it may quickly retreat to 62. The urban landscape glistens in clear light, a vibrant contrast to the slightly overcast sky hinting at the possibility of evening drizzle. As dusk approaches, be mindful of the wisps of cloud gathering\u2014around 2 AM, they may stir into a patchy drizzle, their shadows casting a soft gray over the city.\n\nFor those wandering the streets as night falls, a light jacket or sweater is advisable, as temperatures descend toward a gentle 56, accompanied by winds shifting from the southwest. Under the dimming daylight, the wind may still dance through, offering a refreshing bite. Perhaps indulge in a stroll along the waterfront or gather with friends at a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor an afternoon coffee, watching the tide-like influx of evening activity. Seek out those hidden gems of the city that exude character and warmth, and allow the gentle rhythm of the night to seep into your soul.",
