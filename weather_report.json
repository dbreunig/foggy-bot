    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night unfolds under a blanket of mottled clouds, a canvas that whispers of the cool ocean air rolling in from the west. With a gentle breeze rustling through, it carries the brisk chill of the sea, wrapping around the city and keeping temperatures comfortably in the mid-fifties. As dawn approaches, the promise of a partly sunny Sunday emerges, hinting at a warmer high near sixty-two. The winds will dance playfully, a blend of strength and grace, gusting to twenty-six miles per hour, hinting at a lively day ahead.\n\nAs the fog clings lightly to the fringes, there is a certain serenity about the streets, a quiet anticipation that encourages a walk amongst the trails or perhaps a prime opportunity for a leisurely brunch in a hidden caf\u00e9. Dressing in layers will be wise\u2014a lightweight sweater accompanied by a light jacket will prepare you for the shifting moods of the day. Whether you choose to explore the urban landscape on foot or simply revel in the comforting ambiance of an outdoor patio, today beckons a balance of activity and ease, unfurling like the clouds above.",
