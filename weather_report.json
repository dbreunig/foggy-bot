    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a dense curtain of clouds blankets the skyline, holding the promise of rain close to its heart. The air feels heavy with anticipation, and the fresh scent of moisture fills the streets. Rain showers will soon turn into a symphony of thunder as the skies darken further, with chilly winds swirling in from the southwest, creating a brisk and bustling atmosphere. The temperature, having peaked at 57, will now slowly descend, with only a slight rise overnight, hinting at a night best spent indoors.\n\nVisibility may be limited as fog and a marine layer roll in, obscuring views of the iconic Golden Gate, creating an ethereal scene that muffles the city's usual energy. For those braving the weather, layered clothing will serve well\u2014think a cozy sweater beneath a waterproof jacket paired with sturdy shoes. The humidity calls for evening activities that allow you to be sheltered yet still enjoy the evening's ambiance: perhaps a warm cup of coffee in a quiet caf\u00e9, the charm of an art gallery, or a leisurely stroll through covered walkways, where the city's character remains alluring, even under the clouds.",
