Tonight's low settles around a comfortable 50 degrees, accompanied by a westward breeze that whispers through the streets. Though the world has dimmed, the promise of a vibrant Sunday looms on the horizon, where midday temperatures will flirt with the 60s under a mostly sunny sky. Expect the wind to pick up, a lively dance of 8 to 16 mph, punctuated by gusts that might surprise you with a playful insistence.\n\nAs morning unfolds, sunlight will chase away the lingering shadows, revealing the city\u2019s grand structures and iconic vistas with refreshing clarity. The day looks inviting, albeit still cool, suggesting a light jacket or a cozy sweater for those venturing beyond the cozy confines of home. It\u2019s an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero to absorb the bustling energy of the waking city, or perhaps to cradle a warm cup of coffee in one of the neighborhood caf\u00e9s, savoring the juxtaposition of a serene morning and the urban rhythm. Enjoy the simple beauty of a city awakening as peace mingles with the promise of a lively day ahead, free from the fog\u2019s overwhelming cloak.",
