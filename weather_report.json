    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a canopy of sunlit blue, as the expected high lazily drifts toward a pleasant 60 degrees. The gentle caress of a west-southwest breeze whispers through the streets, painting the day with clarity and warmth. Gone are any remnants of fog, with the air unburdened, allowing for splendid views that stretch towards the Golden Gate. As the light shifts into the evening, the temperatures will cool gracefully, settling around 46 degrees, with a mostly clear night inviting stargazers to breathe in the crispness.\n\nFor a day like this, one might consider donning layers that keep comfort at the helm\u2014perhaps a light sweater paired with a breeze-friendly jacket. As the sun begins its descent, the chill may invite a warm drink in hand, making it an ideal time for a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the waterfront views and soft sounds of the city envelop the senses, or settling into a cozy caf\u00e9 to watch the world pass by. Embrace the simple joys of this radiant afternoon, for its charm lies in the richness of light and space that envelops San Francisco.",
