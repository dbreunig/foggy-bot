    "weather_report": "As the gentle embrace of night wanes in Downtown San Francisco, a delicate veil of clouds hangs overhead, hinting at the possibility of a brief drizzle. At this hour, the ambient coolness invites a light jacket but offers respite from the city's usual hustle. The west-southwest wind whispers through the streets, making the air feel fresh, yet not biting\u2014perfect for a contemplative stroll or perhaps a quiet caf\u00e9 visit.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the slight chance of morning drizzle may come and go before the sun rises higher, casting a warming glow across the cityscape. Expect a transition from the muted grays of early light to the brighter palette of a mostly sunny day, where the temperature promises a comfortable 65 to 67 degrees. The wind, playful yet steady, will offer gentle gusts\u2014ideal for those out and about, perhaps on their bicycles or enjoying a leisurely walk along the waterfront. \n\nThe marine layer may cling to the higher vistas, creating a dramatic backdrop against the sun-kissed bay, but it will clear as the day unfolds, letting you bask in that quintessential San Francisco charm.  So if you find yourself wandering through the streets of the city, a light sweater or a comfortable long-sleeve shirt should suffice. Consider indulging in a midday lunch at an outdoor caf\u00e9, where the city can be savored at a slower pace, or venture out to a local bookstore to browse for a new read while the day unfolds pleasantly.",
