    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle shroud of clouds hangs above, whispering secrets of a slight drizzle that lingers in the early hours. The temperature drifts softly towards a cool 56, inviting the crispness of the west southwest winds, which rustle through the streets at 7 to 14 mph. There's an unassuming chance of some light precipitation in the early morning hours\u2014a modest 20%, yet enough to warrant a cautious step outside.\n\nAs the dawn approaches, a similar narrative unfolds for Tuesday. The clouds will persist, obscuring the sun's warmth until late morning, with highs hovering around 63 and dropping subtly as afternoon sets in. The cool winds will carry with them that familiar maritime scent, a hallmark of the city\u2019s coastal charm. Dressing in layers is advisable; a light jacket or sweater will provide comfort against the brisk currents. \n\nFor those waking to this muted morning, it is the perfect opportunity to sip warm coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9, perhaps overlooking the still waters of the Bay, or to take a leisurely stroll through nearby parks, where nature's subtle hues will bring calm even amid the clouded skies. There\u2019s an intimate beauty to these moments, inviting contemplation and quietude, as the city breathes softly in the embrace of summer\u2019s lingering coolness.",
