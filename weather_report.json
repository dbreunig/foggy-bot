    "weather_report": "In downtown San Francisco, the sky is cloaked in a mottled gray, hinting at the possibility of rain later in the afternoon. The air carries a crisp edge, a foretaste of the cool breeze that dances through the streets at around 14 miles per hour. As your gaze drifts across the cityscape, the iconic silhouettes appear somewhat muted, shadowed by clouds that swarm from the south and southwest. The forecast whispers of the temperature gently falling to around 60 degrees, suggesting a soft retreat from the day's warmth that never truly materialized.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect the clouds to settle deeper into a night filled with moisture and the faint possibility of drizzle, as well as a low settling near 54 degrees. It\u2019s a good idea to prepare for a cozy evening indoors, perhaps curled up with a book at one of the neighborhood caf\u00e9s, where the warm lights create an inviting atmosphere amid the gloom. Layering up is wise; a light jacket will provide comfort against the oncoming chill while leaving room for a more relaxed ensemble beneath. If you venture out, perhaps walk along the waterfront, allowing the cool air to refresh your thoughts as the sun bids farewell beyond a shroud of gray. Each moment spent in this characteristically San Francisco weather feels both invigorating and contemplative.",
