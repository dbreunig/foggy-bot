The forecast holds promise for tonight; a gentle descent into a cool low around fifty degrees, with a mellow southwest wind weaving through the city at six miles per hour. Though the low light may veil some of the more distant features\u2014the silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and the rolling hills of Marin\u2014there\u2019s a pleasant coolness that invites evening strolls and quiet gatherings.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will emerge with a sunny disposition, illuminating the streets with warmth, peaking near sixty-four degrees before the afternoon\u2019s gentle decline to around sixty-one. The breeze may shift slightly but remains light and agreeable, perfect for a leisurely day. As the morning unfolds, one might consider a light jacket or a cozy sweater to combat the lingering chill of the fog that often clings to the bay. With such ideal conditions, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of something delightful, followed by a pleasant walk along the waterfront to soak in the sights, would be the perfect way to revel in this unmistakably San Francisco day.",
