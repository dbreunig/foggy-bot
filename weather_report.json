    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp under an inviting sun, with warmth hovering around 64 degrees. A gentle west-southwest breeze dances through the city, caressing the skin at a brisk 14 mph, while occasional gusts remind you of the ocean's presence. Shadows stretch gracefully as the day begins to transition, lending the scene a calming beauty. \n\nAs daylight gives way to twilight, expect the skies to draw a blanket of clouds, hinting at a slight chance of drizzle later in the night. With temperatures cooling to a cozy 54 degrees, dressing in layers will be prudent; perhaps a light jacket to fend off the evening chill, yet casual enough for a stroll through the streets. The marine layer may linger near the water\u2019s edge but seems less ominous today than in times past, making outdoor pursuits appealing. Whether you wander into a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink or explore the charm of a nearby park, the evening promises comfort wrapped in the elegance of an unwinding city, glowing softly in the fading light.",
