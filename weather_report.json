As temperatures settle around a mild 48 degrees, the gentle north-northeast breeze whispers through the streets, inviting a sense of calm. The forecast hints at a welcoming warmth come morning, with a sunny high of 68 expected, although you may notice the day yielding to cooler temperatures by afternoon\u2014an effortless dance of seasons that characterizes this vibrant coastal city.\n\nThe clarity of the night reveals a landscape unencumbered by the usual marine fog that can roll in and shroud the skyline. However, a light sweater or jacket might still offer comfort against the coolness of the evening as the sun prepares to rise on a day full of promise. Tomorrow beckons with the kind of weather that encourages simple pleasures\u2014an invigorating stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment spent sipping coffee at a local caf\u00e9, where conversation flows as easily as the breeze. As you venture out, consider wearing layers that accommodate both the chill of the morning and the warmth of midday; perhaps jeans paired with a light shirt and a cardigan will serve you well. In such splendid weather, allow yourself the leisure of taking in the beauty of this city, whether through art galleries or casual ramblings among the iconic hills.",
