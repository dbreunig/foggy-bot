    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco is basking in the embrace of a sunny afternoon, the clear skies extending a warm invitation to those who venture outside. A gentle breeze from the west dances through the streets, carrying with it the clean freshness of the bay. The temperature hovers near a comfortable 68 degrees, gradually yielding to a slightly cooler 66 as the sun begins its descent. The absence of fog allows for breathtaking views, revealing the city's iconic skyline and the graceful arches of the Golden Gate Bridge against a backdrop of painted blue, unmarred by the usual marine layer.\n\nAs night approaches, skies will remain mostly clear, with evening temperatures dipping to around 51 degrees, suggesting a light cardigan or a soft sweater would be wise. With the wind whispering at a mellow pace, it\u2019s the perfect moment to enjoy a leisurely stroll through a local park or perhaps to sit at a caf\u00e9, savoring a warm beverage while people-watching. The evening promises a tranquil yet invigorating ambiance, offering a gentle close to a day illuminated by sun and laughter.",
