    "weather_report": "Tonight, downtown San Francisco settles into a calm embrace, with the air fresh and the clouds drifting softly overhead. The temperature dips to a mild 43 degrees, creating a crisp backdrop against which the city lights twinkle like distant stars. A gentle northeast wind stirs, whispering tales of the sea as it tugs playfully at your collar. The night feels inviting, though a light jacket would do well to shield against the coolness that lingers.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the city will bask in sunshine, transforming the skyline with golden hues. The warmth will rise to a comfortable 53, yet by afternoon it will retreat slightly, settling into the low 50s as the sun makes its arc across the sky. The clarity of the day promises striking views, unmarred by fog or haze, allowing one to fully appreciate the iconic contours of the Golden Gate. This could be a delightful day for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to the local caf\u00e9s, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the delightful chatter of fellow wanderers. Dress lightly, perhaps in layers, to adapt to the shifting temperatures, and savor the distinctive charm of a day in this vibrant city.",
