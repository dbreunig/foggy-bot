The west-southwest winds carry whispers of the sea, rustling the foliage as they dance around you. However, as evening approaches, a marine layer will weave its way through the city, bringing with it the familiar embrace of patchy fog. The forecast hints at the possibility of light rain showers just after midnight, with clouds gathering like cautious spectators awaiting the performance of nature.\n\nWhile the day has begun with a hint of vibrancy, the clouds are slowly darkening, urging you to dress in layers\u2014a light sweater will serve you well, ready to fend off the coolness that the night will inevitably usher in. A stroll along the Embarcadero might provide a moment of tranquility, letting the sound of the lapping waves accompany your thoughts. Perhaps plan for a quiet evening indoors, relishing a book or engaging in light conversation over a steaming cup of tea as the gentle fog begins to shroud the skyline, creating an atmosphere best suited for contemplative moments.",
