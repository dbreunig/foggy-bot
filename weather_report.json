    "weather_report": "The sun bathes Downtown San Francisco in a bright embrace this morning, casting shadows that dance lightly across the streets, an invitation for exploration. With temperatures nearing a gentle 65 degrees, the day is holding off the chill of the usual fog, allowing a rare clarity to blanket the city. As the hours unfold, the warmth might soften to roughly 63, with a light breeze from the west southwest murmuring secrets through the avenues\u2014perfect for those who enjoy a walk among the historic vistas or perhaps a leisurely lunch at a quaint caf\u00e9.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the skies will don a partly cloudy veil, whispering of the cooler night ahead with lows around 56. The subtle winds continue, lending a fresh feeling to the evening air, ideal for an evening stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment spent on a park bench. It\u2019s a day where casual layers reign supreme: think light sweaters or cardigans, perhaps a comfortably worn pair of shoes for gently meandering the urban landscape. A jaunt through the parks, a visit to a neighborhood bookstore, or simply sipping coffee while watching the world rhythmically drift by could be just the remedy this fine day calls for.",
