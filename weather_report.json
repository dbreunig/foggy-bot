    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the skies have taken on a muted tapestry of clouds, hinting at a day of transitional weather. The air is crisp, and while the sun attempts to push through the shifting layers of gray, a soft breeze from the west carries with it whispers of the sea. This afternoon\u2019s high hovers around a refreshing 62 degrees, but a dip to about 60 suggests that as the day unfolds, one should prepare for cooler moments, particularly as evening approaches. The wind, gentle but persistent, offers just enough movement to remind everyone that spring is in the air, even as the clouds can sometimes obscure the golden glow of the sun.\n\nAs night falls, a low of around 51 will settle in, cloaking the city in a cooler embrace, making a light jacket a wise choice if venturing out for a stroll or perhaps an evening visit to one of the many local cafes. While the fog may not dominate the scene today, hints of the marine layer linger at the periphery, waiting for the evening chill to bring a softness to the urban landscape. For those seeking a comforting activity, consider a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering waters reflect the city lights\u2014a perfect way to enjoy the unfolding beauty of the transition from day to night.",
