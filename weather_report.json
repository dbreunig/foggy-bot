    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sun shines brightly, draping the city in a warm glow that dances on the buildings and glistens on the bay. With temperatures hovering near a delightful 67 degrees, the air carries just a gentle hint of that familiar ocean breeze, stirring softly at 7 to 14 mph. The clarity of the day extends a visual invitation, unobstructed by the typical fog that envelops the city, allowing for views that stretch playfully across the horizon. \n\nAs twilight approaches, the evening will settle into partly cloudy skies, cradling the temperature around a comfortable 56 degrees. A calm west-southwest wind will continue to brush through the streets, lending an even more pleasant atmosphere to a city known for its ever-changing climate. Given the inviting nature of today, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9 might be just the right way to embrace the day. Light layers will serve well, making it easy to adjust as the sun descends into a cooler evening glow, ensuring you remain comfortable as the vibrant city takes on a new, softer character.",
