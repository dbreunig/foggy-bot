    "weather_report": "Today, Downtown San Francisco basks under a bright sun, casting a clear light over the city's iconic skyline. The air is crisp, with a gentle west-northwest breeze stirring through the streets. This morning, the temperatures hovered around the low fifties, signaling the promise of a pleasant day ahead, though a slight dip in warmth is expected as afternoon falls. The absence of fog leaves the Golden Gate Bridge in full view, each tower standing proudly against the blue expanse above.\n\nAs dusk approaches, a cool edge will settle in, offering a refreshing contrast to the daytime warmth, with temperatures expected to drop to the mid-forties. Dressing in layers will be wise; a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the evening chill, especially for those who plan to enjoy a leisurely walk along the waterfront or settle into one of the city\u2019s cozy cafes. Given these inviting conditions, a stroll through the Mission District could be delightful, allowing one to appreciate the vibrant murals and the burgeoning spring energy of the local community. The crispness of the air paired with the vibrant hues of blooming flowers makes for a splendid backdrop to a day filled with simple adventures.",
