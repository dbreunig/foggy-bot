    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, this afternoon unfolds under a mostly sunny sky, casting a warm and inviting light over the city, with temperatures rising to a pleasant 63 degrees. A gentle west wind whispers at around 15 mph, bringing with it the subtle cooling sensation characteristic of the Bay Area, with gusts hinting at a brisker feel occasionally. The clarity of the day offers sweeping views, although the presence of a light marine layer along the horizon suggests that the coastal fog may linger just out of reach, leaving the iconic Golden Gate Bridge stark against the shimmering expanse of blue.\n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will transition into a mostly clear night, the temperature dipping to a mild 50 degrees. It's a serene moment to enjoy the night's cool embrace, with a light southwest wind rustling through the streets and stirring the leaves in the parks. Dressing in layers is suggested; a light jacket should suffice to comfortably navigate the evening air. For those looking to make the most of this delightful day, an evening stroll along the waterfront or a quiet sit in one of the city\u2019s parks could serve as the perfect end to a beautiful day, allowing residents and visitors alike to revel in San Francisco's unique charm.",
