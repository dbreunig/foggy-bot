The air carries a crispness, bordered by a gentle west wind that brushes through the city at a brisk 25 mph. The skyline glimmers with promise, though the temperature retreats gently toward a comfortable 62, inviting residents to enjoy the late-day freshness. As night approaches, the charm will take on a more muted tone, with clouds softly encroaching and patchy drizzle expected to drift in after one, urging a change in plans for the evening.\n\nThe cityscape might appear slightly veiled, hinting at the remnants of the marine layer, a whisper of fog that settles along the edges of the bay, foreshadowing the night\u2019s moisture. If you venture out, consider layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater paired with a breathable long-sleeve shirt to navigate the shifting temperatures. This evening could be ideal for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering bay reflects the twilight hues, or a quiet cafe visit where conversations warm the air. The scene is set for an evening of calm yet engaging moments, making it a perfect time to embrace the city's understated allure.",
