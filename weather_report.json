    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun casts its gentle warmth over Downtown San Francisco, the city enjoys a rare moment of vibrant clarity. With a high near 62 degrees, the sky is an inviting blue, dotted with the occasional soft, white cloud. A gentle west wind carries the promise of spring, but as the day progresses into evening, the fog will weave its way back in, cloaking the city in its signature mystique. Tonight, residents can expect patchy fog to creep in around 4 a.m., an echo of the marine layer that often dances around the Golden Gate area.\n\nFor those venturing out today, a light jacket or sweater will suffice as the temperatures dip to around 50 by nightfall. The clear skies provide a perfect backdrop for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or a quiet afternoon at a local caf\u00e9, where one might sip a warm cup of coffee while watching the world go by. As day turns to night, the soft embrace of fog will arrive, creating an ethereal atmosphere perfect for unwinding. Embrace the serenity of San Francisco as it transitions, letting the city\u2019s charm envelop you like the coming dusk.",
