    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco with a serene brightness. The sun shines upon the cityscape, painting the familiar horizon with clarity, where gentle breezes carry the freshness of spring. As the day progresses, temperatures glide from a pleasant height, lingering near the mid-60s, to a comfortable late afternoon coolness, hovering a bit lower. The vibrant light casts warm hues on the historic buildings, while the west winds, rustling through the streets at 8 to 17 mph, provide an invigorating touch.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will don a softer motif, with partly cloudy aspects revealing a low in the early 50s, inviting the city to settle into its twilight charm. Tonight\u2019s gustier winds at 12 to 18 mph offer that familiar coastal crispness. A light jacket will serve well against the brisk air if you wander to a nearby caf\u00e9 or embrace a stroll along the waterfront. With such delightful weather, a visit to Golden Gate Park for a leisurely walk or simply enjoying a book in one of its sun-kissed meadows can perfectly encapsulate this picturesque day.",
