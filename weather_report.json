    "weather_report": "As evening descends on Downtown San Francisco, the air is delightfully crisp, kissed by a gentle wind that carries whispers from the Golden Gate. The current low rests around a calming fifty-three degrees, with a west southwest breeze swaying gently at ten to sixteen miles per hour. The sky, largely clear, showcases a tranquil palette\u2014a perfect backdrop for the twinkling lights that will soon adorn the cityscape. Tonight feels especially inviting, the pleasant conditions beckoning for those inclined to wander beneath the stars or embrace the cool air from the bay.\n\nLooking ahead to Juneteenth, the promise of sunlit warmth fills the atmosphere, with temperatures nearing sixty-two degrees, a cooling descent anticipated as the day unfolds. The west winds will pick up, offering a refreshing embrace, gusting to thirty-one miles per hour. Such breezy vigor complements the sunny demeanor of the day, although one might notice the lingering presence of fog, especially as the day drifts toward its softer hours. Dressing in layers will serve well\u2014perhaps a lightweight sweater for the chill, coupled with a comfortable pair of shoes for an evening stroll. In these serene surroundings, the draw to delight in a small caf\u00e9, take in the splendid views of the waterfront, or simply unwind at a nearby park feels particularly appealing, as the city glimmers like a jewel adorned against the relentless surf of the Pacific.",
