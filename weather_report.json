    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a blanket of bright sunshine, with temperatures gently swaying around a pleasant 69 degrees. The air feels invigorating, caressed by a west-southwest breeze that dances between 7 to 14 mph, occasionally gusting up to 21 mph, lending a spirited touch that stirs the leaves of nearby trees and rustles the corners of jackets worn by strolling urbanites. There\u2019s a clarity to the day that suggests a crispness in the atmosphere, making it more than suitable for leisurely pursuits.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will transition into a soft tapestry of partial clouds, with nighttime temperatures settling comfortably at around 59 degrees. This change invites a subtle shift in attire\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket for those venturing out after dark, as the evening air may become a tad cool. Given these splendid conditions, one might choose to join friends at a charming outdoor caf\u00e9, basking in the sun over a warm drink. Alternatively, a walk along the waterfront could provide a tranquil escape, allowing the rhythm of the bay to soothe the soul as twilight begins to softly embrace the city.",
