    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city appears bathed in a gentle golden light, underscoring the promise of a beautiful day ahead. With the sun peeking over the hills, its rays warm the cool morning air, offering a delightful invitation to step outside. Today, residents can expect a mostly sunny day, with temperatures rising to a comfortable high that will make the city feel lively yet relaxed. The breeze from the west, gentle yet invigorating, reminds us that the coast, with its breathtaking views and distant waves, is never far away.\n\nHowever, the lingering presence of marine layers still clings to the edges of the city, creating an ethereal softness to the skyline. The fog dances at the periphery, lending a sense of mystery to the iconic Golden Gate Bridge as it emerges through the veil. Suggested attire for the day would lean towards light layers\u2014perhaps a relaxed cotton shirt paired with a light jacket for those moments when the breeze brings a slight chill. As the day unfolds, it beckons one to embark on simple pleasures: a stroll through the bustling streets, a quiet moment in a sunlit caf\u00e9, or perhaps a leisurely walk along the waterfront, where the beauty of the bay meets the vibrancy of urban life.",
