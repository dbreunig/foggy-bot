The cool air wraps around like an old scarf, promising a low of around 50 degrees\u2014a reminder that even in the embrace of spring, the Bay can still hold a chill. Winds from the west whisper at about 8 mph, serving as a gentle guide for those contemplating an evening stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a leisurely visit to one of the charming local cafes.\n\nTomorrow unfolds with the promise of sunshine, a mostly splendid day ahead with temperatures nudging toward a comfortable 61 degrees. The skies are expected to brighten, inviting residents to step outside and savor the fresh air. While the fog may linger in the distance, perhaps draping itself over the hills, clarity should characterize the day for most. It\u2019s a perfect moment to dress in layers\u2014a lightweight sweater paired with a light jacket will provide just the right balance against the lingering coolness. With the sun shining down and the marine layer retreating, it would be an ideal occasion for a casual exploration of the Presidio's pathways or a quiet afternoon at a local park, perhaps with a book and a warm beverage at hand.",
