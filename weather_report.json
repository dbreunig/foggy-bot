    "weather_report": "As the night envelops Downtown San Francisco, there's a subtle charm in the air, tinged with a sprinkle of mist\u2014a promise that lives between the shadows and whispers. The forecast hints at only a faint possibility of drizzle, but the serene ambiance holds a gentle allure. The west-southwest winds murmur softly, their strength perhaps teasing those with an ear for the city's nocturnal symphony. Tonight, the skies remain mostly clear, with temperatures seeking comfort around 56 degrees. A casual stroll along the waterfront or a quiet evening in a nearby caf\u00e9 could reveal the city\u2019s embrace, steeped in the peacefulness that dusk brings.\n\nAs we look towards Monday, the sun will paint the city anew, washing away the night\u2019s quiet shroud. A glimmer of warmth is promised, with temperatures creeping up to a pleasant 67, then gracefully settling back to around 65 as the day gently passes. While the morning may hold a slight chance of drizzle, the sun's rays will soon conquer, illuminating the charm of the streets. For this day, a light jacket or sweater against the morning\u2019s cool breath would be wise, before shedding it to bask in the warmth of the afternoon glow. Consider a leisurely walk through Golden Gate Park or a moment spent with a book in hand, enjoying the revitalizing energy of a sun-drenched afternoon.",
