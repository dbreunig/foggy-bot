    "weather_report": "A gentle evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, bringing with it a clarity that embraces the city in a tender embrace. Tonight, the skies remain mostly clear, inviting a breath of cool air that brushes against the skin, with temperatures softly settling around 58 degrees. A light southwest wind murmurs through the streets, its playful gusts swirling around the corners, making the evening feel refreshingly alive.\n\nAs we look ahead to Thursday, the city awakens beneath a sunny disposition. Bright rays herald a high near 74, gradually giving way to a more tempered warmth of 72 as the afternoon unfolds. The whisper of the wind continues, lending a soft comfort that hints at the essence of the bay. The current conditions paint a pleasing picture, with the signature marine layer keeping the fog at bay for now, allowing views across the horizon to stretch unobstructed. With such promising weather, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront beckons, perhaps indulging in a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, where one can sip coffee and watch the world dance before them, framed by the majestic views that define San Francisco.",
