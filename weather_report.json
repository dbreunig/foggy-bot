    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a brilliant sun, casting its warm embrace over the iconic skyline. Temperatures hover pleasantly in the low 60s, with a gentle, invigorating breeze from the west southwest, sending ripples through the air as it dances playfully around corners and along open spaces. The sky is a canvas of azure, free from the usual veil of fog that often shrouds the Bay Area, offering a clear view of familiar landmarks glistening in the sunlight.\n\nAs the evening approaches, the clouds will begin to weave themselves into the fabric of the sky, lending an air of whimsy. The temperature will dip slightly, settling into the cool embrace of the night at around 51 degrees. It\u2019s a time beckoning for layers \u2013 a light jacket or a cozy sweater for those venturing outdoors, making for a comfortable interplay of warmth and coolness. With the sun dipping toward the horizon, consider unwinding at an outdoor caf\u00e9, savoring the flavors of local cuisine, or taking a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the tranquil sounds of water lapping against the docks create a soothing backdrop to the day\u2019s close.",
