    "weather_report": "As dawn casts its gentle light upon Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a crispness heralding a refreshing early morning. With a low around 50 degrees, it\u2019s a perfect moment to pull on a light sweater or jacket before stepping outside. The forecast promises a progression from this cool embrace to a comfortably warm afternoon, where the sun will tease the high near 64 degrees, but the temperature will gradually retreat to a pleasant 62 as the day unfolds. \n\nThe skies will largely be painted in strokes of blue, punctuated by occasional patches of soft clouds. The iconic marine layer, a hallmark of San Francisco\u2019s climate, seems to linger further out, creating a veil over the ocean while allowing a clearer view of the skyline. As you navigate the day, consider meandering through the city\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods or indulging in a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. The cool breeze invites moments spent with a warm cup of coffee on a sunlit terrace, where light conversations can intermingle with the gentle sounds of the bay. Today presents a canvas of mild weather beckoning the city\u2019s residents to savor the subtly shifting beauty of this iconic landscape.",
