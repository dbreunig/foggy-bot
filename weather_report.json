    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the day relinquishes its warmth, gracing the city with a gentle clarity. The air, mild and inviting, carries the distinct aroma of the bay, as remnants of sunlight flicker upon the water, revealing paths of shimmering gold. With a low of around 56 degrees anticipated, all signs point to a serene evening, the slightly crisp breeze swirling softly from the north at just a whisper.\n\nTuesday unfurls with promises of brightness, as the sun ascends to heighten the day to nearly 77 degrees before retreating slightly to a comfortable 74. This largely sunny day hints at a rare moment of joy, with nary a trace of fog to obscure the iconic skyline. As the clouds drift further afield, revelers can don their light jackets and stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps pausing for a moment of contemplation by the Ferry Building, where the ebb and flow of daily life intertwine peacefully with the rhythm of the tide. Whether it be a casual coffee shop visit or an afternoon spent exploring the vibrant Mission District \u2013 the city breathes an abundant air of inspiration and possibility.",
