    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens, a gentle veil of patchy drizzle embraces Downtown San Francisco, weaving itself into the fabric of a mostly cloudy night. The air carries a familiar hint of salt, mingling with the cool breeze whispering through the streets. With temperatures resting at a comfortable 59 degrees, it's advisable to don a light jacket, especially for those venturing out into the night, whether walking along the waterfront or savoring a quiet dinner at one of the local bistros. The chance of precipitation hovers at a modest 20 percent, suggesting that while dampness may linger, it is unlikely to be overwhelming.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Wednesday, expect the clouds to part, revealing a canvas of blue punctuated by sunlight. The day promises a warm embrace, with temperatures climbing to a pleasant 68 degrees and eventually settling around 66 in the afternoon. There may still be pockets of mist hanging in the air, remnants of the overcast night, but the sun's rays will uplift the city, creating an inviting atmosphere for a stroll through the parks or perhaps a leisurely brunch at an outdoor caf\u00e9. With steady winds from the west southwest, ranging from a gentle 7 to 17 mph, the conditions will be invigorating, perfect for one to run errands or simply enjoy the leisurely pace of city life. \n\nFor those planning their day, light layers will serve well; a comfortable sweater or light scarf will shield against any lingering coolness as evening falls again. Consider a visit to the galleries or a bite at a local eatery, basking in the serene energy of a city waking up to sunlight after a night\u2019s drizzle.",
