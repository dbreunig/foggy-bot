Although temperatures are starting to dip around the 63-degree mark, a refreshing west-southwest wind dances through the streets at a brisk 21 mph, adding a slight chill to the evening air. There\u2019s an ever-so-slight chance of drizzle later tonight, yet the bulk of the atmosphere is defined by a subtle clarity, unmarred by the dense fog that often blankets the city.\n\nAs evening approaches, the remnants of brightness linger, encouraging a stroll down the Embarcadero or perhaps a leisurely dinner at a cozy nearby caf\u00e9. Dressing in layers would be wise\u2014 a light jacket or cardigan to wrap around your shoulders once the sun slips behind the horizon, complemented by comfortable shoes for an impromptu walk along the bay. Enjoy this lovely, temperate afternoon while the light holds, and let the promise of a tranquil evening wash over the city.",
