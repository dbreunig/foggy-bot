    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon envelops the city in a gentle embrace of sunshine, though the warmth is tempered by a cool breeze from the west. As the hours unfold, the temperature hovers near 65 degrees, gradually dipping towards a soft 62 in the later parts of the afternoon, inviting a sense of nostalgia for those fleeting summer days. The wind whispers through the streets at around 15 mph, offering a refreshing caress that whisks away the remnants of yesterday\u2019s chill. \n\nTonight, a blanket of clouds will usher in cooler comforts, with lows settling around 55 degrees. The winds will soften, still playful, but easing to a more serene pace. While the horizon remains clear for now, the telltale signs of impending fog may begin to crowd the edges as dusk approaches, hinting at the presence of the ever-cautious marine layer returning to its coastal hideaways. In this mosaic of weather, dressing in layers becomes your ally\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a simple tee, ready to don a jacket as nightfall envelops the city. As you venture out, consider a stroll along the waterfront or a relaxing seat at a local caf\u00e9, sipping on a warm drink while the world around you seems to slow, all beneath the colorful embrace of San Francisco\u2019s evening glow.",
