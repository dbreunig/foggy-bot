    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, a cloak of cloudiness envelops the city, hinting at the cooler embrace of summer\u2019s arrival. With temperatures dipping into the low fifties, there\u2019s a briskness in the air, invigorated by a west-southwest wind that whispers through the streets at a steady pace. The gusts, playful yet firm, remind us of the coastal energy just beyond the urban sprawl. Stars remain shy behind the clouds, and a mild marine layer wraps around the Golden Gate, providing a soft filter over the iconic landmark while the city glows beneath it.\n\nAs dawn breaks into Sunday, the clouds will gradually yield to the sun, bringing a gentle warmth as the day unfolds. The high will flirt with the sixties, though expect a gradual shift into the cooler afternoon as the sun plays hide and seek. A light breeze will accompany the sunshine, an invitation to step outdoors. As you consider attire for the day, layers remain your best friend; a light jacket will seamlessly complement your morning coffee ritual and can be shed as the sun takes its place high in the sky. With such enticing weather, perhaps a stroll through Golden Gate Park or a visit to the local farmer\u2019s market is in order, allowing one to savor the flavors and sights that define this vibrant city.",
