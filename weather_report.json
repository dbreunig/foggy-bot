    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle disposition, bringing a hint of sunshine to an otherwise cool tableau. As daylight drifts toward its golden hour, the air is mostly clear with glimpses of blue peeking through the cloud cover. Despite a slight chance of rain that lingers ominously before 5 PM, the weather remains pleasantly mild, with temperatures hovering around a comfortable 60 degrees. The westward breeze, brushing softly against the skin, carries the scent of the ocean, hinting at the distinct possibility of the familiar marine layer that could creep in later tonight.\n\nAs evening approaches, patchy fog is expected to settle in after 4 AM, cloaking the city in a tender shroud of mystery. When stepping out, a light jacket would be prudent to ward off the chill that accompanies the nightfall. For those drawn to the allure of quiet streets, this is a time well-suited for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero, perhaps savoring a warm cup of coffee while absorbing the tranquil ambiance. This afternoon's charm contrasts splendidly with the evening's impending calm, inviting reflection and quiet pleasures on a day that gracefully blends sunlit laughter with softened whispers of fog.",
