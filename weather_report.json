    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun stretches across Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth envelops the city, reaching heights near a comfortable 70 degrees. With the breeze flowing in from the west-southwest at a brisk 18 mph, residents find the day both vibrant and invigorating. The sky, a clear blue tapestry, allows the landmarks of the city, including the Golden Gate Bridge, to stand out in sharp relief against the horizon, promising a delightful transition into the evening.\n\nAs night approaches, however, patches of drizzle are poised to make an appearance late in the evening, accompanied by a soft blanket of clouds that will descend, cooling the air to a balmy 59 degrees. While the chance of precipitation lingers at a modest 20%, it may still alter plans for outdoor activities. Dressing for the day would require layers, perhaps a light jacket for those evening strolls by the waterfront, where the air will take on a more refreshing quality. As the sun dips below the horizon, consider enjoying a peaceful walk along the Embarcadero or finding solace in one of the city's vibrant caf\u00e9s, where the warmth of conversation contrasts the cool evening air.",
