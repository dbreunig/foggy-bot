    "weather_report": "As the sun begins to cast its warm golden light across the San Francisco skyline, today promises a delightful experience for those who step outside. The morning unveils mostly sunny skies, a welcome respite from the cool marine layer that often blankets the city. While the air remains crisp, overall temperatures are expected to hover around a comfortable 65 degrees, dipping slightly as the afternoon draws near. A gentle southwest breeze briskly sways through the streets, offering both a refreshing touch and a hint of the ocean's breath.\n\nTonight, clouds will gradually gather, wrapping the city in a soft embrace as temperatures slide to a mild 54 degrees. With the winds persisting, the evening transitions to a quiet calm under the cover of cloud, perfect for stargazing or enjoying a cozy dinner al fresco. For those venturing out today, a light layer such as a cardigan or a light jacket will suffice against the shifting breezes. Consider exploring the local caf\u00e9s, indulging in a leisurely stroll through the park, or immersing oneself in the galleries\u2014each offering a slice of San Francisco\u2019s vibrant character amidst the early summer charm.",
