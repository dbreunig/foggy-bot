    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the city wears a cloak of partly cloudy skies. The air carries a crispness, with a low of around fifty, as a west wind unfurls its energy at twenty-one miles per hour, occasionally gusting higher. This bustling breeze whispers secrets of the coastline, teasing the senses with hints of the sea. For those embarking outside tonight, a light jacket will be your closest companion, just enough to greet the cool air without being weighed down.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the sun will make its grand ascent, promising a delightful and sunny day with temperatures rising toward sixty. The winds will continue their playful dance, maintaining a robust presence at sixteen to twenty-five miles per hour. It will be a day for strolling along the waterfront, perhaps lingering at a cozy caf\u00e9, indulging in the simple pleasure of a warm drink. With the fleeting fog forecasted to remain a distant memory as the sun climbs, you may find it an ideal time to venture into the myriad charms of the city, enjoying the clarity that only a fine day can provide, with plenty of layers to accommodate the shifting coastal conditions.",
