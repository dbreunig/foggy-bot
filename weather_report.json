    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the sun bathes the city under a brilliant blue sky, though it may be a deceptive warmth as temperatures peak around a cool 60 degrees before retreating to a more brisk 57 this afternoon. The gentle west-southwest breeze carries a fresh touch, promising a pleasant experience for those who choose to step outdoors, but the chill of brisk air reminds us not to leave our layers behind. \n\nAs the day meanders, you may find the atmosphere transforming into a softly lit evening, with partly cloudy skies ushering in a low around 50 degrees, ideal for a cozy sweater or light jacket. While the day appears mostly clear, it seems that the iconic fog is biding its time, perhaps lingering close to the coast and the bay, offering a hint of mystique without fully enveloping the city. This makes it a splendid day for a casual stroll through the vibrant streets of San Francisco or a leisurely moment spent sitting in a caf\u00e9, the aromas of roasted coffee mingling with the crisp air. Embrace the day\u2019s essence; perhaps take a quiet moment to watch the world pass by, wrapped in warmth and the gentle conversation of the city around you.",
