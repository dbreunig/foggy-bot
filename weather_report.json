    "weather_report": "As night falls over Downtown San Francisco, a thick curtain of rain cloaks the city, casting a somber yet poetic veil over its iconic skyline. The clouds hang heavily in the sky, resembling a gray tapestry woven with fleeting gusts of wind, marking a night defined by a relentless symphony of precipitation. The chill in the air settles around 49 degrees, rising slightly as if to protect the City by the Bay from the encroaching chill. Amidst the bustling streets, the South Southwest winds whisper at a brisk 9 to 20 mph, occasionally escalating to sharp gusts that echo through the urban canyons.\n\nTomorrow beckons a shift in the atmosphere. While rain may linger until the afternoon, there\u2019s a tentative promise of sunlight piercing through the clouds by day's end, heralding a higher temperature near 55 degrees. As the marine layer retreats, it leaves behind a hint of clarity\u2014a breath of fresh air amidst the lingering moisture. The forecast suggests dressing warmly, with layers draped across your shoulders\u2014perhaps a light waterproof jacket to ward off the lingering chill and a snug scarf to protect against the swirling winds. With the weather set to transform, a leisurely afternoon walk to explore the neighborhood cafes or a slow-paced visit to a local gallery could provide respite from the dampness and a delightful escape into the city\u2019s arts and culture.",
