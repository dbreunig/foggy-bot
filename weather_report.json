    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the quiet yet vibrant city stirs under a sunny sky, promising a delightful day ahead. The warm embrace of early sunlight nudges the temperatures upward, gracefully approaching the high of 70, before settling into a comfortable 66 by the afternoon. A gentle westerly breeze dances through the streets, stirring up the crisp air and carrying the scent of the bay. While the allure of sunshine prevails, there are whispers of the creeping marine layer that frequently wafts over the coastline, a hidden reminder that this city straddles land and sea.\n\nAs the sun dips below the horizon tonight, expect a shift to a more muted ambiance; the clouds will gather, offering a softer light as temperatures settle around a cozy 59. With the wind still nipping at your collar, a light jacket will be your loyal companion throughout the evening. Given these conditions, it\u2019s an ideal time to wander through the charming streets, perhaps stopping by a local cafe to enjoy a warm drink or to share a peaceful moment by the waterfront, where the horizon blurs just enough to invite contemplation. This day invites you to relish the clarity above while keeping an eye on the picturesque clouds that lend a touch of character to the skyline.",
