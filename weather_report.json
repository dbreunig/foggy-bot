As dawn approaches, the city awakens to a gentle whisper of winds, hinting at a lively day to come. Temperatures are cradled around the low fifties, perfect for snuggling into a light layer that can be peeled away as the sun graces the skies.

It\u2019s one of those days where the cool ocean breath meets the warmth of the city, crafting a pleasant tapestry of weather.\n\nAs the morning progresses, one might delight in a leisurely walk along the waterfront, taking care to relish in the crispness of the ocean air. The lack of fog suggests a rare clarity for the region, allowing views to stretch across the bay with a brightness that can lift the spirit.
