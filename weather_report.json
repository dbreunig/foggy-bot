    "weather_report": "As the city quietly stirs awake in the early hours, a blanket of clouds lingers over Downtown San Francisco, wrapping the buildings in a soft, muted gray. The temperature hovers in the mid-fifties, carried by a persistent westerly breeze that whispers through the streets. With the sun yet to fully break through, the day promises a gentle warmth, nudging the high closer to sixty as the hours unfold. However, those clouds hang tightly\u2014though the forecast hints at a clearing later, the morning may still feel a touch damp and cool, especially in the embrace of the waterfront.\n\nAs the sun climbs higher, it aims to scatter the clouds, creating pockets of brilliant blue amidst the lingering gray. The gusty winds, reaching up to thirty-three miles per hour, will remind you of nature\u2019s whispers as you navigate the day. It\u2019s a good time to don a light jacket\u2014perhaps a windbreaker\u2014to fend off the cool, especially if you plan on wandering along the Embarcadero. For a Saturday that might lead to adventure, consider a leisurely morning walk through the Ferry Building Marketplace, where the scent of fresh pastries melds with coffee briskly brewed. As the city shakes off its foggy demeanor, warm yourself with local delights, taking in the vibrant pulse of the town waking up around you.",
