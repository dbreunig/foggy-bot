    "weather_report": "As dawn gently unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a lingering marine layer, wrapping its iconic skyline in a delicate veil of cottony gray. The air carries a whisper of humidity, hinting at the slight chance of drizzle that\u2019s poised to greet early risers. With temperatures hovering around a mild 56 degrees, a soft west-southwest breeze stirs, adding a touch of coolness to the atmosphere. The fog remains an ever-present companion, particularly near the coast, where it curls around the Golden Gate, creating an enchanting yet somewhat elusive horizon.\n\nAs the day progresses, the blanket of clouds will begin to part, revealing patches of blue amid the gray. By midday, expect a shift towards a softer sun, mirroring the city\u2019s own evolution as it awakens in all its vibrant hues. With highs nearing 64 degrees and gentle winds picking up, it's a refreshing day ideal for a stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a leisurely visit to the Ferry Building Marketplace, where the scents of fresh bread and artisanal coffee beckon. Layering is a wise choice, as the brisk morning gives way to warmer noon hours, inviting residents to embrace the city\u2019s temperate charm while keeping a light jacket or sweater at hand for when the sea breeze rolls in later. Today embodies the essence of San Francisco: dynamic, layered, and endlessly inviting.",
