The dawn will come with golden sunlight spilling over the city, promising a delightful day ahead\u2014highs approaching a comfortable 70 degrees, before settling into the late afternoon's embrace around 64. \n\nWith the skies remaining clear tonight, it appears the marine layer has retreated, granting a lovely view\u2014not a hint of fog obscuring the iconic Golden Gate, nor the charming facets of downtown. Dressing in layers would be prudent, perhaps starting with a light jacket for the evening chill, and leaving room for a comfortable shirt beneath for the midday warmth. A stroll through the nearby parks or an invigorating walk along the Embarcadero would feel particularly engaging, as the brisk air refreshes your spirit while the sights of the bay brim with evening twinkles. As the night holds its quiet promise, take a moment to breathe in the anticipation of the day's beauty that awaits.",
