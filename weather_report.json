    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco is shrouded in a delicate layer of cloud, accompanied by gentle drizzles that kiss the pavement. The air, carrying the crisp scent of moisture, accommodates a mild temperature that lingers around the low fiftys. As the sun starts to break free from its nocturnal embrace, anticipation stirs for a more vibrant Wednesday ahead, when patchy drizzle will give way to brilliant streaks of blue. The high will reach a comfortable sixty-eight degrees, with a slight chill lingering in the afternoon, promising a day that ebbs between warmth and cool breezes.\n\nIn the midst of patchy clouds, the city glows with a soft luminescence, yet the Golden Gate remains partially concealed, as if teasing those eager for a full view. While the morning may awaken subdued and misty, as the day unfolds, it may encourage a leisurely stroll through the park or a quiet moment at a favorite caf\u00e9, cozy yet breathable layers ideal for the shifting temperatures. The crispness in the air invites a collection of textures and light fabrics, perfect for embracing the day's gentle transitions. Though the marine layer lingers, its charm reminds us that in this city, clarity is often just a moment away, and the promise of sun will soon paint the skyline with clarity and warmth.",
