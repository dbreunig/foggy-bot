    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, this morning unfolds under a serene sky, kissed by golden rays. As the day progresses, you may notice the temperature gently dipping from a promising high of 72, settling comfortably around 70, with a light southwest breeze offering a pleasant touch. The air remains clear, revealing the city\u2019s stunning architecture and the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge. Yet, a whisper of fog clings to the bay, hinting at the marine layer that is both a familiar friend and a soft reminder of the city\u2019s coastal embrace.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent, expect a tranquil evening with the thermometer sliding down to a mild 53. The twilight will invite coolness, so a light jacket or sweater will suffice as you step out to enjoy the charm of the streets adorned in evening glow. Whether it\u2019s a casual stroll through a park, sipping a warm drink at a cozy caf\u00e9, or simply catching the end of the day by the waterfront, the conditions are just right for a celebration of simple pleasures on this beautiful San Francisco day.",
