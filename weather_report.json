    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds with the gentle embrace of sunshine warming the streets, as temperatures hover near a pleasant 70 degrees before gracefully dipping around 66 in the afternoon. The west-southwest breeze, playful yet steady at 10 to 21 mph, sweeps through the city, bringing forth gusts that whisper up to 25 mph. While the sun reigns overhead, you may notice a few stubborn wisps of marine layer that cling to the skyline. The view, radiant yet unpretentious, speaks of a classic San Francisco day, where the horizon reveals a sense of clarity and vitality, promising a delightful experience for all.\n\nAs the sun transitions, expect the evening to bring a soft, partly cloudy sky\u2014a kind note from the city\u2019s evening persona. With temperatures dipping to a comfy 56 degrees, it beckons for light layers; perhaps a sweater or a light jacket would be the perfect companion for your twilight stroll along the waterfront. The wind will still dance around you, carrying the briny scent of the ocean. Opt to explore the local cafes or meander through the charming streets, allowing the echoes of the day to fade into the night under the twinkling San Francisco skyline.",
