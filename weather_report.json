    "weather_report": "As dawn whispers through the streets of Downtown San Francisco, there\u2019s a gentle promise of a day still cradled in a misty embrace. The air feels soft, hinting at rain that may tap on rooftops in the overnight hours. Currently, the sky is mostly clouded over, though there\u2019s an expectation of fleeting sunlight amidst the grey. The morning brings with it a low of around 62 degrees, and in the wake of a prevalent marine layer, visibility may dance between clarity and concealment, especially towards the western skies around the Golden Gate.\n\nThe forecast for Tuesday hints at continued chances of rain showers up until 5 pm. As the day progresses, the temperature is likely to inch closer to a mild 68, with southwest winds stirring lightly, rustling leaves and perhaps carrying the scent of the Pacific into the city. So, as you plan your day, consider layering up; a light jacket will serve you well against the cool breeze, while an umbrella may prove a faithful companion should those rain showers emerge. A stroll along the waterfront or a quiet caf\u00e9 retreat could be just the escape to savor this uniquely San Francisco moment, where the dance of fog and sun tells a story all its own.",
