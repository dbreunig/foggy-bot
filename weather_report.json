    "weather_report": "A gentle sun bathes downtown San Francisco as the day unfolds, bathing the city in warm, golden light. The air is clear, with visibility stretching towards the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge, and a light southwest breeze dances through the streets, adding a vibrant energy to the atmosphere. While the day promises a high nearing 71, there\u2019s a gentle reminder of the coolness that will settle in later. As the afternoon draws near, temperatures will dip to a mellow 69, inviting those out and about to have a light jacket at the ready for evening strolls.\n\nTonight, the sky will don a partly cloudy veil, with a low around 60, and the winds will whisper through the streets, their gusts still echoing the vitality of the day. Perfect padding for this temperate climate, perhaps a light sweater or a casual shawl would fit wonderfully into the evening\u2019s plans. One might consider a quiet walk along the Embarcadero, where the rippling bay reflects the setting sun. Or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 to indulge in a warm drink, savoring the gentle transition from day to night, a reminder that San Francisco's beauty does not fade as the sun dips below the horizon.",
