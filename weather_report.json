    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth begins to seep through the streets, promising a day graced with sunshine and mildness. The high will hover around comfortable sixty-five, breathing an invigorating lightness into the air. A light breeze from the west-southwest carries the salt of the sea and the whispers of the city, but there\u2019s no heavy fog to cloak the shores; instead, visibility is clear, inviting the wanderers and the curious alike. \n\nThis evening, as the sun dips below the horizon, a soft blanket of clouds will roll in, ushering in a cooler embrace with temperatures settling around fifty-three. For today, it\u2019s best to don layers that can breathe with you\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a tee and comfortable pants, complemented by a light windbreaker for moments when the breeze comes calling. With the pleasant weather, consider a leisurely stroll through one of the many parks, perhaps catching up with a friend over coffee or indulging in a moment of quiet in the sun, away from the bustle of life. As day transforms into evening, the city will gently transition, calm and inviting, a reminder of the beauty that lies within the routine.",
