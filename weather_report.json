    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, an expansive quietude cloaks the city, broken only by the gentle murmur of wind. Tonight, the skies are mostly clear, allowing for the ethereal shimmer of city lights to beckon like stars scattered across the earth. The temperature drifts towards a cool 48, inviting a light jacket or a cozy sweater to ward off the night's chill, while a whisper of an easterly breeze sweeps through, barely noticeable but present nonetheless. \n\nAs the dawn breaks on Wednesday, the city promises a sunny embrace, with temperatures ascending to a comfortable 68, gradually mellowing to around 65 by afternoon. The forecast hints at a day unmarred by fog, yet an observant passerby might still find whispers of the marine layer lurking at the city's edges. It is a splendid time to be outdoors, perhaps indulging in a stroll along the Embarcadero or sinking into a caf\u00e9's warmth with a good book in tow. The sun should shine brightly, illuminating faces and spirits alike, making it a delightful day to savor the simple joy of urban life.",
