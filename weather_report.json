    "weather_report": "Afternoon sun blankets Downtown San Francisco with a soothing warmth, the kind that nudges the city from its foggy slumber into a vibrant clarity. As you gaze towards the Golden Gate, you can appreciate the dramatic contrast of cobalt skies against the surrounding landscape. The cool, brisk West wind adds an invigorating snap, rustling through the streets and lifting the spirits of those who wander. Though the forecast hints at a high near 62, the gentle descent to around 60 as the afternoon light wanes towards evening will serve as a reminder to bring along a light jacket.\n\nTonight, expect the sky to maintain its clarity, the temperature easing into a comfortable embrace at around 52. The wind from the west northwest will continue to dance through the evening, promising a refreshing respite. For those venturing out, a casual yet layered outfit will keep the chill at bay as you stroll through the neighborhood or sip something warm at a sidewalk caf\u00e9. Perhaps an afternoon hike on one of the local trails would be ideal, where the beauty of the surroundings can be savored in the golden light. As dusk deepens, its fading shadows make way for a cozy evening indoors or an engaging night out\u2014whatever your mood beckons as the city glimmers softly under the vast expanse of the clear sky.",
