    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in a gentle, cool breeze, with its atmosphere decidedly clear, yet faint traces of fog linger at the city's edges, hinting at the embrace of the Pacific. The temperature hovers comfortably, a mere breath away from chilly, as the last rays of sunlight dissolve into the horizon. Tonight\u2019s sky will keep mostly clear, save for scattered stars waiting to grace the evening, under which the breeze whispers softly, a warm invitation to still venture outside.\n\nTomorrow, as the sun begins to rise, expect a contrasting shift. The forecast calls for rain likely to begin in the late afternoon, mixing with a soft sun peeking through the clouds, providing a fleeting duality of weather. Above, the skies may develop a shroud of grey, ready to disperse gentle droplets in unison. For those dressed in layers, this transition calls for both comfort and practicality: a light jacket and perhaps a sturdy umbrella for precaution. As daylight wanes later in the afternoon, consider an early excursion, a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm beverage or a leisurely stroll through the city streets, perhaps seeking shelter from the impending drizzle while savoring a good book or quiet conversation. In this ever-changing confluence of fog and sunlight, San Francisco remains inviting, offering a bittersweet charm as it prepares for the dance of rain.",
