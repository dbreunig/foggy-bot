As the warmth gradually embraces you with a high lingering around 71 degrees, the beckoning sun softens into a gentle afternoon crest, cooling to about 68. A playful wind dances from the west, whispering secrets of the bay, while occasional gusts remind us of nature's presence. The sky above is an impressive canvas of deep azure, unmarred by a hint of fog for now, though the soft embrace of the marine layer lingers just beyond the bridge\u2014a reminder of its ever-changing temperament.\n\nAs the early afternoon unfolds, it\u2019s a delightful day for a stroll. You might consider light layers: a comfortable shirt beneath a light jacket, allowing you to transition effortlessly as the sun warms your skin before the evening coolness descends to around 57 degrees. This is an ideal time to visit a local caf\u00e9, perhaps, to sip a leisurely coffee while basking in the lively atmosphere of the streets, or to meander through a nearby park, where laughter and the rustle of leaves lull the senses. A late afternoon wander through the bustling waterfront could serve as a charming close to your day\u2014not a moment wasted on cliches, just the unfolding joy of being alive in this beautiful city.",
