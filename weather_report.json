Highs will reach near 58, with temperatures gently easing back to around 56 as the afternoon unfolds.\n\nWhile the forecast hints at the absence of fog, the coastal embrace leaves a subtle marine layer lurking in the shadows of the Golden Gate. The clarity of the day suggests a pleasant outing is well within reach. To best enjoy this transitional weather, layering would be wise\u2014a light sweater or jacket in the morning, perhaps shedding it for a tee as the sun warms your path in the afternoon. A walk along the waterfront, a quiet coffee at a quaint caf\u00e9, or exploring the neighborhood's hidden nooks would be splendid activities to indulge in on this serene Saturday.",
