    "weather_report": "As the sun dips below the horizon, a gentle veil of clouds cloaks the bay, lending a tranquil aura to Downtown San Francisco. Tonight, the air carries a soft chill, whispering hints of spring's approach. The temperature settles around a cozy 54, inviting a light layer to ward off the evening coolness. A subtle breeze from the west-southwest lingers, enhancing the serene atmosphere of the city\u2019s backdrop.\n\nAs we peer into the morrow, the prospect of rain lightly beckons after 5 PM. The day promises a dance of partly sunny skies with a high reaching towards 62, yet the horizon holds a touch of uncertainty; a 40% chance of brief showers punctuates the afternoon. The south-southwest breezes will likely stir comfortably, perhaps rustling the leaves in the nearby park. With clouds forming along the coastline, glimpses of fog may gather around the classic silhouette of the Golden Gate, hinting at the marine layer subtly creeping inland. Preparing for the day ahead, layering becomes essential; a light jacket or sweater paired with casual attire will suit the shifting conditions. Such a day would be an ideal time to wander through hidden alleyways of the city, perhaps stopping at a quiet caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or enjoying the fresh air on a walk through the nearby botanical gardens. Embrace the gentle unpredictability of these San Francisco days, where every moment offers a unique beauty to savor.",
