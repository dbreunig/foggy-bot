As temperatures hover around a comfortable 64 degrees, there\u2019s a hint of a cool breeze from the west, perfect for those seeking a light reprieve from the day\u2019s hustle. The sky above is mostly clear, allowing for that familiar blue to punctuate the skyline, with only the barest whispers of marine layer teasing the edges\u2014no significant fog to obscure today\u2019s vistas.\n\nAs evening creeps in, you can anticipate a delightful transition to a pleasant night, with the air cooling to around 50 degrees, making it ideal for a leisurely stroll or a sidewalk caf\u00e9 visit. A light sweater or a light jacket will suffice as a companion against the slight chill that often sweeps through the city. This may be an opportune moment to wander along the waterfront or perhaps explore the quiet charm of local galleries. The energy of the city is inviting yet serene, coaxing you to embrace its evening offerings, where a simple meal or a spontaneous catch-up with friends could easily transform into a cherished memory.",
