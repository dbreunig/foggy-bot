    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the horizon glimmers against a backdrop of muted clouds, the promise of a sunny day evident as tendrils of fog recede from the city\u2019s embrace. With temperatures gently lifting toward the high 60s, there\u2019s a refreshing vigor in the air, whipped by a brisk wind from the west southwest that stirs anticipation for what lies ahead. The sun's rays, poised to break through, promise a vibrant clarity, although the shadows of a soft marine layer still linger in the edges of the skyline, clinging to the iconic structures like memories of the night.\n\nBy afternoon, expect the warm embrace of sunshine, inviting the city\u2019s dwellers outdoors. While the wind continues its playful dance, it may be wise to don a light jacket to ward off the chill that can accompany the breeze, especially in exposed locations. The transition from the cozy comfort of morning to the welcoming warmth of day provides an ideal backdrop for enjoying a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero or settling into a lively caf\u00e9, where the hum of conversation and the aroma of fresh coffee create a perfect marriage of urban life and casual leisure. Embrace the day; it holds the promise of delight in every sunlit moment.",
