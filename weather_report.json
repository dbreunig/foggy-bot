    "weather_report": "As the city breathes in the early hours, Downtown San Francisco is wrapped in a gentle shawl of clouds, tinged with the promise of a crisp, clear Tuesday. The air is cool, hovering comfortably around 49 degrees, with a mild easterly breeze that whispers through the streets. Light moisture lingers first thing, teasing the possibility of a brief shower, though it will soon retreat, leaving in its wake sharp blue skies and the keen outline of buildings against the horizon. \n\nAs the day unfolds, a golden sun will crest the hills, casting light over the streets and livening the mood downtown. By midday, the temperature will gradually cascade, settling around the mid-50s, offering a pleasant respite from the briskness of the morning. One might consider layering with a light jacket or a cozy sweater, ideal for afternoon strolls through the thinly populated parks or quiet caf\u00e9 corners. Those inclined to explore may find joy in meandering through the bustling streets, pausing for a warm cup of coffee, or perhaps indulging in a leisurely lunch on a sunlit terrace. As clouds steadily dissolve, revealing a striking skyline and the majestic slants of the Golden Gate in the distance, the day beckons with a serene clarity, perfect for quiet reflection or a gentle walk along the Embarcadero.",
