Currently, a soft drizzle may flirt with the afternoon sky, though clouds loom heavily, keeping the sun shy beneath their gray embrace. The temperature will find itself settling into a cool farewell as the day progresses, a subtle reminder of the sea's influence. With the west southwest winds caressing the heights at a gentle pace, a sense of calm is apparent, though the chill whispers of a sweater or light jacket\u2014perfect companions for an afternoon stroll.\n\nTonight promises to cradle the city in clouds, draping the skyline in a dusky veil, while cool breezes will encourage layered warmth. Such an atmosphere beckons you to appreciate simple pleasures: perhaps a quiet walk along the waterfront, where the city\u2019s lights flicker against the water\u2019s surface, or a cozy afternoon in a caf\u00e9 with a warm drink to chase away the coolness. The day hints at contemplation and connection rather than hustle, inviting you to slow down and savor the moment amid the city\u2019s ever-present bustle, as the illusion of autumn continues to dance through the air.",
