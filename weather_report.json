    "weather_report": "In the fading light of a San Francisco evening, the air holds a gentle coolness, ideal for unwinding after the day's bustle. Tonight, a partly cloudy sky drapes itself over the city, with a whisper of wind from the southwest, rustling through the streets, carrying hints of the ocean's breath. The temperature settles comfortably around 55, inviting one to don a light sweater or wrap, complementing the soft night. As the sun bows out, the allure of a cozy caf\u00e9 beckons, perhaps with a window seat to watch the twilight deepen.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Friday, the city awakens to a promise of sun-drenched skies and warmth. The temperature climbs to a pleasant near 70, before gracefully easing down to around 67 in the afternoon, a gentle reminder of the often capricious microclimates that grace this remarkable city. The southwest winds continue to play, strengthening slightly, encouraging a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a tranquil park, where the lush greenery is kissed by the sun. Dress in layers, ideally starting with a light shirt and topped with a jacket that can be shed as the sun climbs higher. The day is tailored for quiet pleasures; a visit to a local gallery or reading in a sun-dashed corner could be just the thing to embrace the day\u2019s warmth and clarity, relishing the beauty that San Francisco unfailingly offers.",
