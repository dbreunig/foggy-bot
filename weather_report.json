    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon sun struggles to cast its warmth over a landscape touched by the lingering remnants of winter. While there\u2019s only a slight chance of rain before the clock strikes five, the skies overhead reveal a canvas of mottled clouds, hinting at a playful dance between sun and shadow. The temperature remains cool, hovering around sixty, while a gentle west wind brushes through the streets, offering a fresh breath of air. This moment invites casual wanderers to enjoy the city's charms, perhaps with a light jacket as their companion against the crispness.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect the horizon to soften into a shroud of patchy fog after four. The clarity of the day may give way to a gentle mist, wrapping city corners in a romantic embrace. When night falls, temperatures will dip into the low forties, beckoning a cozy atmosphere perfect for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or quiet evenings in cozy caf\u00e9s. For those journeying tonight, a soft sweater or light scarf may add comfort and style as the city whispers its nocturnal secrets. Embrace this blend of sun and fog, where each corner of San Francisco reveals a layer of beauty worth exploring.",
