    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, a gentle cloud cover blankets the city, giving a soft, muted glow as the evening settles in. The temperature lingers at a mild 52 degrees, with a subtle southwest breeze nudging at a friendly 7 miles per hour. As the clock ticks toward a new day, the ambiance is calm, and the city exudes a quiet charm, ideal for a leisurely stroll through the nearby streets or perhaps a late-night caf\u00e9 visit, where you can savor the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee.\n\nWhen morning arrives, expect the clouds to part slightly, revealing patches of sunshine that will linger throughout the day. With a high around 61 degrees, the weather promises a delightful respite from the chill of the night. As you step outside, the air carries a hint of moisture, a gentle reminder of the coastal winds, while the horizon may still harbor strands of fog lingering just beyond the Golden Gate Bridge. This invokes a sense of adventure, inviting you to don a light jacket layered over a favorite sweater\u2014enough protection for the brisk air but not too burdensome for the warmth of the sun that\u2019s bound to grace the day. Perhaps an afternoon stroll to explore local markets or a quiet moment in a park with a book could round out a lovely Tuesday. With such conditions, the city unfolds inviting opportunities for both relaxation and simple pleasures.",
