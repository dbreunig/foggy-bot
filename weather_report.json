The gentle whisper of a westward breeze at about ten miles per hour keeps the moment rejuvenating, painting a sense of casual delight across the city streets. As evening approaches, whispers of the marine layer will drape the horizon, predictably rolling in after 4 a.m., transforming the skyline with a soft, ethereal fog, which will blend with the starry sky, awaiting the night\u2019s embrace.\n\nAs twilight descends, temperatures are expected to dip to around 50 degrees\u2014a gentle reminder of the city's cool coastal charms. A light southwest wind will accompany this transition, which invites layers into the evening's fashion; a light jacket or a cozy sweater will suffice as you stroll city sidewalks or unwind with friends at an outdoor caf\u00e9. Consider meandering through the residential neighborhoods, where the pastel hues of Victorian homes provide a picturesque backdrop, or perhaps take a peaceful moment at a nearby park, savoring the fading light and lingering warmth while enjoying the simple pleasures of shared conversation.",
