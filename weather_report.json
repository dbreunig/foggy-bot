There\u2019s a gentle chill in the air, a nod to the marine layer that drifts close to the hills, yet already, clarity is asserting itself as the day begins to awaken. As the sun climbs, it promises warmth, aiming for a pleasant high around sixty-eight degrees, yet caution your layers; pockets of chill may still linger, especially in shaded spots as they yield to the light.\n\nFor those venturing outside, a light jacket will offer comfort against the lingering cool. Perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero would be invigorating\u2014enjoy a caf\u00e9, or simply allow yourself to be swept into the scenes of morning activity. As the city transitions, wrapped in this splendid balance of fog and sunshine, the charm of San Francisco will be at your fingertips, inviting exploration and quiet reflection in equal measure. In this moment where chill meets the potential of the sunny afternoon, every corner beckons to be discovered anew.",
