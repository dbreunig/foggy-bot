    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a delicate clarity envelops the cityscape, a juxtaposition to the lingering chill of the early morning air. The skies are mostly clear, granting the first rays of sunlight a chance to stretch luxuriously over rooftops and through narrow streets, promising a tranquil day ahead. There\u2019s a gentle north-northwest wind whispering through the avenues, underlining the cool temperature, which hovers around 45 degrees. The forecast hints at a sunny progression throughout the day, with a high reaching 61\u2014though slipping to a crisp 58 in the afternoon. \n\nThough the bright conditions are expected to hold, one might still keep an eye toward the horizon, for early reports suggest the presence of fog draping the hills beyond the Golden Gate, a soft marine layer that serves as a reminder of San Francisco's ever-changing nature. As the day unfolds, a comfortable layering of light sweaters or jackets would suffice, enabling a sense of preparedness for both early briskness and the eventual warmth of midafternoon sunshine. This could be the perfect time for a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s, indulging in a warm drink while savoring the gentle transition from night to day.",
