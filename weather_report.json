    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks softly over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity settles in with the promise of a lovely day ahead. The air carries a mild chill, resting comfortably at around 58 degrees, as a soft southwest breeze whispers through the streets. As the sun ascends, it will usher in a delightful warmth, the temperature climbing tenderly towards 74, eventually softening to a cool embrace of 72 by afternoon. \n\nThough the morning may carry a hint of haze, the forecast hints at a mostly sunny day, suggesting that the infamous San Francisco fog will likely remain at bay, leaving the sky open and inviting for exploration. Dress in layers; a light jacket will serve well for the cooler morning but should give way to lighter clothing as the sun warms the city. Consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps enjoying coffee from a local caf\u00e9, letting the day unfold around you. For those craving a bit more activity, a walk through the enveloping green of Golden Gate Park could offer a serene escape, filled with the gentle rustle of leaves and the soft splashes of fountains, making the most of this pleasantly mild San Francisco day.",
