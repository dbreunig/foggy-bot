    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth replaces the morning coolness, awakening the city beneath a brilliant blue sky devoid of fog. The sun shines brightly, illuminating the iconic skyline and casting distinct shadows that peak around the rooftops, as friendly breezes from the west play through the streets. Temperatures hover in the comfortable mid-sixties, evoking a sense of ease that invites residents and visitors alike to indulge in leisurely pursuits.\n\nTonight will bring a soothing clarity as the sky remains mostly clear, perfect for an evening stroll or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the nearby parks, where you might feel the soft brush of a fading sunshine against your skin. A light cardigan or a soft jacket will serve well against the mild evening chill, while a cup of warm tea or coffee would complement the gentle atmosphere. Consider meandering through local shops, savoring a moment of stillness, or finding a cozy space to listen to live music, letting the rhythms of the day carry you into the calm embrace of the night.",
