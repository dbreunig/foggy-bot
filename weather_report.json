    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a truce between the sky and the sea births a tapestry of passing clouds. Tonight's air lingers at a comfortable 52 degrees, cooled gently by a west-southwest wind, pushing through the streets with a refreshing vigor. You might notice the gusts, playfully tousling hair and ruffling garments. While a mostly clouded sky veils the stars, the promise of a serene night lingers in the air; the fog has not yet made its claim on the city tonight, allowing the lights of the city to flicker like a field of stars below.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will grace us with its presence, setting the tone for a day that promises warmth and clarity. As temperatures rise toward a pleasant 61, the winds will dance across your skin, reminding you of the ocean not far away. The morning may start with a light fog clinging briefly to the coast, but expect it to lift, revealing the vibrancy of the city. As you plan your day, consider light layers\u2014a comfortable sweater or jacket will ease the transition from the waning warmth of dusk into the invigorating brightness of the afternoon. A perfect time to stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping at hidden cafes or quiet parks, enjoying the simple pleasures of a city waking anew in the morning light.",
