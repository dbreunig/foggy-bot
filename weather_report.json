    "weather_report": "Afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a pristine blue sky, kissed by gentle breezes that carry the scent of salt from the bay. The temperature hovers comfortably in the low sixties, with a promise of slightly cooler moments ahead as the sun makes its descent. The iconic skyline stands bold and clear, unmarred by the usual marine haze, though the whispering hint of fog lingers in the distance, perhaps clinging affectionately to the Golden Gate. As the daylight wanes into evening, expect a soft shift to partly cloudy skies, casting a tranquil gray that will escort the sun away, with temperatures dipping to a cooler fifty-one.\n\nFor those venturing outside, light layers will be your ally; a light jacket should suffice against the mild breeze, perfect for an afternoon stroll along the Embarcadero or a casual gathering at a local caf\u00e9. Given the clarity of the day and the approachable chill of the evening, one might find joy in a leisurely walk to watch the sun\u2019s descent, perhaps followed by a cozy dinner al fresco. This is a day that invites exploration, offering the charm of the city at its most inviting, perfect for savoring the moment while the world quietly unfolds around you.",
