    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the sky bears a blend of clouds, softening the fading daylight into a gentle twilight. The temperature lingers around the mild 55 degrees, a reminder of the cool breath of the west-southwest winds that rustle through the streets. With gusts reaching up to 25 mph, there\u2019s a playful energy in the air, an invitation from the city to embrace its dynamic essence. The remnants of the day retreat gently, yet the apparent clarity of the air hints at a fleeting whisper of fog, a light marine layer that may lend a touch of mystique to the evening.\n\nTomorrow promises a partly sunny disposition, with temperatures peaking near 64 before gradually descending. The afternoon might bring a tempered coolness, which demands a thoughtful approach to attire; layers become your trusted allies. A light sweater, perhaps, paired with comfortable jeans seems ideal for those venturing out to admire the golden hues of sunset or savor a meal at one of the beloved caf\u00e9s nearby. The lively winds usher in a spirit of adventure; whether you find yourself wandering the waterfront or simply enjoying a quiet moment in one of the city's tranquil parks, the conditions beckon you to revel in the simple pleasures of a summer evening in San Francisco.",
