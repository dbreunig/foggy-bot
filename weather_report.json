    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls over San Francisco, clouds linger quietly, draping the city in a gentle shroud of gray. The temperature hovers around a crisp 54 degrees, accompanied by a moderate breeze from the west-southwest that stirs the air with a whisper of coolness, hinting at the promising warmth behind the clouds. As the day unfolds, expect the sun to break through with radiant brilliance, casting an inviting glow over the bustling streets. By midday, the temperature will rise to a comfortable 66 degrees, settling to a more relaxed 64 as afternoon approaches, while uplifting gusts of wind will playfully dance around, occasionally reaching up to 25 mph.\n\nThough the fog may be absent for now, the marine layer could recede to offer a clearer view, especially towards afternoon, revealing the mesmerizing silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and the iconic skyline. Dress accordingly: a light jacket over a soft sweater would be ideal for the morning chill, shedding layers as midday warmth encourages a more casual attire. Today beckons with opportunities as the pleasant weather invites a leisurely stroll through the Presidio, perhaps indulging in a well-brewed coffee while taking in the stunning vistas. Alternatively, an afternoon visit to one of the city's art galleries could provide a cultural retreat, allowing you to revel in creativity as the sun casts playful shadows across the beautifully curated spaces.",
