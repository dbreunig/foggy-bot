    "weather_report": "As the clock nears midnight in Downtown San Francisco, the landscape is shrouded in a gentle embrace of clouds, softly muffling the distant sounds of the city. Tonight's low hangs around 54 degrees, with a light west-southwest wind whispering through the streets, inviting you to luxuriate in the cool, crisp air. The marine layer breathes a touch of mystery, mingling subtly with the city lights, a reminder of the bay\u2019s ever-present presence.\n\nCome Sunday, the skies promise a transformation; the sun will break through to unveil a day painted in shades of blue and soft gold, as temperatures reach a maximum of 65 degrees before gracefully receding to a balmy afternoon of 63. The breeze will pick up, swirling in patterns as it gusts to 22 mph, perfect for those who relish a leisurely stroll or perhaps a bicycle ride along the Embarcadero. A light jacket will suffice to keep the chill at bay in the morning, transitioning seamlessly to a comfortable sweater or a long-sleeve shirt by midday. \n\nThis day calls for small indulgences: perhaps sipping a warm beverage at an open-air caf\u00e9, exploring the curving pathways of Golden Gate Park, or wandering through the Andy Goldsworthy installation at the de Young Museum. As the sunlight casts its glow on the waterfront, it\u2019s a splendid opportunity to lose oneself in the simple pleasures of a San Francisco summer afternoon.",
