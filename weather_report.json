    "weather_report": "In the gentle embrace of the evening, Downtown San Francisco reveals a mostly clear sky, inviting a soft, cool breeze that sweeps in from the west. The temperatures hover around a comfortable 57 degrees, making it a perfect opportunity for a leisurely stroll through the city\u2019s iconic streets. As dusk unfolds, the wind whispers promises of fresh air, while light gusts of up to 18 mph provide a lively rhythm to the atmosphere. \n\nLooking ahead to the morrow, the sun will grace the city with warmth, reaching a high near 70. The morning will offer the clarity of clear skies, though a gentle fall in temperature is expected as the day softens into afternoon. For those venturing out, a light sweater or jacket is advisable as temperatures dip, particularly when catching those refreshing winds. The day ahead seems ripe for simple pleasures: perhaps discovering a hidden caf\u00e9, savoring a book at a local park, or enjoying a walk along the waterfront, where the sun meets the shimmering bay and the scent of salt lingers in the air.",
