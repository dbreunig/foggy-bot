Today\u2019s high reaches a comfortable 70 degrees, dipping a bit as the afternoon rolls in, yet maintaining a gentle warmth that encourages one to revel in the outdoors. The sky is a clear blue, unmarred by fog\u2014an unusual treat, as the coastal tendrils typically weave their way across the skyline at this hour. Instead, a light west-northwest breeze carries the playful energy of the day; it flutters through the streets, rustling leaves, whispering hints of the vibrant greenery that blooms in the nearby parks.\n\nTonight, we can expect the skies to remain mostly clear, inviting a serene ambiance for evening strolls or quiet reflections on a favorite bench. The temperature will settle around a mild 51 degrees, so dressing in layers is advisable. Perhaps a light jacket over a comfortable shirt and slacks will offer the perfect balance of comfort and warmth as dusk descends. This is an excellent occasion for a leisurely walk along the waterfront, savoring the city's unique charm or stopping by a cozy caf\u00e9 to enjoy a warm drink while the gentle breeze carries the scent of the Pacific.",
