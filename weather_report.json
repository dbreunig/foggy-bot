    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries the promise of gentle rain, merging with the lingering coolness, whispering of low skies around 50 degrees. The city, veiled in a soft layer of clouds, conveys a sense of intimacy. A modest west wind makes its presence known, rustling branches and offering a reminder of the Pacific\u2019s ever-watchful embrace. The chance of precipitation may be slight, yet there\u2019s a subtle charm in the anticipation of those fleeting droplets.\n\nAs dawn approaches tomorrow, the character of the day will shift, revealing partly sunny skies that invite the warm sun to break free, hinting at a high near 59 degrees. The expected westerly breeze will add a refreshing touch to the air, perfect for light layers. A sense of comfort permeates the streets, ideal for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s sunny cafes. Whether you opt for a light jacket or a cozy sweater, tomorrow promises a pleasant respite from tonight's clouds, beckoning you to enjoy the vibrancy of the San Francisco spirit.",
