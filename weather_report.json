    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning light spills softly over the city, painting it in gentle hues of blue and white. With a mild forecast signaling a high near 71, the air feels pleasantly cool, yet warm enough to invite leisurely wanderings. As the sun begins its ascent, it breaks through the clouds, casting a hopeful glow over the Golden Gate, while the shadows retreat in its embrace. A light north-northwest breeze of about seven miles per hour stirs the air, providing a refreshing touch as it mingles with the lingering scents of the bay.\n\nAs the day progresses, you may find the temperatures subtly shifting, falling to around 66 but still inviting for a stroll. The evening beckons with promises of clear skies and temperatures settling around 52. Tonight, as the clouds partly blanket the city, they can create a tender, muted light that lends a serene ambiance to the evening streets. Dressing in layers is prudent today; a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the developing evening chill, while a soft scarf might add comfort against the crisp air. As the day unfolds, consider roaming the waterfront, perhaps enjoying a bit of reading at one of the harbor\u2019s cozy cafes, or simply meandering through the neighborhoods, letting the rhythm of the city guide your steps.",
