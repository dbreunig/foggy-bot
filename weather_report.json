    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle whisper of rain teases the air, promising a hint of moisture amid the chill. The low temperature, hovering around 46 degrees, invites cozy layers, perhaps a soft sweater paired with a light jacket to fend off the brisk west-northwest breeze that occasionally flirts with gusts up to 20 mph. The sky, partially veiled in clouds, offers a delicate canvas where the possibility of rain showers stirs a hushed anticipation, with a modest 40% chance of precipitation lingering overhead.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the morning may greet you with sporadic rain, gradually yielding to a more amiable day as the sun breaks through the clouds. With a high of about 56 degrees, the allure of mostly sunny skies will make itself known by afternoon, a pleasant change from the earlier predictions. The day calls for casual yet comfortable attire\u2014perhaps a long-sleeve shirt, perfect for the coolness of the morning but light enough as warmth settles in. Given the nearly persistent marine layer, the fog may cling to the edges of the iconic views, lending an ethereal quality to the landscape. For those seeking solace or stimulation, an afternoon stroll along the Embarcadero is recommended, where the interplay of light upon water dances in contrast to the urban backdrop, offering both a serene escape and a hint of vibrancy as the city awakens to its mixed forecast.",
