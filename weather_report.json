    "weather_report": "As night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle rhythm of isolated rain showers lingers before 11 PM, painting the evening air with a sprinkle of moisture. The chill sets in, cloaked in a subdued layer of clouds, offering a comfortable embrace at around 50 degrees. A westward breeze whispers through the streets, inviting you to wrap up snugly in a light jacket, perhaps with a cozy scarf to fend off the brisk draft. The chance of precipitation hangs in the air like unmade plans, just 20 percent, yet it stirs a sense of uncertain anticipation.\n\nTomorrow bids a warm welcome, revealing a sunlit canvas as the day unfolds. A high near 62 awaits, gently coaxing the city from its cool repose. With winds stirring from the west-northwest, it\u2019ll be a delightful opportunity to breathe in the freshness of the early day. The horizon will clear, allowing sunbeams to dance across the familiar skyline, inviting quiet strolls along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to your favorite caf\u00e9 for a steaming cup of coffee. There\u2019s an exuberance woven into the fabric of tomorrow\u2014a chance to embrace the outdoors, weather permitting, before the golden evening slips behind the hills.",
