    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun shines brightly, illuminating the city with a gentle warmth, inviting residents to step outside and embrace the day. With a high hovering near the mid-60s, it feels pleasantly mild, accompanied by a west-southwest breeze that whips through the streets at speeds that can refresh a weary spirit. While the day feels largely clear, the familiar San Francisco fog dances around the edges of the golden vista, lingering closer to the coast and hinting at the ocean's embrace. \n\nAs the sun sets, expect a gradual shift into a luminous twilight, giving way to a mostly clear night where temperatures will dip to a comfortable low. Dressing in layers is wise, for while the day may bring warmth, the cool evening air can arrive unexpectedly, making a light jacket or scarf a smart addition. Whether it\u2019s a leisurely stroll down to the waterfront or settling into a cozy caf\u00e9 with a good book, the charm of the city remains unyielding, urging you to savor the simple pleasures of an evening in San Francisco.",
