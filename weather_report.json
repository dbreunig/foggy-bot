    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle rain begins to fall, enveloping the city in a cool embrace. The skies are predominantly overcast, shrouding the familiar skyline in a muted gray, with temperatures settling around a pleasantly cool 52 degrees. It's an evening suited for warmth and comfort, suggesting a cozy retreat with warm layers and perhaps a favorite book. As raindrops tap softly on windows, those venturing outside will embrace the soothing cadence, best equipped with a water-resistant jacket and perhaps a soft scarf.\n\nMoving into Thursday, the morning may start off with lingering rain, tapering to moments of sun peeking through by the afternoon. A high of around 59 degrees hints at the promise of brighter skies, though temperatures are expected to cool slightly later in the day. The brisk winds will remind you of the gentle touch of the ocean nearby, urging a layered outfit that includes a light sweater beneath a sturdy jacket to adapt to both the chill and the sun's occasional warmth. A walk along the waterfront, savoring a hot cup of coffee, or a quiet stroll through a local park could be a delightful way to embrace the changing weather, simple moments that truly capture the essence of a San Francisco day under shifting skies.",
