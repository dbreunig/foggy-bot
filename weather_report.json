    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this Memorial Day, the atmosphere is a meld of crisp clarity and refreshing breezes. With skies resolutely sunny above, one might find the high creeping towards a comfortable 62 degrees. Yet, the subtle stir of a westerly wind\u2014an invigorating 21 mph\u2014whispers a promise of coastal chill, which serves as a reminder of the city\u2019s penchant for maritime moods. As evening approaches, the temperatures will gently descend toward a mild 51, ushering in a stillness that encourages a reflective stroll or a gathering with friends over warm drinks.\n\nThe day offers a splendid backdrop for leisurely pursuits. One might wander along the Embarcadero, dipping into a waterfront caf\u00e9 to savor fresh pastries and aromatic coffee, while taking note of the iconic bridge that silhouettes against the blue. Dressing in layers is wise; a light sweater or jacket pairs well with the soothing sun during the day, as you may find yourself in need of a cozy layer once dusk arrives and the winds begin their dance. Whether you find joy in the vibrant city life or seek solace in nature\u2019s embrace at nearby parks, it is a day that beckons quiet appreciation and mild adventure beneath the vast, open sky.",
