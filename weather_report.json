    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfurls over downtown San Francisco, the skies wear a cloak of clouds, casting a muted light upon the streets. The temperature hovers around a cool 58 degrees, with hints of a chill that will soon deepen as the day gives way to night. There\u2019s a gentle breeze whispering through the city, a reminder of the coming change. Tonight, the forecast brings the promise of rain, with the stillness poised to break around 11 pm, when dampness will envelop the city. \n\nIn this transient moment, visualize dressing in layers \u2014 a light sweater under a rainproof jacket may serve well against the creeping chill. As the sun softly dips and the clouds churn, consider winding your way through the storied streets, perhaps seeking solace in a quaint caf\u00e9, where the aroma of roasted coffee mingles with the ambient chatter. You might choose to explore galleries, letting art captivate your thoughts while the world outside prepares for a drenching. This is a time for quiet pursuits, where one can watch the patterns of impending rain draw across the skyline, reflecting upon the beauty of a city that embraces both sun and storm with equal grace.",
