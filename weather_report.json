    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun casts a warm glow over Downtown San Francisco, with temperatures gently balancing near 70 degrees, inviting a sense of calm and comfort. As the clear azure sky unfolds, the soft percussive whisper of the west-southwest wind dances through the streets, perfectly timed to carry away the lingering warmth of the day. While the sun beams brightly, the city will soon witness the coastal fog rolling in after midnight, creating a gentle veil that will drift into the night, soothing the vibrancy of the day into a tranquil embrace.\n\nWith cooler temperatures in the evening reaching around 56 degrees, it\u2019s wise to layer up for the descent into nightfall; consider a light jacket or sweater for those crisp evening strolls. The elusive charm of this city invites you to wander its streets, perhaps discovering a cozy caf\u00e9 to enjoy a warm beverage or taking a leisurely walk to breathe in the freshness, all while the soft rustle of fog begins to awaken the sleepy corners of the city. Tonight, as the haze settles, the city promises a scene of haunting beauty, reminiscent of dreams wrapped in sea air and soft whispers.",
