    "weather_report": "As the city breathes softly in the earliest hours of the morning, a gentle blanket of clouds envelops Downtown San Francisco, painting the sky with shades of muted gray. The air, cool and crisp at 54 degrees, carries the playful whispers of a west-southwest wind at 14 mph. A quiet allure envelops this atmospheric canvas, making the city feel somewhat introspective, offering moments for reflection as it gradually shakes off the remnants of the night.\n\nAs the sun rises higher, the day promises a transformation, revealing patches of brilliant blue that will greet the city by midday. Expect temperatures to rise to a comfortable 64 before settling down to 62 later in the afternoon, accompanied by a brisk wind that may gust up to 32 mph, urging one to don a light sweater or jacket, perhaps even a well-tailored hat to ward off the chill. The subtle marine layer may linger, but it will ultimately yield to clearer skies, making it an ideal time to take a leisurely walk along the waterfront. A stroll through the bustling Ferry Building Marketplace could prove delightful, where one might savor a fresh pastry, sip artisan coffee, or gather handmade treasures as the morning blossoms into a lively day.",
