With temperatures nipping at a comfortable 56 degrees, an understated west-southwest breeze, barely whispering at 6 to 10 mph, might hint at the coolness typical of this coastal enclave. The golden lights of the city beckon against the twilight backdrop, their glow enhancing the spirit of the night.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, expect sunny skies that will frame the day with warmth and optimism, reaching a high of around 66 degrees. As the afternoon unfolds, a gradual drop to 64 will maintain a refreshing balance, complemented by a lively breeze that could gust up to 23 mph. The absence of fog allows the skyline to express its full charm, encouraging moments spent outdoors. Attire that blends comfort and style will serve well\u2014perhaps lightweight layers to accommodate the swift shifts in temperature. Consider a leisurely stroll through the Embarcadero, enjoying the transition from the lively bustle of morning to the tranquil embrace of the evening\u2014an everyday adventure decidedly enriched by the day's inviting conditions.",
