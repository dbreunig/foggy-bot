    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the air carries the warmth of sunshine, setting the stage for a pleasantly vibrant afternoon. As the sunlight bathes the city in a golden hue, the temperature gently peaks near 78, before yielding to a comfortable fall toward 73. The breeze dances in from the west, a soft whisper weaving through the streets, hinting at the coastal breath of the bay. As dusk approaches, the sky retains its clear canvas, where the first stars will soon begin to wink awake, and the temperature will glide down to a serene 59 under the cloak of a mostly clear night.\n\nWith such favorable conditions, one might find delight in a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the reflections of the city in the darkening waters offer a soothing display. Perhaps indulge in a cozy evening at a local caf\u00e9, the evenings still warm enough to linger outside with a light sweater. As for attire, light layers will serve best\u2014welcoming the warmth of the day, while allowing for the night\u2019s gentle cool. And as you savor the evenings, let the city's vibrant spirit unfold around you, revealing the charm of a day that promises both warmth and clarity.",
