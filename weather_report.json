    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a pervasive stillness, with the gray sky casting a muted light over the bustling city below. The promise of rain looms, a gentle whisper that has begun to weave through the air, heralded by a cool breeze carrying the scent of damp earth and sea. Visibility is diminished, as the city wears its fog like a soft shawl; the outlines of structures blur into shadows, making the iconic silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and downtown gleam ethereally against the backdrop of cloud cover.\n\nAs the day progresses, anticipate the rain to intensify before mid-afternoon, although it sways between a mild drizzle and a light shower. A modest drop in temperature will accompany the moisture, demanding layers for comfort. A cozy sweater or a light jacket should suffice, complemented by sturdy shoes if one ventures outside\u2014all particularly useful for meandering through a nearby caf\u00e9-laden street or exploring a local bookstore\u2019s nooks. While the conditions might lean toward the bleak side, there's a charm for those willing to seek refuge in warm spaces, where the comfort of coffee and printed words can transform an overcast day into an intimate interlude. Evening arrives with a chance of lingering rain, but the city\u2019s pulse remains vibrant, animated by the glow of street lamps and the continued rhythm of footsteps on wet pavement.",
