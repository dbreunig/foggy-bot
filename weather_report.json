The evening air carries a hint of dampness, with temperatures settling around 61 degrees. A westerly breeze whispers through the streets, barely stirring the silence, offering a cool caress after the warmth of the day. Tonight, the clouds might linger, creating an atmosphere that feels both contemplative and intimate, perfect for cozying up at a local caf\u00e9 or taking a leisurely stroll, perhaps along the waterfront, where the soft glow of city lights reflects upon the bay.\n\nLooking to Monday, the forecast hints at a slight chance of rain showers late in the afternoon, just after five. The skies may open up, allowing for brief moments of rain amidst stretches of sunshine. As the day unfolds with a high near 70, layers will be your ally\u2014perhaps a light jacket to shield against the cool breeze and the off-chance of a shower. This day is ripe for possibilities: savor a mid-morning coffee while watching the day awaken, or explore the E.M. Forster novel of your choice in one of the many parks. With a 20% chance of rain, your plans can dance between practicality and whimsy, embracing the charm of the city\u2019s crisp climate and dynamic ambiance.",
