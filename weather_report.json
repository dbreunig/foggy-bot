    "weather_report": "As the sun prepares to settle beyond the horizon, Downtown San Francisco reveals a canvas painted with hues of golden light and gentle shadows. The weather is decidedly pleasant, with the afternoon air warming to a comfortable 68 degrees, a refreshing breath under a mostly sunny sky. An invigorating west-southwest breeze dances through the streets, playfully tousling hair and ruffling jackets, ensuring that the warmth is neither oppressive nor stifling.\n\nFor tonight, expect a clear sky revealing stars nestled among a cooling breeze, as temperatures dip to a mild 54 degrees. The brisk gusts, reminiscent of ocean whispers, invite one to step outside. The absence of fog and the diminished marine layer offer a rare moment of clarity for the city, making it a perfect evening for a stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet coffee on Union Street while enjoying the twilight glow. A light jacket or sweater might be prudent as the evening deepens, wrapping around you like the gentle embrace of the incoming night.",
