    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the sky hangs heavy with clouds, draping the city in a muted palette that hints at the dampness of the day ahead. As we transition into the afternoon, expect the briskness in the air to accompany a light chance of rain, particularly before four o'clock. The layer of clouds plays guardian to the sun, scattering its warmth, while a gentle breeze nudges the clouds along their journey. The sense of clarity is a rarity today; the view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the cityscape appears softened, obscured by a veil of marine fog, creating an ethereal quality to the horizon.\n\nWith evening approaching, the likelihood of rain swells slightly, signaling that the air, still crisp and cool, is ripe for a light jacket\u2014perhaps something windproof, layered over a cozy sweater. As the afternoon dims into dusk, consider a quiet stroll along the waterfront, where the whispers of the bay mingle with the scents of the sea, or duck into a nearby caf\u00e9, indulging in a warm coffee as you watch the world drift past\u2014a perfect complement to the contemplative mood of the day.",
