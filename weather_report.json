    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth blankets the city, hinting at a pleasant summer day ahead. The sun casts a dependable golden light, painting a canvas where the iconic skyline stands tall against a backdrop of blue. A refreshing west-southwest breeze dances through the streets, carrying whispers of the ocean. This wind, steady yet playful, brings with it a touch of exhilaration, mingling with the vibrant energy of the city. \n\nWhile the sun reigns now, there is an awareness of the marine layer preparing to settle in as twilight approaches. For those venturing outdoors, layers are the day's allies; a light jacket will serve well against the cool evening air that will descend, wrapping the city in a soft embrace. A stroll along the waterfront or through one of the many lively neighborhoods offers an inviting opportunity to savor the warm afternoon light while it lingers. Perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a quiet moment or a simple gathering with friends in one of the nearby parks will bring the day to a satisfying close, as the clouds begin to weave their way into the emerging night.",
