    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the evening air carries a hint of moisture, an unmistakable precursor to the patchy drizzle expected after two o'clock in the morning. With temperatures meandering around 56 degrees, it's a cool, cloudy night, but not entirely unwelcoming. The gentle west-southwest winds whisper through the streets, brushing against the skin with a soft caress that suggests a need for a light jacket or perhaps a cozy sweater, perfect for an evening stroll or a quiet coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the remnants of the night may linger in the form of brief drizzles until late morning, before yielding to partly sunny skies. The forecast hints at highs near 63 degrees, gradually slipping to a cooler 61 by the afternoon. With winds kicking up to 15 mph, the day promises a refreshing breeze. It\u2019s a moment made for leisurely endeavors; perhaps a visit to a local gallery or a wandering through the vibrant streets filled with eclectic shops and caf\u00e9s. For the more adventurous, an early morning run along the waterfront sounds enticing, though one should be prepared for the playful embrace of the marine layer that often dances along the coastal edges. Embrace the conditions with easy elegance, dress in layers, and venture out to savor the unique character of San Francisco\u2019s urban charm.",
