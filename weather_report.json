    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere holds a muted charm beneath a veil of clouds, with temperatures gently settling around 56 degrees. The wind whispers through the streets, brushing past at a moderate pace, and the occasional gust evokes a sense of movement, making the evening a perfect backdrop for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. The marine layer lingers gently, though the fog remains elusive, hinting at the brief brightness expected tomorrow.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Wednesday, expect the sun to cautiously unveil its presence, casting a soft glow during a partly sunny day. Highs may reach near 64, though a fresh breeze will usher in a subtle temperature drop by afternoon. In this pleasant climate, one might find comfort in layers; a light sweater accompanied by a windbreaker will suffice as the city comes alive with activity. Consider exploring the hidden treasures of the city\u2014perhaps a quiet caf\u00e9 or a bookshop nestled in the corners of the bustling streets, where you can savor a moment of calm.",
