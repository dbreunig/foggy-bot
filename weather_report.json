    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a radiant sun, casting a gentle warmth across the cityscape. The air is crisp and cool, with a slight whisper of breeze heralding the day. As the sun climbs higher, it illuminates the already clear skies, creating an inviting atmosphere perfect for a casual stroll or leisurely coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9. The temperature hovers around a mild 62 degrees, befitting a day that promises comfort rather than heat. \n\nHowever, as night approaches, a hint of mystique emerges; patchy fog will creep in, cloaking the city in veils of gray, particularly after the clock strikes 4 AM. This marine layer offers a beautiful contrast to the day's clarity, painting the skyline with an eerie yet enchanting quality. For the time being, a light jacket will suffice against the cool air, but as evening settles, be prepared to wrap up a bit tighter as the temperature dips towards 50. The day beckons to explore the back streets and hidden gardens of San Francisco, inviting you to embrace its unique charm in the full embrace of sunlight before a mysterious fog weaves its tales into the night.",
