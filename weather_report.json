    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, the atmosphere is one of gentle clarity, with mostly clear skies casting a serene veil over the city. As night envelops the landscape, temperatures nudge toward the low 49s, while a mild westerly breeze weaves through the streets, stirring the air and carrying a hint of salt from the bay. Those venturing outside might find a light jacket comforting against the playful gusts, which dance at times with an exuberance that hints at the exhilaration of spring.\n\nTomorrow unfolds with promise; a sun-drenched day awaits as the sun rises to greet the skyline. Anticipate temperatures climbing to around 65 degrees, harmonizing beautifully with the west-northwest wind that shall encourage leisurely strolls and inviting adventures. The absence of fog and the absence of the marine layer mean the Golden Gate and the hills will stand proudly against the backdrop of a vibrant blue sky. Morning walkers, caf\u00e9 dwellers, and park enthusiasts will find the conditions inviting for simple pleasures, whether it be a quiet moment with a book in the park or a leisurely exploration of the city\u2019s vibrant streets, basking in the joys of an unblemished day.",
