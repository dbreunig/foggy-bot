    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Downtown San Francisco, the evening air carries a light softness, accented by the gentle caress of a west-southwest breeze. The sun has dipped behind the horizon, leaving behind the remnants of a bright afternoon that brought a pleasant warmth, now yielding to a mild embrace as temperatures rest around a comfortable 54 degrees. The horizon glimmers with scattered clouds, hinting at a night that feels neither oppressive nor chilly, but rather a refreshing reprieve from the day\u2019s sun-drenched splendor.\n\nWhile the afternoon showcased the city in clear skies and vibrant colors, a maritime influence cloaks the far reaches of the bay. Wisps of fog linger close to the Golden Gate, reminiscent of soft cotton candy, conjuring a sense of mystery and nostalgia. Tonight's forecast suggests a continuation of these mostly cloudy conditions, but the marine layer is not an unwelcome visitor; instead, it ushers a serene ambiance perfect for simple pleasures. Consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a twilight coffee at a quiet caf\u00e9, where the day's warmth lingers just enough to keep the chill at bay. Dress warmly, perhaps in layers, as the cool breeze may kiss your skin with the promise of a classic San Francisco evening.",
