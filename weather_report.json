    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a gentle embrace from partly cloudy skies under which the temperature hovers around a mild 51 degrees. A soft breeze from the south-southwest whispers through the streets at about six miles per hour, adding a refreshing touch to the early morning stillness. With the sun poised to rise, a shift will occur; the day promises warmth, with sunny spells reaching as high as 63 before a gradual decline back towards the cool comfort of the afternoon.\n\nDespite the promise of sunshine, a delicate marine layer lingers just off the coastline, marking the boundary where land meets the sea. This ethereal fog, often a hallmark of San Francisco\u2019s charm, might still be visible in the air, softening the outlines of iconic structures while offering a glimpse of the city\u2019s layered beauty. Dress in layers for the day ahead; a light sweater or jacket will serve well for the cooler morning and a comfortable afternoon outfit for the sunshine that will break through later. Ideal activities may include a leisurely walk along the waterfront, indulging in the revitalizing energy of the bay, or perhaps finding a quiet corner in your favorite caf\u00e9 \u2013 a perfect spot to savor a cup of warm coffee while the day unfolds around you.",
