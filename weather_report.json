    "weather_report": "This morning greets Downtown San Francisco with a tranquil, sunlit clarity, hinting at a pleasant summer day ahead. The high will hover around a comfortable 64 degrees, gradually settling to around 62 as the afternoon unfolds. A brisk west-southwest wind dances through the city, lending a gentle vivacity to the atmosphere, with gusts that may occasionally stir the leaves and ruffle clothing as you stroll along the streets. \n\nAs the sun bathes the skyline, it\u2019s the early hours that best showcase the lack of fog; the marine layer is distant, retreating to grant the city its moment with clear skies. This invites a delightful chance to step outside, perhaps to linger in a local caf\u00e9 or wander through one of the city's verdant parks, feeling that fresh breeze caress your face. Dress in layers for comfort\u2014a light sweater beneath a comfortable shirt might serve you well for the cooler afternoon. With this refreshing weather, consider setting off for a leisurely walk along the waterfront, savoring the beauty of the Bay and the gentle sounds of the city waking to a warm summer day.",
