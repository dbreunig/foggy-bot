    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun bathes the city in a vibrant glow, despite a gentle west wind carrying a crispness that reminds us of the ocean\u2019s proximity. As the temperature hovers gracefully around 65 degrees, a slight chill settles in with the forecast suggesting a cooling trend as the hours pass. The skies exhibit a cheerful clarity, devoid of fog or the usual marine layer that often veils the Golden Gate and city skyline. This is a rare treat, an invitation to embrace the outdoors and wander freely under an azure canvas.\n\nAs evening approaches, the charm persists with partly cloudy skies promising a tranquil night cap at a comfortable 52 degrees. Those venturing out may wish to don light layers, perhaps a favor for a cozy sweater or a jacket that shields against the west wind, particularly as gusts may surprise with a playful tug. Consider an early evening stroll through the Mission District, where murals tell stories and cafes offer warmth in both atmosphere and beverage. Alternatively, one might enjoy the fresh air from a rooftop perch, savoring a moment of stillness while the city breathes deep in the fading light.",
