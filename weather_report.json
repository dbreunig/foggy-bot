    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a sunny sky, a refreshing respite as the day reaches a comfortable peak around the low sixties. A mild west-southwest breeze stirs the air with the promise of warmth, though the hint of briskness reminds you that layers are a trusted companion in this ever-changing coastal climate. The light is clear, bathing the city in a soft glow, yet the outlines of the distant hills remind us of the fog that can often loom, whispering tales of the marine layer just beyond sight.\n\nAs evening approaches, the atmosphere will shift gently, bringing with it the cool embrace of partly cloudy skies. Temperatures will dip into the low fifties, and a light south-southwest wind will caress the streets, making a light jacket or sweater a wise choice for those venturing out. The dusk invites leisurely strolls through vibrant neighborhoods, perhaps a stop for a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 or a quiet moment under the twinkling city lights. The day\u2019s clear expression of sunshine would have made watching the Golden Gate Bridge from the city\u2019s heights a treat, while tonight calls for a more contemplative engagement with the urban landscape.",
