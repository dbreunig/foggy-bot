    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a generous sun, casting its warm embrace over the city as clouds drift lazily in the azure sky. The temperature lingers in the mid-sixties, dipping slightly as the afternoon wanes. A gentle westward breeze, brisk yet invigorating, whispers through the streets, rattling leaves and rustling the light fabric of sundresses and light jackets worn by passersby. The air feels fresh, crisp, and decidedly pleasant, with no foreboding signs of fog or the marine mist that often cloaks the Golden Gate. Instead, the visibility stretches over the bay, revealing the majestic outlines of hills and bridges unshrouded by cloud.\n\nAs evening approaches, a palette of soft hues may grace the horizon, welcoming the cooler air that will settle around 52 degrees tonight. While it will remain partly cloudy, the specter of fog seems to have taken a holiday for the day. For those wishing to relish this delightful weather, a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to one of the vibrant outdoor cafes could provide just the right touch of enchantment. As the sun sets, consider an evening walk through the city parks, where the lingering warmth of the day dissipates into the gentle embrace of dusk. Opt for layers; a light sweater will suffice as the evening cools, perfect for sipping a warm beverage while contemplating the shimmering reflections in the bay.",
