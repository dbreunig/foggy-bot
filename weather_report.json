    "weather_report": "The city lies peacefully under a veil of clouds as dawn breaks, casting a soft light over downtown San Francisco. The air cools to around 50 degrees, making the night feel intimate and snug, punctuated only by a gentle west wind that whispers through the streets. As the day unfurls, the promise of sunshine grows, with temperatures edging toward a crisp 60. Come midday, expect a lively breeze, bringing with it a sense of vigor, its gusts playfully engaging with the lengthening shadows of the city\u2019s architecture.\n\nFor those venturing outside, layering is key\u2014think a light jacket and a comfortable long-sleeve shirt, perfect for both the lingering chill of the morning and the warmth that will emerge as the sun climbs. The marine layer may still linger, hugging the coastal edges and perhaps creeping through the Golden Gate, lending a soft, ethereal quality to the view. Enjoy a leisurely stroll through the neighborhood parks or sip a warm brew at a corner caf\u00e9, letting the day unfold gently, embracing the serene beauty of this oft-misty yet invigorating city.",
