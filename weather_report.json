    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the skies remain moody and mostly cloudy, with a gentle chill weaving through the city. The current temperature nudges around a comfortable 51 degrees, complemented by a westerly breeze that dances through the air with a lightness, occasionally gusting to create a subtle rustle among the leaves. With a 20% chance of precipitation, the night holds an air of anticipation but little certainty for moisture. \n\nAs dawn approaches, Saturday will reveal itself in shades of golden sunlight, promising a pleasant day with a high near 60. The winds will carry a bit more energy, blowing steadily and sometimes gusting lively, stirring thoughts of preparation. Dress in layers to adapt to the shifting warmth and coolness, perhaps donning a light jacket that can keep the evening chill at bay. The clarity of the day should shine through, although fog may weave in and out of the coastal backdrop\u2014a gentle reminder of its presence but unlikely to overwhelm the blue skies overhead. In light of these conditions, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a reflective visit to the gardens of Golden Gate Park, where the dance of sun and cloud lends a picturesque quality to your outing.",
