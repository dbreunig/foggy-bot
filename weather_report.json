    "weather_report": "A gentle morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, where the day welcomes a soothing clarity that promises to lift spirits. The city is mostly sunny, bathed in a soft light that hints at the warmth to come. Temperatures are expected to rise steadily, settling near a comfortable 68 degrees by afternoon. The soft whispers of the west wind, ranging from a subtle 2 to 10 mph, add a refreshing touch, making it an ideal time to venture outdoors.\n\nAs the sun climbs higher, the marine layer lingers softly at the edges of the Golden Gate Bridge, a temporary veil that is gradually drawn back to reveal the iconic silhouette. Tonight, the sky will shift to a partly cloudy blanket, cooling down to about 51 degrees, prompting a cozy wrap-up at day\u2019s end. For those who wish to embrace the day, dressing in layers offers versatility, preparing for the warmth of midday while ensuring comfort as the evening chills set in. Consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a peaceful moment in one of the city\u2019s radiant parks, where the budding greenery mirrors the warmth of the day.",
