    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, a vibrant sun reigns over the city, warming the streets as the temperature hovers around a pleasant 78 degrees. Although there was an initial heat that will sway toward a cooler 73 as the day unfolds, the sun's rays bring a lively glow to the cityscape, with a gentle west wind dancing through the air. Against this backdrop, the clarity of the day remains striking, revealing San Francisco in all its splendor\u2014bridges and hills framed against an azure sky, unmarred by fog or haze.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the evening will embrace us with a comfortable coolness, settling around 59 degrees. A mostly clear night will invite a soothing breeze from the west southwest, creating the perfect ambiance for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet dinner outside. For these conditions, a light jacket or sweater would be wise as the sun dips below the horizon; a lovely cap to a day filled with vibrant city life. Consider venturing to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of coffee or wandering through the streets, allowing the spirit of the city to wrap around you.",
