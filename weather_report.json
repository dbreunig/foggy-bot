    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun bathes Downtown San Francisco in a warming glow, as bright and clear skies stretch across the horizon with hardly a whisper of cloud to disturb them. The cool west wind carries a gentle caress, making the high of 57 feel refreshing rather than chilly. While the temptation to linger outside is buoyed by this inviting clarity, one might notice the edges of the city skirting toward the Pacific, where the ever-present marine layer can\u2019t quite fully retreat, hinting at the ocean\u2019s cool embrace just beyond sight.\n\nAs evening approaches, the forecast promises a shift to a slightly cooler night, with temperatures dipping to 44 and a reassuring clarity lingering. A light breeze will accompany the dusk, making it an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet visit to one of the city\u2019s many charming caf\u00e9s. Layering with a light jacket will be wise, as the air can turn brisk in the shadows, creating an inviting atmosphere for conversations under the stars, framed by the serene backdrop of a bustling city unwinding from its day.",
