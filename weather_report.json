    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of cloud hovers like a soft whisper, promising a slight chance of drizzle just beyond the hour. The air is cool and still, with a hint of a west-southwest wind brushing against the skin, setting the stage for a tranquil night. Under this blanket of clouds, temperatures linger around a comfortable 58 degrees, creating an almost serene ambiance. Looking toward the horizon, one can almost feel the allure of the city\u2019s lights glimmering through the mist, offering a cozy invitation to enjoy the soft evening charm.\n\nBy morning, expect a tantalizing glimpse of the sun as the clouds part slightly, allowing for a day that transitions from a lingering drizzle to moments of radiant brightness. The high will gently ascend to around 68 degrees, embodying a delightful warmth that will settle into the afternoon. As the wind picks up, expect a playful breeze that carries the scent of the bay, nudging one toward casual outdoor pursuits. Layered clothing will serve well today, with light sweaters being a wise choice for the morning chill, giving way to breathable fabrics as the day unfolds. Perhaps a gentle stroll through the waterfront or a leisurely coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 could best embrace the day, allowing the beauty of the city to unfold in splendid quietude.",
