As the afternoon unfolds, the mercury will subtly lower, hinting at the coolness that often bathes the city as the sun makes its descent. The wind, whispering with a west-southwest breath, provides a brisk touch, with gusts accentuating the fresh air\u2014ideal for a refreshing stroll through the bustling streets or along the waterfront. \n\nIn the evening, the clarity remains, turning mostly clear as night falls, drawing back to a comfortable low around 53 degrees, leaving room for those who appreciate the cool night air. The gentle wind, persistent yet soothing, suggests dressing in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket to fend off the evening chill, while still allowing for the freedom of movement during the day. The delightful clarity of the day beckons for a casual outing. Why not explore the vibrant food scene, or perhaps find a cozy caf\u00e9 where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the unmistakable charm of the city? Ending the day with a quiet moment by the bay could provide a perfect conclusion, allowing one to bask in the serene beauty as the sun slips below the horizon.",
