    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the sky gradually shifts into a gentle canvas of partly cloudy shadows, where the whispers of a west wind will carry through at a mild pace. Expect temperatures to dip to a soft low around fifty degrees, inviting an evening that feels crisp yet playful. Tomorrow, as the sun rises and casts its golden glow upon the city, it promises to gift us with mostly sunny skies and a comfortable high near sixty-one, again under the watchful gaze of that persistent west wind.\n\nAs soft hints of fog linger near the Golden Gate, the landscape presents a delicate balance between clarity and the glistening embrace of a marine layer. This combination offers a vision of the city that feels both fresh and invigorating, brimming with the energy of a weekend that beckons exploration. To navigate the evening and tomorrow, a light jacket will serve the purpose well, while layers beneath keep the chill at bay for those who linger outdoors. Opportunities abound: a stroll through the vibrant streets suits the season, with cafes waiting to be discovered, each offering a warm corner to sip on something cozy. Alternatively, a quiet moment in one of the many parks would allow the city\u2019s charm to envelop you, every shadow and warm beam a reminder of the beauty that is uniquely San Francisco.",
