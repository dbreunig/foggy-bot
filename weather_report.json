    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a gentle air, laced with a hint of the Pacific\u2019s cool embrace. A quiet chance of drizzle lingers softly in memory before 11 a.m., a fleeting reminder of the ocean\u2019s presence, yet the day quickly sheds its earlier caution to reveal a tapestry of mostly sunny skies. The temperature nudges close to a comfortable 65 degrees, gradually settling into the soothing warmth of 63 as the afternoon stretches ahead. A fresh west-southwest wind dances through the streets at a lively pace, a blend of breezy comfort accompanying the sun\u2019s presence.\n\nAs the evening approaches, the sky will soften to a partly cloudy canvas, the evening air dropping to a mild 56. Tonight's gentleness invites you outside, perhaps to linger in a local caf\u00e9, surrounded by the vibrant hum of city life. Light layers will serve you well throughout the day; a light jacket or sweater will keep the coolness at bay as the sun begins to dip. With such delightful weather, the afternoon might be best spent wandering along the waterfront, savoring a stroll, or finding a charming spot to read\u2014a perfect pairing for a day kissed by the sun's gentle glow and the lingering whisper of ocean breezes.",
