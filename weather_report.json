With temperatures dipping to a cool 50, a light jacket would serve your comfort well against the mild bite in the air. \n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the sun is slated to rise triumphantly, rendering the day bright and cheerful with a high hovering around 64. The atmosphere will remain unclouded, beckoning the leisurely to immerse themselves in the city\u2019s charms.
