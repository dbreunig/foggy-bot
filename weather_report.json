    "weather_report": "As the night unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, a soothing stillness embraces the city, with a refreshing crispness lingering in the air. Currently, skies are mostly clear, allowing the stars to gleam with an intimate brightness, while the gentle south-southwest breezes dance softly at 2 to 6 mph. With the temperature dipping into the low 50s, a light sweater or a cozy jacket will be just the right companion for those meandering through the streets or enjoying the evening's solitude.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of sunshine beckons with a gentle warmth. Expect a high near 69, though it will gracefully retreat to about 66 by afternoon. The west winds will offer a mild caress, urging residents to step outside and relish the clear skies. It's a perfect day for a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to one of the local art galleries that dot the downtown area. Consider a leisurely coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9 where the sunlight can weave through the trees, casting playful shadows amidst the laughter and conversation. Dress lightly, layering might be wise to navigate the subtle transitions from cool morning air to the warmth of the day.",
