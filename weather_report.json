    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a bright sun, casting a warm glow over the eclectic tapestry of the city's streets. A gentle west wind sends playful whispers through the air, creating a refreshing ambience as the temperature gracefully settles around a comfortable sixty-eight degrees. The day offers a delightful clarity, with blue skies stretching over the horizon, allowing glimpses of distant hills and the shimmering bay. As evening approaches, this pleasant weather is set to give way to a mostly clear night, perfect for a stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment at a nearby caf\u00e9.\n\nWhile the familiar coastal fog tends to retreat during such splendid days, hints of the marine layer may linger off in the distance, ready to reclaim the skyline as night wraps its cool arms around the city. For those venturing out, light layers are advisable; a simple sweater or jacket will suffice as temperatures dip into the lower fifties. This is an ideal evening to engage in low-key activities\u2014perhaps a leisurely walk through the historic streets or meeting with friends for a relaxed dinner outdoors, basking in the gentle winds and the soft light that paints the city in its evening hues.",
