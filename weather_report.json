    "weather_report": "As the city quickly settles into night, the air carries a whisper of moisture, hinting at the brief chance of rain that may pass before dawn breaks over the Bay. Presently, a soft cloud cover blankets the landscape, weaving a delicate shroud around the hills and the expansive waters beyond, where the lights of the Golden Gate flicker like distant stars against the deepening dusk. The humidity wraps around you, an ever-present reminder of San Francisco\u2019s embrace, but the temperature, hovering gently, invites a light jacket.\n\nLooking ahead to the morning, the forecast holds promise of clarity, with patchy fog teasing the edges of visibility before the sun rises. It may reveal a blue sky, framing the cityscape with warmth that is rare yet welcome. With the expected high peaking near 64, afternoon warmth will gradually seep in, coaxing people outdoors. For those planning the day, a thoughtful layering of light fabrics\u2014perhaps a sleeveless top adorned with a casual cardigan\u2014will suffice to navigate through the cool morning and the pleasantly mild afternoon. The day could be best spent meandering through the waterfront or pausing at a cozy caf\u00e9, indulging in literature or lively conversation, as the urban rhythm pulses softly under the sun.",
