    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the remnants of night linger with a cool embrace, the air crisp and mostly clear. The low temperatures hover near a refreshingly brisk 44 degrees, accompanied by gentle breezes whispering from the southwest. But the promise of the day casts a cautious shadow, as clouds gather in the distance, hinting at rain beginning after the clock strikes five. While the morning unfolds under a partly sunny disposition, there\u2019s a sense of inevitability in the gathering moisture; a 60% chance suggests that umbrellas may soon shift from decorative to necessary.\n\nFor those stirring from slumber, the day offers a fine opportunity to don layers\u2014a cozy sweater beneath a light jacket should adequately fend off the early chill. As the hours pass, consider wandering through the streets to enjoy a fresh pastry from a local caf\u00e9 or perhaps visiting a quiet spot to enjoy the city\u2019s iconic views. With the clouds rolling in later, you might find it an ideal time to visit one of the city\u2019s museums or indulge in a leisurely afternoon reading at a cozy bookstore. But be prepared; as twilight approaches, the skies will darken, promising a curtain of rain to close the day.",
