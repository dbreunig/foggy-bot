    "weather_report": "As the sun begins to withdraw, casting a soft glow over Downtown San Francisco, the day\u2019s warmth lingers, later embracing the city with a gentle coolness. This afternoon\u2019s sunshine has revealed a sky mostly clear, yet an air of anticipation hangs, perhaps hinting at the fog creeping from the Pacific, waiting to unfurl its tendrils across the horizon. With winds brushing through at a spirited 15 mph, the atmosphere feels refreshing, a reminder of summer's fleeting nature as it dances through the streets.\n\nTonight, expect a touch of chill, inviting you to don a light sweater or a casual jacket for evening strolls through your neighborhood. With temperatures softening to around 54, it\u2019s a pleasant setting for a leisurely cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or a simple walk along the Embarcadero, where the wisps of fog may begin to weave their spell, softly enveloping the city in a blanket of mystery. The presence of a gentle marine layer adds an intriguing element to your evening, encouraging a sense of exploration amid the ever-enigmatic charm of the City by the Bay.",
