    "weather_report": "As night enfolds Downtown San Francisco, a gentle cloak of clouds drapes across the city, casting a muted shimmer over the bustling streets below. With temperatures settling around a mild 56 degrees, the night feels soft yet invigorating, accented by a modest breeze whispering at about eight miles per hour. The Golden Gate Bridge sits partially shrouded, hinting at an ever-encroaching marine layer, perhaps gently reminding inhabitants of the city's famed fog. \n\nAs Wednesday unfolds, expect the sun to peek through the clouds, offering a slightly brighter disposition with highs near 64 degrees. A faint warmth promises to arise, though the afternoon may drift into cooler temperatures as the clouds linger. Wind gusts could flutter about, adding a dash of playfulness to the day\u2019s atmosphere. Layering becomes essential; a light jacket or cardigan will suffice for those strolling along the waterfront or venturing into the hills. With the conditions as they are, why not take a quiet walk through Golden Gate Park, where the soft rustle of leaves and distant laughter share the air? Alternatively, a brief visit to a local caf\u00e9 could offer the perfect respite, ideal for indulging in warm pastries and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, as the clouds slowly unfold into a brighter day.",
