As evening beckons, temperatures will settle near a comfortable 54 degrees, accompanied by a whispering southwest breeze at around 8 mph. The atmosphere is relatively clear yet hints at an impending marine layer that typically blankets the city in fog\u2014an ever-present character of coastal San Francisco. \n\nLooking toward Wednesday, the day promises a mix of mild moments and a projected chance of light rain after 5 PM, as clouds will dance across the heavens, allowing for brief displays of sunshine among the clouds. With a high nearing 62 degrees and winds gaining strength from the south-southwest at 8 to 14 mph, visitors may feel a touch of the typical brisk air that gives our city its signature coolness. For those choosing evening outings, a light jacket would serve well against the growing chill, as the wind picks up its pace. It\u2019s an ideal time to explore the quieter corners of the city, perhaps winding your way through the softly whispering streets, indulging in an intimate dinner at a local eatery, or simply enjoying the mellow ambiance from a cozy caf\u00e9 window, as daylight fades into night.",
