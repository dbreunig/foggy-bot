    "weather_report": "As the sun slips below the horizon, a blanket of clouds drapes over Downtown San Francisco, setting the stage for a cool evening. Tonight, the sky is mostly overcast, with temperatures gracefully settling around 54 degrees. The gentle southwest breeze, swirling with the whispers of sea air, caresses the streets, providing a chill that invites a light jacket or a cozy sweater. The scene carries that quintessential San Francisco allure, where the fog may yet emerge but has chosen to linger at bay for now, leaving the night still and hushed.\n\nTomorrow promises a refreshing shift, with sunlight breaking through the clouds to reveal a bright, cheerful day. Expect a high of 64, though the warmth will gradually recede to around 62 in the afternoon, complemented by a gentle wind that dances between 7 to 14 mph. The day unfolds like an invitation to explore\u2014imagine strolling along the Embarcadero or savoring a quiet moment in a corner caf\u00e9, enveloped by the charming rhythm of city life. Given the crispness in the air, dressing in layers would be wise; a breezy shirt or light blouse topped with a soft cardigan will allow for comfort as the city breathes life anew. As the day wears on, perhaps a leisurely walk across the Golden Gate, or simply reveling in a quiet book on a sunlit bench, sounds perfectly suited to the splendid weather ahead.",
