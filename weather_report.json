    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun bathes the city in a warm golden light, casting long shadows and illuminating the architecture in soft hues. The high temperature is expected to be a comfortable 66 degrees, with a gentle breeze coming from the west-southwest that makes the air feel refreshing. While the day starts bright and clear, hints of clouds begin to gather as you move into the later hours, softly curling their fingers around the skyline. As evening approaches, expect clouds to thicken, leading to a more subdued atmosphere with a low dipping to around 51 degrees. \n\nAs you prepare for this transition, dressing in layers will be crucial; a light jacket will serve you well as the warmth of the sun gives way to the coolness of the evening. The marine layer may linger above the bay, hinting at the coastal fog that often graces this city, though at present, visibility remains generally favorable. This is an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or through the quiet streets of the Mission, allowing you to soak in the energy of the day and the gradual shift toward night, perhaps stopping at a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, as you observe the city weaving itself into its evening attire.",
