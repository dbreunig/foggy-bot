    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle blanket of clouds drapes over the city, painting a scene both subdued and serene. The current conditions hint at the lingering presence of the coastal marine layer, lending an atmospheric haze that softens the edges of the iconic skyline. Temperatures hold steady in the mild embrace of the low 60s, an invitation for a light cardigan or a stylish jacket as a companion for your morning stroll. \n\nAs we lean toward afternoon, expect a gradual unveiling of sunshine that will try its hand at lifting the spirits, reaching a peak that hovers near 65 degrees. A moderate breeze from the west will rustle the trees and carry the hint of salt air, creating a refreshing backdrop for an afternoon excursion. It's a day that beckons you to explore the local coffee shops, perhaps to savor the aroma of freshly brewed coffee while people-watching, or to wander through the vibrant streets, enjoying odd pop-up art installations that often surprise. While the morning may feel cozy and slightly overcast, the promise of sunny moments awaits later, a reminder that in this vibrant city, clarity often follows the clouds.",
