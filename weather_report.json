    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this morning, the gentle embrace of a partly sunny day holds a delightful promise. The sky showcases a subtle play of soft clouds, allowing bursts of sunlight to dance upon the city\u2019s iconic structures. The air carries a crispness typical of late February, with temperatures expected to shift gradually from a warm 71 to a cooler 66 as the afternoon unfolds. While there is a whisper of a breeze from the north, it adds a refreshing touch rather than a chill, ensuring the day remains comfortably inviting.\n\nAs evening descends, the city will transition to a partly cloudy night, offering a mild low of around 52, perfect for a light jacket or sweater as you stroll through the urban tapestry. With such clearness, the fog of the previous days seems to have receded, allowing glimpses of the Golden Gate\u2019s grandeur and the full sweep of the Bay. One might find joy in simply walking the neighborhood, perhaps revisiting that little caf\u00e9 that serves the best cappuccino or exploring a new gallery that has just opened its doors. If you're inclined to linger outdoors, a quiet seat at a nearby park, watching the city\u2019s rhythm as day turns to night, promises a serene conclusion to the day\u2019s adventures.",
