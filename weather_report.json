    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, a delicate interplay of cloud and clarity defines the early hours. As twilight fades into a gentle morning, a hint of coastal chill hovers around, with temperatures settling around 50 degrees. The west-southwest winds whisper softly, foreshadowing a day that promises to unfurl like a well-crafted story. As the sun rises, the forecast awakens with it, lifting the veil of clouds to reveal a mostly sunny afternoon marked by a high nearing 58 degrees.\n\nThe city, often graced by the embrace of a foggy marine layer, appears to hold it at bay for now, allowing for expansive views devoid of the usual mist. It's a pleasant scene, ripe for exploration\u2014ideal for strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9 where the ambiance complements the lightness of the day. Consider donning layers; a light jacket will suffice against the briskness of morning and evening, while a simple sweater can see you through the afternoon warmth. Choosing to linger in the heart of the city will reward you with bright corners and charming streets, perfect for savoring the flavors of springtime San Francisco.",
