    "weather_report": "A gentle breeze stirs through Downtown San Francisco tonight, as the city basks in a mostly clear sky, the stars beginning to wink through the darkening expanse. With a soft whisper of the west southwest wind, one feels the city's familiar embrace, the temperature hovering comfortably around 54. The evening unfolds with a calm that invites leisurely strolls along the waterfront, where the faint scent of salt and the sound of distant waves provide a tranquil backdrop to the city\u2019s illuminated horizon.\n\nAs dawn approaches, Tuesday promises a sunlit respite, bright and inviting, with the day set to reach a pleasant 65. The winds will dance playfully through the streets, encouraging casual outings and spontaneous gatherings. While fog may linger close to the shores, obscuring the coastal outlines, the urban panorama offers clarity and warmth. Dress comfortably, perhaps in a light sweater, suitable for the morning chill yet versatile enough to shed as the sun rises higher in the sky. Consider a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for an early coffee, or perhaps a stroll through the parks that stand as green oases amidst the urban sprawl. Allow yourself to savor the simple moments, taking pleasure in the beauty of an invigorating San Francisco day.",
