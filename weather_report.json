    "weather_report": "As the twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle breeze whispers through the streets, promising clarity after the day\u2019s remnants of fog. Tonight\u2019s sky is mostly clear, inviting stargazers and dreamers alike. The temperature dips to a cool 46 degrees, and the northwest wind carries a brisk chill, a reminder that San Francisco nights tend to linger like a soft embrace. The gusts, at times, dance through the alleys and squares, offering a slight thrill amidst the calm, though bundled layers are essential for comfort.\n\nLooking toward tomorrow, a sunny disposition will greet the city. As dawn breaks, expect the warmth of the sun to weave through the streets, commanding attention as it rises near 59 before settling back into the cool of the afternoon. The expected breezy conditions continue, suggesting that even on a bright day, one might benefit from a light jacket or a snug sweater. While the iconic fog may temporarily recede, it's likely to linger just off the coast, crafting a picturesque backdrop for a city eager to embrace the sun. Given these conditions, a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 could provide a rejuvenating escape, allowing one to bask in the splendor of a day that promises both clarity and charm.",
