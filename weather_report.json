    "weather_report": "In the hushed hours of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco is swathed in a cloak of cloudiness, with the whisper of rain lingering in the air. The temperature hovers around a cool 52, making this an evening where layers will serve you well. If you venture out, consider a light jacket to ward off the chill and perhaps a scarf, as the southeast winds tease with gentle gusts. As dawn approaches, the clouds will likely thicken, and those scattered drops may coalesce into a steady rain by afternoon.\n\nWith a 100% chance of precipitation looming over the day, broader skies promise a darker canvas as rain begins its march after 2 p.m. Beneath this muted cover, the city reveals itself through mystical views, but the clarity is diminished\u2014fogs may rise gently along the shoreline, blending with the water in a ballet of muted tones and echoing all that is quintessentially San Francisco. \n\nAs rainwater pitter-patters down, perhaps a warm drink from a local caf\u00e9 will beckon, offering solace before facing the dampness outside. An afternoon stroll through the city's many nooks, umbrella in hand, could also unveil the charm of the streets cloaked in a soft drizzle. Savvy walkers may seek the company of bookstores or art galleries, where the world feels intimate and inviting. All in all, today asks for awareness of the moisture in the air and the serene beauty of a city cloaked in clouds.",
