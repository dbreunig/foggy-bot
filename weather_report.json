    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, this afternoon unveils a splendid scene bathed in sunshine, the kind of day that beckons you to wander. The temperature hovers around a comfortable 66 degrees, hinting at a pleasant warmth, with just enough of a cool breeze wafting from the west-southwest to tease the edges of your light jacket. As you gaze out, the clarity of the day shines through, unmarred by fog or haze, allowing the iconic Golden Gate Bridge to gracefully command the horizon. The only clouds\u2014soft and scattered\u2014drift languidly, affirming that today is a moment meant for appreciation, not haste.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the sky is expected to don a shroud of mostly cloudy attire, cooling down to 56 degrees, urging those wrapped in long sleeves to keep them close. A casual stroll through the city's inviting neighborhoods could be a perfect plan; perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to enjoy a warm drink or simply the indulgence of a quiet park where you can soak in the vibrant atmosphere. With the serenity of early evening on the horizon, your attire should comfortably layer\u2014an embrace of options to ensure you\u2019re ready for the cool embrace that follows this sunlit interlude.",
