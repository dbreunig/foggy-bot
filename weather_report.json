    "weather_report": "The morning sun rises gently over Downtown San Francisco, promising a pleasant day ahead. At this hour, the city wears a serene facade, with a mostly clear sky breaking through a thin veil \u2014 remnants of the nocturnal marine layer lingering in the distance, hinting at its gradual retreat. The high will hover just around 66 degrees, and a slight wayward drizzle may flirt with the horizon later tonight, though for now, the atmosphere delights in the warmth of its golden embrace, with a gentle southwest wind rustling through the streets.\n\nAs midday approaches, dress comfortably in layers; a light jacket will serve well against the fleeting breeze that embraces the city, especially as afternoon transitions into evening. A stroll along the waterfront can provide moments of tranquility and reflection, while a visit to one of the many local caf\u00e9s invites opportunities for fleeting conversations with familiar faces or perhaps a moment to get lost in a book. The clarity of today\u2019s weather is a breath of fresh air, offering a canvas for the vibrant life teeming in San Francisco, where each street corner offers a new scene to explore.",
