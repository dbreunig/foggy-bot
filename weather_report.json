    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a gracious sun, painting the day with warmth as temperatures touch their peak around 67. A gentle west wind stirs, whispering through the streets and offering a refreshing caress while the warmth slowly dips to 65. As twilight approaches, the sky hints at a possible arrival of a slight drizzle after nightfall, cloaking the city in a veil of clouds, while a low of 58 sets in, accompanied by a mellow breeze.\n\nThis evening, the hue of the streets transitions, as the vibrant life of the day gives way to shimmers of city lights against a backdrop of largely gray clouds. The expected marine layer appears to be draping the horizon subtly, whispering of the ocean just beyond, without fully embracing the city this time. An evening stroll seems inviting, perhaps along the Embarcadero, where the soft sounds of water lapping against the dock marry the light breeze. Layered clothing is a sensible choice; a light sweater or jacket will keep you comfortable as the temperatures drop, ensuring you're ready for both the evening chill and any hint of drizzle that might arrive. Such weather invites contemplation, a chance to savor the transition from day to evening in this beautiful urban landscape.",
