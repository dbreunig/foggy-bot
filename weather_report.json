    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco draws near, though a calm serenity envelops the city. The sky wears a pale blue hue, gently illuminated by the sun, offering a glimpse of the day\u2019s warmth as temperatures hover close to 65 degrees. Yet, with a whisper of wind, the air feels cool, and one might notice the faintest hint of marine layer creeping in, particularly around the ocean's edge, giving the iconic Golden Gate Bridge its ethereal presence, partially cloaked in soft mist.\n\nAs evening approaches, the scene will shift to a more subdued palette. A gentle curtain of clouds will drape the horizon, settling to a low of around 55 degrees, encouraging cozy layers. The West Southwest wind will likely stir slightly, providing just enough movement to keep the coastal chill at bay. Today is one of those rare days that invite a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, where one can savor a warm drink while watching the clouds collect over the bay. It's a moment best enjoyed with a light cardigan or a favorite scarf, perfect for embracing the tranquil ambiance of the setting sun.",
