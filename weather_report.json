    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a soft drizzle lightly kisses the pavement, the air tinged with the familiar coastal chill. The clouds blanket the city like a gentle shawl, ushering in a low temperature around fifty-eight degrees, while a westerly breeze whispers through the streets. With a mere twenty percent chance of steady precipitation, the atmosphere feels both damp and delicate. \n\nAs dawn breaks on Thursday, expect the drizzle to wane, greeted by patches of sunshine slicing through the overcast sky. The temperature will peak near sixty-six, before dipping ever so slightly in the afternoon. Wind gusts will dance about, sending sway to the treetops, making a light jacket or cardigan a prudent choice for morning wanderers. The day offers an inviting aura for simple excursions: perhaps a leisurely stroll through the vibrant Mission district, where the scent of fresh coffee mingles with the rainbow murals, or a quiet moment in one of the serene parks, where the sounds of rustling leaves and distant laughter create a gentle symphony. A day like this calls for opportunities to absorb the spirit of the city, even if shrouded in a hint of mystery and untold stories hidden in the mist.",
