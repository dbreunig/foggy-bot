    "weather_report": "In the early hours of the morning, Downtown San Francisco finds itself cloaked in the unmistakable chill of impending rain. The skies are begrudgingly cloudy, a thick cover that hints at the moisture soon to fall. Temperatures hover near the low fifties, stirred by a gentle west-southwest wind that, while brisk, does little to alleviate the dampness. With a 60% chance of precipitation forecasted, one can expect intermittent rain throughout the early hours, likely transforming into more robust showers and thunderous grumbles by midday. \n\nAs the day unfolds, a tapestry of gray will dominate the sky, with a high that barely reaches the mid-fifties. It may not be the sun-drenched extravagance that some long for; rather, it beckons you to turn inward and seek solace from the elements. The drumming of raindrops invites you to wrap yourself in layers\u2014perhaps a snug sweater beneath a waterproof jacket\u2014and stroll through the quieter streets, where the scent of damp earth rises with each step. Caf\u00e9s, with the warm glow of their interiors and the comforting aroma of brewed coffee, become a haven as the winds whip around you, painting an undeniably atmospheric scene for a cozy afternoon spent savoring a good book or engaging in light-hearted conversation with a friend.",
