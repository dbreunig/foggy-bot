    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a mostly sunny morning, with a refined blue sky slowly emerging above. Gentle breezes swirl through the air, bringing with them a refreshingly cool atmosphere, ideal for exploration. The day is expected to embrace temperatures hovering in the mid-60s, offering a moderate warmth accompanied by a brisk west-southwest wind that carries hints of the ocean's embrace. While the clouds linger in the periphery, they do little to detract from the day's allure; rather, they enhance the beauty of this coastal enclave, painting a dynamic canvas against the tall silhouettes of the skyline.\n\nAs the afternoon approaches, there may be a subtle shift, where temperatures might dip slightly, yet the day promises a pleasant charm. Dressing in layers is wise; a light jacket or cardigan will serve as a perfect companion for the cooler moments, while a breathable shirt will invite the warmth of the sun. For those looking to immerse themselves in the city's rhythm, a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, coffee in hand, may be just the pastime to savor the views, breathing in the occasional salt-kissed air. As evening whispers its arrival, the cloud coverage is likely to deepen, hinting at a mellow night ahead, perfect for cozy gatherings or a quiet read by the window.",
