The air feels brisk, a cool whisper of the west-southwest wind that rustles through the tall buildings like a restless spirit. With temperatures wavering around 55, a light jacket or a warm sweater would be a comfort against the cooling night. \n\nTomorrow, the sun will rise with a promise, pushing the clouds aside for a mostly sunny day; yet, as is often the case in this coastal paradise, whispers of morning drizzle could accompany breakfast, before a vibrant high of around 64 emerges in the afternoon. As the day unfolds, layers of clothing will serve well\u2014perhaps a light, breathable top under a cozy outer layer as the winds remain vigorous at 13 to 24 mph. The city, with its eclectic neighborhoods and winding streets, beckons for a leisurely stroll or a meandering visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee melds with the crispness of the air. Today\u2019s unique blend of clarity and marine haze invites exploration rather than retreat, a reminder of the simple pleasures nestled within the urban landscape.",
