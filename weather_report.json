    "weather_report": "As the cool breath of night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a shroud of clouds envelops the city, offering a tranquil cloak against the sharp edges of the evening. The temperature curls down to a comfortable 51 degrees, accompanied by a gentle southwest breeze that stirs the flora along the streets. Dawn will speak in softer tones as the sun rises, promising a dance between clouds and sunshine, with temperatures nudging up to about 60 degrees before gently retreating to the afternoon chill of 58. \n\nToday offers a mix of silver linings, but not much clarity in sight. The fog is likely wrapping around the Golden Gate and along the coastal tendrils, causing a moody backdrop against the city\u2019s famed landmarks. Yet, in this murky interlude, the warmth of a light jacket remains a wise choice, perhaps paired with a scarf to ward off any lingering coolness. As the day unfolds, it beckons one to stroll the streets, discover tucked-away cafes, or embrace the art of simply being present\u2014perhaps finding a cozy corner to watch the world drift by.",
