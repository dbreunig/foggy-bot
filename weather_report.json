    "weather_report": "As dusk begins to settle over Downtown San Francisco, a cool breeze dances through the city's streets, hinting at the approaching changes in the weather. The night sky, a muted canvas of blues, will likely see a gentle embrace of rain after dawn breaks. With temperatures dipping to around 49 degrees, the mild chill invites a cozy layering of attire. Light jackets and perhaps a scarf would serve well to fend off the dampness that promises to arrive with the overnight wind, which will gust with vigor, reaching up to 22 mph.\n\nSunday holds an undeniable promise of rain, the kind that drapes the city in a soft, shimmering veil. The clouds will blanket the sky, embracing the Golden Gate Bridge and the rolling hills in a mystical gray. While the day\u2019s high flirts with 60 degrees, it will feel much cooler with the persistent winds. Expect the sound of raindrops to punctuate the city's rhythm\u2014casting a serene backdrop that encourages quiet discoveries. Perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 or an art gallery could provide solace as the rain falls, creating an idyllic setting for introspection. Wrapped in the gentle embrace of San Francisco\u2019s signature mist, the day might disclose unexpected joys, inviting one to simply pause and drink in the atmosphere.",
