    "weather_report": "As the sun dips below the horizon, a soft blanket of clouds cloaks the city, with remnants of warmth fading into the night. The overnight ambiance lingers gently, with temperatures resting comfortably around 58 degrees. By morning, the light will begin to unfold, revealing mostly sunny skies for the day ahead. Expect the high to rise around 66, but as the afternoon approaches, a slight chill will weave through the air, causing the temperature to drop back to about 64. A moderate southwest breeze will add a fresh vibrance, stirring the day and creating edge-like gusts that dance across the skyline.\n\nWith the cloud cover slowly dissipating, the cityscape will unveil itself more fully as fog plays its ephemeral role along the coast. You may catch some fleeting wisps near the Golden Gate, offering a stark contrast to the glittering city below. This morning\u2019s cool embrace suggests dressing lightly in layers; a light jacket could temper any coolness from the wind, and perhaps a scarf to fend off those early morning chills. Take advantage of the pleasant weather by embarking on a meandering stroll through Golden Gate Park or enjoying a quiet moment at a downtown caf\u00e9, where the world unfolds at a leisurely pace. Embrace the day\u2019s gentle nuances, rooted in a blend of sun and cloud, while savoring the unique charm that continues to define San Francisco.",
