    "weather_report": "This morning in Downtown San Francisco ushers in a serene moment, perfectly captured by a gentle, partly sunny sky. Though a muted sun attempts to peek through, the air carries a cool embrace, with temperatures whispering around the low sixties. As the day progresses, the warmth will yield slightly, settling into the late afternoon chill. A mild southwest breeze dances through the streets, lending an effortless grace to the quiet bustle of the city.\n\nAs evening approaches, the cloud cover will deepen and settle in, draping the city with a soft gray blanket, hinting at a cozy night ahead. The humidity hangs low, potentially hinting at the presence of fog wafting in from the bay, creating a tranquil backdrop to the familiar city skyline. A light jacket or a soft sweater will be your companions today, offering comfort against the crisp evening air. Consider wandering through the quieter corners of the Presidio or perhaps enjoying an intimate coffee in a local caf\u00e9, watching the life of the city unfold under the deepening clouds while wrapped in the style of an easy Sunday morning.",
