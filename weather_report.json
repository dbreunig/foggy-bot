    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a light mist begins to unfurl its subtle tendrils through the city streets, whispering promises of an overnight drizzle. The temperatures hover gently around 59 degrees, with a cool west-southwest wind brushing past, a reminder of the city\u2019s maritime charms. Those venturing out tonight may appreciate a light jacket or sweater, perhaps complemented by an umbrella stowed just in case.\n\nAs dawn approaches on Saturday, the promise of another day emerges, marked by patches of early drizzle giving way to a soft embrace of sunshine. With temperatures set to rise near 67 degrees, and a brisk wind carrying scents from the bay, one might find delight in a leisurely walk along the waterfront or a caf\u00e9 visit, where the buzz of conversation mingles with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. The day holds the allure of exploration under partly cloudy skies, perfect for wandering the trails of Golden Gate Park or soaking in the sights from one of the city\u2019s many viewpoints, as a hint of marine layer dances along the edges of the horizon.",
