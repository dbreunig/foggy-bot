The southwest winds, gentle yet persistent at about 8 mph, infuse a sense of refreshment, hinting at the proximity of the ocean's breath. Though the morning light struggles a bit against the remnants of the marine layer, the skyline begins to emerge, promising the iconic outlines of the city\u2019s landmarks.\n\nAs the day unfolds, a shift is on the horizon; clouds will gather, and as evening approaches, a chance of rain hangs delicately in the balance. With a high near 62, the atmosphere will toggle between partly sunny patches and the hint of impending moisture. Dressing in layers would be wise\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a casual shirt, allowing for comfort as the temperatures fluctuate with the wind's playful nudging. \n\nFor the day ahead, venture to the local caf\u00e9s for a slow morning of indulgent pastries and coffee, or stroll through the waterfront, where the sights and sounds of the bay nurture a thoughtful ease. Perhaps a visit to one of the city\u2019s many galleries could provide a perfect blend of inspiration and shelter from the evolving weather. While a few clouds linger, it's a day to embrace the unique charm of the city, its beauty framed by shifting skies and the soft pulse of life at the water's edge.",
