    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco greets the afternoon with a clear sky, allowing the warm sun to penetrate the city\u2019s iconic landscape, bathing it in a gentle glow. The temperature hovers near 65, while the soft westerly winds dance through the streets, creating a refreshing but invigorating experience. Though the day promises some fluctuation in warmth, it retains an enjoyable vibrancy, ideal for daytime strolls along the Embarcadero or quiet moments in a bustling caf\u00e9.\n\nAs evening approaches, a shift in the atmosphere hints at cloudiness creeping in, ushering in a low around the mid-50s. It may be a good idea to don a light jacket for those ventures outdoors as the marine layer subtly envelops parts of the coast, suggesting a delicate play between sun and shadow. The breeze continues to whisper through the city, inviting one to explore the artistic alleys or perhaps meander towards a cozy bookstore. In this charming blend of warmth and coolness, there\u2019s a unique allure that embodies the essence of a San Francisco summer evening.",
