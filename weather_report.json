    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city greets the day with a bright and cheerful demeanor, reflecting a canopy of clear azure skies. The sun, peeking over the horizon, bathes the streets and buildings in a warm glow, while a gentle west wind whispers through the avenues, lending an invigorating crispness to the air. With temperatures nudging towards the mid-sixties, it\u2019s a perfect day for strolling along the Embarcadero or enjoying a leisurely coffee in one of the sidewalk caf\u00e9s, where the rich aroma of brew mingles with the salty tang of ocean air.\n\nTonight, the serenity of this beautiful day will transform into a still night, the temperature rising slightly to around 57 degrees, making for a pleasant evening under the stars. The northwest winds will carry a hint of coolness, so a light jacket will be a comfortable companion as you wander through the vibrant nightlife or perhaps catch a glimpse of the city illuminated against the night sky. As the fog remains at bay, the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge stands proudly, inviting adventurous spirits to explore the paths less traveled or to simply pause and savor the moment\u2014this is San Francisco at its best, a city that dances between the fog and the sun.",
