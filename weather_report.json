    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth mingles with the brisk embrace of the west-southwest wind, which carries with it whispers of the ocean's edge. The day is bright, with sunlight spilling generously across the city, warming the faces of those meandering through its vibrant streets. There is a hint of coolness as temperatures begin to ease downwards from their peak, creating an amiable atmosphere that invites both wanderers and those seeking solace in a leisurely pace.\n\nWhile the prominent landmarks stand bold and clear against the azure sky, a blanket of fog lingers near the coastline, hinting at the familiar dance between city and sea. The iconic Golden Gate Bridge, always a magnet for both local and visiting eyes, seems untouched yet again by the thick coastal marine layer, allowing for uninterrupted views over the sparkling bay. As the evening draws nearer and the clouds gather in a modest shroud, the temperature will settle, accompanied by a cooling breeze that whispers of restful nights ahead.\n\nIn light of the pleasant weather, a light jacket will serve well against the cool wind for those planning an evening out, perhaps enjoying coffee al fresco at a cozy caf\u00e9 or taking in the vibrant energy of a local art exhibit. For the more adventurous, a stroll along the waterfront promises both charm and serenity, as the sun dips below the horizon.",
