    "weather_report": "As the sun begins to set over Downtown San Francisco, tonight's warmth lingers softly in the air, offering a pleasant calmness after an afternoon bathed in sunshine. Temperatures slowly fall towards the evening\u2019s cool embrace, hovering around a comfortable 59 degrees. You may notice a gentle breeze rustling through the streets, with the remnants of the day's westward winds creating a natural symphony. The sky remains mostly clear, although the telltale signs of the evening marine layer are beginning to creep in along the coastline, casting a quiet anticipation over the Golden Gate.\n\nFor those venturing out, a light jacket or sweater will keep you cozy against the cooler air as dusk settles. It\u2019s a splendid time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the twinkling lights of the city reflect beautifully on the bay\u2019s surface, or perhaps to seek out a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh coffee might provide the perfect companion to the tranquil atmosphere. Enjoy the lingering golden hues of twilight, as the day fades into a peaceful San Francisco night.",
