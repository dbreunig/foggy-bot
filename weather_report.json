    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with the sun peeking through a delicate expanse of mostly clear skies, casting a muted brilliance over the city. The air maintains a crispness typical of early spring, with temperatures hovering around a refreshing 57 degrees, gently tempered by a light west-southwest breeze. As the day meanders on, a slight whisper of impending change emerges with a hint of moisture after 5 AM, though the chance of rain appears to linger in the background, a mere 20% promise of drops on an otherwise tranquil evening.\n\nThe day\u2019s clarity is punctuated by wisps of the marine layer edging closer to the Bay, hinting at its familiar embrace, particularly around the Golden Gate Bridge, where the fog tends to weave its story. Residents reveling in the afternoon sun will find it a pleasant invitation to step outdoors, perhaps taking a stroll along the waterfront or finding a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a warm beverage while watching the world go by. Dressing in layers would be judicious; a light jacket or sweater will serve well come evening as the temperatures dip toward 49 degrees, and should the chance of rain materialize, an umbrella could prove a thoughtful accessory. As twilight approaches and the potential for drizzle arrives, contemplate a leisurely sunset walk, enveloped in the evolving atmosphere of the city\u2014a beautiful denouement to a day that flirts with both warmth and cool promise.",
