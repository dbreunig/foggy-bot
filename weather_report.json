    "weather_report": "As the night deepens in Downtown San Francisco, the city shrouds itself in a soft veil of clouds, the air cool and tranquil, echoing the whispers of a gentle west-southwest breeze. The temperature holds around a comfortable 54 degrees, lending an atmosphere of calm as the urban landscape rests momentarily. In the early hours of tomorrow, a subtle awakening will greet residents, as the sun battles through the morning haze, aiming for a high of 64. This will gradually retreat to about 62 in the afternoon light, a soft warmth fading with the day.\n\nLooking ahead, Friday promises a blend of partly sunny skies interspersed with the occasional teasing of fog clinging to the coastal outlines. Those venturing out might find themselves pleasantly affected by the brisk wind, which can gust up to 20 mph, reminding all to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket to ward off the chill that the sea breeze might carry. With such mercurial conditions, a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely walk through Golden Gate Park could be perfect, allowing the vibrant colors of the day to brighten spirits while keeping an eye on the changing skies. Whether sipping coffee al fresco or simply enjoying the rhythm of the waking city, the attempts of spring to radiate warmth amidst the coastal coolness will surely offer a delightful experience for all who partake.",
