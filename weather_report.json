    "weather_report": "As night begins to shroud Downtown San Francisco, a gentle blanket of clouds now holds sway above the picturesque skyline, with a cool breeze whispering through the pearly streets. Currently, the city rests under a mostly cloudy embrace, the temperature lingering around the refreshing 54 degrees. As the evening progresses, this atmospheric cover may lend a certain mystique to the landmarks, softly obscuring their outlines yet revealing the soft glow of distant lights reflecting off muted layers of fog.\n\nIn the coming hours, the clouds will lift to greet a day of promise. Sunday invites mostly sunny skies, with a high near 65 that will gracefully descend to a comfortable 63 by afternoon, ensuring that the backdrop of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge is clear and inviting. The breeze will dance lightly, with gusts hinting at the essence of a summer's day. It would be wise to don light layers\u2014a cozy sweater or a light jacket that can be shed as the warmth grows. A stroll through the lush expanses of Golden Gate Park or a quiet afternoon coffee in a neighborhood caf\u00e9 would be delightful pursuits as the day unfolds. The fog, though present, speaks to the charm of this city by the bay, a reminder of nature's serene artistry.",
