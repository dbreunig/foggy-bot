    "weather_report": "As the sun begins its descent behind the cloistered clouds of Downtown San Francisco, the day holds a gentle reminder of its dramatic coastal character. Those venturing out this afternoon will find themselves wrapped in a tapestry of mostly cloudy skies, with a chill tracing its fingers through the air. With temperatures inching toward a high of 62, the environment speaks of a day that feels caught between the soft embrace of spring and the lingering whisper of winter. An occasional light rain is expected to grace the city after 5 pm, perhaps compelling the most carefree souls to rethink their plans to linger outdoors too long.\n\nThe low-hanging clouds cast a dampened light, lending a muted palette to the cityscape as fog hovers just off the horizon, softening the edges of iconic landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge. Beneath the cloudy visage, a brisk southwesterly wind hints at the possibility of an evening that could turn a bit wet, with precipitation chances at 40 percent. For those considering a stroll through the streets or perhaps a quiet evening at a caf\u00e9, it would be wise to don a light jacket, comfortable shoes, and perhaps an umbrella, should a sprinkle add a bit of romance to the evening air. Opting for a bookshop retreat or a visit to a local gallery may serve as the perfect antidote to the day's dour yet serene charm.",
