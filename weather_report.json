    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds with a gentle drape of patchy drizzle, a subtle nod to the city's fleeting moods. The air carries a coolness, hovering around the mid-sixties, as thin veils of clouds give way to moments of inviting sunlight. The Golden Gate Bridge stands solemn yet striking in its ethereal embrace, a scene softened by the transient marine layer that clings closely to the edges of the bay. As the afternoon approaches, the temperature gently succumbs to a slight dip, ushering in an anticipative calm, stirring the winds to dance lightly at a steady pace.\n\nAs night falls, the clouds will thicken, bringing back whispers of drizzle as the cool air settles to about fifty-six. Dressed comfortably in layers\u2014as one might wear a light jacket over a cozy sweater\u2014will be most suitable for this evening's escapades. Venture out for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps stopping by a quaint caf\u00e9 to indulge in the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Whether you choose to read by a window or simply gaze at the seasoned charm of the city, there\u2019s an undeniable warmth in the midst of this coastal coolness, offering moments of serene connection to the evening's unfolding narrative.",
