    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, a sultry mist blankets the city, heralding a night of persistent rain that casts an almost ethereal glow on the streets. The temperature is a cool embrace, hovering in the mid-50s, while gusts from the south, spirited at 16 to 23 mph, weave through the empty passages. As the night deepens, the rain whispers a promise of a quarter to half an inch of solace, delicately kissing the earth. The chance of precipitation looms heavily in the air, sitting at 80%, inviting quiet reflection and perhaps a cozy evening indoors. \n\nAs dawn breaks, shadows of clouds linger over the skyline, dark and brooding but utterly captivating. The rain continues its relentless dominance, engulfing the landscape in a moist embrace. The high will barely touch 59, slowly ebbing to the cooler tail of the day. Expect an inch of rain, drumming a relentless beat against the rooftops, merging city sounds into a calming symphony of nature and urbanity. Perhaps today is not meant for the bustling coffee shops or vibrant galleries. Instead, grab a warm jacket before seeking refuge in the nearest bookstore or library, losing yourself in stories and memories. Alternatively, sip on an intricate brew at a caf\u00e9 as the world outside slips into a watercolor of grey, a reminder of the warmth found in life\u2019s little corners.",
