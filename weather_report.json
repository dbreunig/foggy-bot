    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sky greets with a gentle warmth, bathed in unabashed sunlight, casting a radiant glow over the city\u2019s iconic landmarks. The atmospheric clarity, palpable in the absence of fog, allows the Golden Gate Bridge to stand proud and vivid against the backdrop of a brilliant blue, a welcome sight for both locals and visitors alike. As the day drifts towards evening, temperatures slide gracefully into a comfortable coolness, hinting at the serene calm of the approaching night. A soft west wind dances through the streets, whispering promises of a peaceful night to come.\n\nFor those venturing out, a light jacket will be a companion worth embracing as the temperatures settle into the low 40s after sunset. With this delightful weather, consider taking a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps indulging in a warm cup of coffee from a local caf\u00e9, or simply reveling in the tranquility of the waterfront. Daylight may be fading, but the charm of San Francisco is ever-present, inviting you to explore its nooks and crannies as the city prepares for a restful night.",
