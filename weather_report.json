    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the city breathes a collective sigh amid the promise of rain whispering on the horizon. The air, tinged with the coolness typical of spring nights, drapes itself around you like a soft, familiar shawl, with a gentle breeze stirring from the southwest. The cozy enveloping clouds hint at a possibility of light rain before dawn, a 40% chance that feels quite likely, given the soft murmur of the wind. A temperature hovering around 52 invites you to indulge in layers, perhaps a light sweater beneath a waterproof jacket, just in case nature's whimsy unfurls.\n\nAs Friday dawns, the sun is expected to break through the clouds, unveiling a mostly sunny day, yet reminding us of the ever-present coolness that defines this coastal town. While the high nudges toward 59, it will gradually retreat into the mid-50s by afternoon, suggesting a persistent freshness that makes the outdoors inviting yet brisk. On a day like this, take a stroll through the quieter streets of the Mission, enjoy a warm cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9 while the morning light filters through the mingling clouds, or perhaps meander towards the Golden Gate Park, indulging in a few moments of solitude as the world awakens around you. Embrace the pleasant simplicity of an urban spring day, as San Francisco gently pulses with life beneath a comfortably unpredictable sky.",
