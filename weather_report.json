    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unveils itself with a gentle embrace of sunlight, casting away the usual fog that often lingers along the bay. The air is crisp, and though the high will settle near the low sixties, it carries a refreshing lightness that invites urban explorers to delight in the day. As the sun climbs higher, expect a gradual shift from pleasant warmth to a cooler afternoon, perfect for light layering. \n\nTonight, the brightness of the day will yield to a tranquil clarity, with temperatures gently dropping into the forties, a soothing overture to the peaceful hours ahead. Given these conditions, a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet afternoon spent among the vibrant stalls of a local market would harmonize beautifully with your surroundings. A light jacket should suffice as the day winds down into the cool evening, enhancing your enjoyment of a San Francisco sunset that promises an alluring glow atop the city\u2019s iconic skyline.",
