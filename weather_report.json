    "weather_report": "A shroud of clouds drapes over Downtown San Francisco this evening, casting a gentle gray hue that hints at the coolness to come. The low is expected to settle around 50, as a soft west-southwest wind stirs lazily through the streets. Though the skies are mostly cloudy, there\u2019s a thread of optimism in the air; a sense that tomorrow will embrace the sun\u2014expected to rise mostly clear and warm, with a high around 63 that will slip to the lower 60s in the afternoon. \n\nThis evening might feel brisk for those traversing the city, so a light jacket or sweater would serve well against the entering chill. The clouds, though thick, do allow glimpses of the city\u2019s glowing lights, presenting a moody yet inviting backdrop for a leisurely stroll through local caf\u00e9s, or for savoring quiet moments in one of the iconic parks, where the scent of blooming flowers might just pierce through the marine layer. Whether it be a soothing cup of tea or a reflective walk along the waterfront, tonight is a reminder of the tranquil energy that San Francisco embodies as dusk approaches.",
