    "weather_report": "As darkness wraps around Downtown San Francisco, a veil of partial cloudiness softly blankets the evening sky, hinting at the coolness that settles in with a low of about 59 degrees. The gentle southwest breeze stirs just enough to give life to the air, a refreshment against the hint of humidity. The night holds its own quiet charm, with a calmness perfect for strolls through the illuminated streets or simple moments spent within cozy caf\u00e9s, perhaps enjoying a warm beverage while the world drifts into slumber.\n\nTomorrow promises a brighter disposition, with the sun preparing to rise and shine forth with a warm greeting. A high near 77 degrees is anticipated, as the sun will chase away any lingering wisps of fog that often grace the bay. You might find the warmth quite welcome, wrapping yourself in a light jacket for the morning chill, then shedding layers as the day blooms into its full glory. The city beckons with possibilities: a walk along the Embarcadero, an adventure into the vibrant Mission district, or perhaps a leisurely afternoon spent at one of the parks, soaking in the rays. The clarity of the coming day promises to enliven spirits; an invitation to embrace the urban tapestry of life in this beautiful city.",
