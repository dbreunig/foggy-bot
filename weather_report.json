    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco has a brooding grayness, a foggy veil that drapes over the city, as rain hangs in the air like a whisper. The day is likely to be damp and cool, with temperatures slowly retreating from the mid-fifties into even cooler realms as afternoon approaches. Winds blow from the west-southwest, carrying with them the scent of salt and earth, stirring the landscape lightly but unmistakably. The atmosphere feels heavy with the promise of moisture, compelling you to seek shelter or wrap yourself in layers, perhaps a soft woolen sweater beneath a raincoat, to embrace this drizzly embrace.\n\nAs the rain begins to fall more fervently in the evening, the world will take on a reflective quality\u2014puddles forming like small mirrors, capturing fleeting moments of life against a backdrop of muted colors. For those who venture outside, consider a quiet stroll through the rain-kissed streets, where the air is fresh and alive, allowing room for contemplation and solitude. A visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, perhaps, would be delightful\u2014sipping something warm as the raindrops tap gently against the window. All in all, the day invites warmth and stillness, celebrating the beauty of the city in this pleasant contrast of wet and cold.",
