    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfurls with a gentle drizzle, whispering of a day still in transition. Despite the patchiness of the moisture that lingers before heading off, clarity begins to bloom. The sun is making its dutiful ascent, casting a soft light over the cityscape, while temperatures waver between a cozy 65 and 67 degrees\u2014a mild embrace that encourages the lightest of layers. Although the familiar breeze sways gently, setting sails to nearby trees and adding character to the air, the chance of precipitation looms quietly at 20%, suggesting an uncertain but not unwelcomed sprinkle later in the night.\n\nAs the day unfolds, one might dress with a sense of practicality\u2014considering a light jacket that could be cast aside when warmth beckons. The emerging sun hints at picnics in the park or leisurely strolls along the waterfront, where the whispers of waves harmonize with the city\u2019s pulse. The forecast calls for patchy drizzle returning post-11, so an umbrella tucked away might serve as wise precaution should the skies decide to refresh the streets once more. Tonight, the clouds will settle in, offering a calm contrast to the day\u2019s tentative brilliance\u2014a perfect backdrop for quiet reflections while sipping a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9, watching the city's lanterns come alive as dusk falls softly upon the Bay.",
