    "weather_report": "The night unfolds in Downtown San Francisco with rain draping the city in a silvery veil, the soft patter against pavement whispering of a tranquil solitude. Visibility is limited, as clouds gather with foreboding, transforming familiar sights into shadowy silhouettes. The brisk winds sweeping from the south add a restless energy, rustling through the streets, hinting at the moisture-laden atmospherics. With the forecast promising a steady downpour throughout the day, expect the melancholy beauty of a gray sky cradling a chill in the air that hovers around forty-four degrees.\n\nAs dawn unveils itself, the promise of rain continues unabated, a consistent companion for whatever activities your day may hold. While outdoor adventures may feel slightly less inviting, there exists a gentle allure to the indoors\u2014perhaps a warm caf\u00e9 corner offering fragrant coffee, where you can observe the city wrapped in its rain-soaked embrace. Dress in layers: a warm jacket to fend off the brisk air and perhaps a waterproof layer to keep you dry amid the raindrops. There's something soothing in the sound of rain against windowpanes, a perfect backdrop for indulging in a book or sketching the world outside\u2014an intimate experience as the city twinkles with lights through droplets.",
