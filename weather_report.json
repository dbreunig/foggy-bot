    "weather_report": "As dusk begins to settle over Downtown San Francisco, the city stands at the intersection of day and night, wrapped in a blanket of gentle cloud cover. Tonight's weather offers a serene ambiance with temperatures drifting down to a mild 51 degrees. The west-southwest winds whisper through the streets, a soft rustle brushing against the edges of buildings, providing just enough of a cool touch to remind one that summer evenings here still retain a hint of chill. \n\nLooking toward tomorrow, a promise crafted in sunshine lingers on the horizon. Sunday will bring clearer skies\u2014mostly sunny and inviting, with a high that flirts with 62 degrees before retreating gracefully into the afternoon chill. The wind will dance again, coaxing the trees and encouraging local caf\u00e9s to set a few more tables outside. For those venturing out, a light jacket will serve well, perhaps layered over a simple tee, accommodating both the lingering coolness of the evening and the warmth sure to follow. Consider taking a stroll along the waterfront, where the city lights shimmer on the bay or perhaps exploring a quiet caf\u00e9 to savor a warm cup of coffee while gently watching the world swirl past. Such simple pleasures are made even better by the promise of a bright afternoon and a clean breath of fresh sea air, a perfect way to embrace the beauty of a San Francisco weekend.",
