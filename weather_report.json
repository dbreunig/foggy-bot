    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, the evening air is crisp and refreshingly clear, a gentle contrast to the swirl of urban energy. Currently, the temperature sits comfortably in the low fifties, accompanied by a playful west wind that tugs at clothes and carries whispers of the sea. Though the night sky stretches vast and deep above, the familiar specter of fog is notably absent, allowing the stars a chance to twinkle their quiet approval. \n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, residents can expect a sun-soaked panorama, with the day calling for warmth that peaks near sixty-six degrees before dipping back to a friendlier sixty-four in the afternoon. As the light unfolds, the breeze will remain a constant companion, caressing the skin pleasantly, with gusts that might ruffle an unsuspecting hat. For those contemplating what to wear, a light jacket or sweater will bridge the gap between the cool breeze and the sun's affectionate rays, footwear comfortable enough to traverse the bustling streets is ideal.\n\nThe day ahead is ripe with possibilities\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll through one of San Francisco's vibrant neighborhoods, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the day's anticipation. Alternatively, a visit to an outdoor caf\u00e9 to soak in the sunny atmosphere might beckon. Whether mingling with locals or simply absorbing the city\u2019s pulse, the weather promises an invigorating backdrop to any ordinary day.",
