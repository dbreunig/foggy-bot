    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the dawn breaks with a gentle coolness, the air tinged with the promise of a balmy day ahead. As sunlight gradually pierces through the thin veil of clouds above, a low layer of fog clings to the coastal edges, particularly near the Golden Gate, softening the boundaries between city and sea. The atmosphere carries a hint of salt, and though the temperature whispers only of mildness, a brisk breeze is beginning to stir, inviting passersby to throw on a light jacket or cardigan.\n\nBy midday, the clouds will dissolve completely, leaving only a cerulean expanse above as the sun hangs high, painting the landscape in hues of gold and soft green. Temperatures will hover comfortably, making it a splendid opportunity for a leisurely walk along the waterfront or a coffee stop in one of the city\u2019s charming cafes, where the clinking of cups harmonizes with the distant sound of waves. The day promises an ideal mix of warmth and coolness\u2014a gentle reminder of the city's unique climate\u2014perfect for errands or quiet moments spent outdoors, soaking in the beauty of this vibrant locale.",
