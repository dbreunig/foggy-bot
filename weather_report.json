    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a tranquil clarity settles over the city\u2019s skyline. The air is crisp, with temperatures dipping to a comfortable 51 degrees, cradled by a gentle westward breeze. Although the coastal fog is absent, the winds whistle softly, offering a refreshing touch as they swirl through the streets, lifting the spirits of those fortunate enough to be out under the stars. \n\nAs morning approaches, expect the sun to break free, illuminating the day with cheerful brilliance. Temperatures will reach a mild 66 degrees, gradually easing to about 64 in the afternoon. The skies will remain predominantly clear, allowing the warmth of the sun to embrace all who venture outside. It\u2019s the perfect opportunity for a leisurely morning walk along the Embarcadero, sipping a warm coffee, or perhaps exploring the charm of nearby neighborhoods, each displaying their unique character. Dress in layers to enjoy the sun while prepared for the gentle wind that persists in the afternoon. Take a moment to relish the day, for this delightful mix of warmth and breeze invites connection with both the city and oneself.",
