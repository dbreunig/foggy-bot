    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the day reveals itself with a mostly sunny demeanor, a gentle warmth gracing the city with a high nearing 61 degrees. A soft wind from the west-southwest caresses the streets, invigorating the air with a refreshing clarity that makes everything feel a touch more vibrant. While the horizon is painted in hues of blue and gold, hints of a lingering marine layer whisper of a day that may pivot towards coolness as night approaches. \n\nTonight, the clouds will weave a delicate tapestry over the city, darkening into a gentle partly cloudy expanse and inviting a night to settle in with temperatures dipping modestly to around 50 degrees. As the evening creeps closer, those stepping out might find it wise to don a light jacket or sweater \u2014 perfect for strolling along the Embarcadero or enjoying a quiet dinner at one of the charming bistros that line the streets. The weather embraces a feeling of comfort and companionship, urging you towards understated evening adventures that resonate with both joy and tranquility.",
