    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a veil of rain descends as the day unfolds, casting a gray shroud over the city. The sky hangs heavy with clouds, promising a steady drizzle that will linger throughout the day, periodically interrupted by gusty winds that sweep through the streets. The air fills with the crisp, invigorating scent of wet pavement, while the rhythmic patter of rain creates a soothing backdrop to the urban hum. Visibility is limited, and the iconic outlines of city landmarks often struggle to break through the misty embrace. Fog drapes the bay, softening edges and lending an ethereal quality to the Golden Gate Bridge, as if inviting the imagination to wander.\n\nWith temperatures hovering around a cool 56 degrees, today's dress code leans towards warmth and comfort. A waterproof jacket paired with a scarf and sturdy boots would serve well against the weather\u2019s whimsy. For those who wish to embrace the rain, it is an ideal moment to find solace in a quiet caf\u00e9, perhaps tucked away in a cozy neighborhood, where steaming cups of coffee can accompany the gentle sound of rain against the windows. Alternatively, an afternoon at a local museum offers a sheltered retreat to explore art and history, turning a seemingly dreary day into a canvas for inspiration.",
