    "weather_report": "As the lights of Downtown San Francisco flicker into view beneath a blanket of coastal mist, the evening unfolds with a quiet coolness, the temperature settling at a gentle 54 degrees. Tonight, a west-southwest wind, swirling and patient, whispers through the city streets, reminding us of the maritime forces still at play. The clouds linger overhead, creating a moody atmosphere that wraps the skyline in shades of gray, while the gusts tease a sense of restlessness, hinting at the energy of the night air.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the sun will break through, promising a mostly sunny day that gently nudges the temperature towards a pleasant 62 degrees before retreating slightly in the afternoon. The shifting winds will invite anyone to stroll through the neighborhoods, perhaps weaving through the alleys of North Beach or along the Embarcadero where the light catches the gentle ripples of the bay. Given the cool breeze, layers are advisable\u2014a light sweater over a comfortable shirt will suffice as the sun warms the day, contrasting against the remnants of that marine layer which often lingers in the early hours. With the transition from dusk to daylight, tomorrow beckons with the promise of exploration, urging residents and visitors alike to embrace the city\u2019s charm with leisurely walks or perhaps enjoying a quiet caf\u00e9 on a sunlit terrace.",
