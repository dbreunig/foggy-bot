    "weather_report": "As dawn begins to break over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle haze clings to the edges of the city, a delicate reminder of the marine layer that often graces this coastal haven. Clouds twirl above, softening the transitions between night and day, while the air holds a cool embrace, lingering around 55 degrees. The slight chance of drizzle whispers of moisture in the air but promises little disturbance to your morning.\n\nBy midday, the city will yield to clearer skies, as the sun gradually pulls back the curtains of gray to reveal a pleasant and predominantly sunny day. With temperatures nudging towards the low 60s and a west-southwest breeze ruffling the leaves, the ambience invites a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to one of those tucked-away cafes, where the scent of fresh pastries mingles with the salty sea air. Embrace layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket or a cardigan\u2014to accommodate the cool morning and the flirtations of warmth that follow as the sun climbs higher.\n\nThe early hours hold a tranquil beauty; seize the moment to enjoy a quiet book in a sunlit park or engage in the soft murmurings of conversation with a friend. Today urges you to step outside, to linger a little longer under the expansive sky, and to relish the city\u2019s charms as it dances between clouds, sun, and the ever-present promise of charm from its fog-laced history.",
