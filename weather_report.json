    "weather_report": "As the city settles into a dimming twilight, Downtown San Francisco finds itself draped in the subtle embrace of a marine layer, lending a gentle haze to the horizon. Tonight whispers of drizzle may grace the streets after hours, an invitation to relish the quiet of the evening while the low temperature hovers around a mild 50 degrees. The west-southwest wind, a soft breath at around 9 mph, stirs the leaves, creating a tranquil backdrop for those wandering the waterfront or returning home from the day\u2019s labors. Visibility may not be crystal-clear, but there\u2019s a muted charm in the soft enfolding fog, painting familiar scenes in a delicate gray.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the promise of a slightly clearer day emerges as the sun peeks through, signaling a high of near 59. The morning might still carry vestiges of that light drizzle, fading into a more cheerful disposition under brightening skies by noon. A 20% chance of precipitation merely hints at the possible drizzles, as the west-southwest breezes dance playfully through the streets, potentially gusting up to 20 mph. To navigate this fluctuating climate, opt for layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater under a jacket, with the solace of a scarf, should the damp air linger a moment too long. As daybreak brings a sense of renewal, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment in one of the city's many cafes, immersing yourself in the soothing rhythm of life as San Francisco stirs awake.",
