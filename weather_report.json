    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the nighttime sky is draped in a thick layer of clouds, ushering in a cool quiet reminiscent of serene solitude. With temperatures dipping to about 52 degrees, a brisk west wind whispers through the streets, nudging the occasional passerby to wrap themselves a little tighter. The wind, steady at 13 to 17 mph and prone to sudden gusts up to 24 mph, lends a distinct edge to the night, instilling a sense of crispness that challenges the comfort of slumber. \n\nAs dawn unfurls tomorrow, expect a transformation akin to pulling back a velvet curtain. By midday, the clouds will part to reveal mostly sunny skies, though the air will still carry a hint of that invigorating chill. Temperatures will climb, resting comfortably near 61 degrees. The breeze will be a faithful companion, more robust than the night before, with speeds reaching up to 26 mph, adding a lively energy to those venturing outdoors. Dress in layers to accommodate the transitions; a lightweight jacket will serve well against the wind while still allowing the warmth of the sun to seep in as the day unfolds. Consider wandering through the quiet corners of a nearby park or perhaps indulging in a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, as the beauty of the day beckons for simple pleasures and the joy of discovery amid the city\u2019s iconic backdrop.",
