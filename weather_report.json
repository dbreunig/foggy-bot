    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, the skies over Downtown San Francisco are softly cloaked, hinting at the possibility of stray rain showers, especially until the early morning light. With a low temperature cradled around the midway point of fifty, the air carries a gentle chill, inviting one to pull a cozy jacket close. A light breeze whispers from the east-southeast, as the city prepares for the day ahead under the promise of a forthcoming sun.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, expect sunlight to wash away the remnants of the night, heralding a high that flirts with sixty-one degrees. Light clouds may dance through the sky, but their more robust counterparts will hold their distance, allowing for a day basked in clarity. Dress in layers to navigate the temperature's gradual decline as the afternoon approaches. A stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely visit to the Ferry Building would be fitting, while the dining options nearby beckon with warmth and comfort. Today, embrace the city\u2019s invigorating charm, as the sun shapes a vivid tableau of San Francisco life.",
