    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds with a tentative embrace of the sun, a gentle shift from the coolness of night to a promising warmth. Morning clouds are parting, lending a soft, transient quality to the horizon. The air is comfortably cool, hovering around the low fifties, inviting a light jacket or a cozy cardigan for those venturing outdoors. As the sun rises higher, expect a pleasant high of around sixty-five, with afternoon temperatures easing down slightly\u2014a subtle reminder of the Bay\u2019s ever-capricious climate.\n\nWhile the fog may linger just beyond reach, its presence is almost whimsical today; wisps may cling to the distant shores, teasing views of the Golden Gate without fully obscuring them. The marine layer, while less imposing, hints at the coastal breath that characterizes this vibrant city, curling away as the winds, brisk from the southwest, begin to waltz through the streets. This is a day for quiet walks along the Embarcadero or perhaps savoring a leisurely coffee at your favorite caf\u00e9, where the sun\u2019s playful warmth might encourage you to linger a little longer. Dress in layers; the city is known for its unpredictability, and a scarf might just be the perfect companion for your exploration.",
