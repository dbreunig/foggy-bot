    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, cloaked in a gentle embrace of mostly sunny skies, punctuated by the occasional whisper of clouds meandering through the vast expanse above. With temperatures wavering close to a serene 65, there is an inviting crispness to the air, refreshing yet amiable, hinting at the subtle transition to the cooler embrace of the evening. As the daylight gracefully recedes, expect a shift to a more cloistered atmosphere with clouds gathering, nurturing a low dipping to 50, orchestrated by a soft west-southwest breeze brushing past.\n\nThe scene is unblemished by fog\u2014only a fleeting kiss of the marine layer lingers at the horizon, allowing the city's majestic outlines to stand defined, a testament to the clarity of the day. The luminous afternoon calls for light layers, merging comfort with practicality; a sweater may serve well as dusk approaches. Engage in leisurely strolls through the streets, perhaps reviving the quiet corners of the city parks or savoring a quiet moment in a local caf\u00e9 as the dynamics of day and night intertwine. With every fleeting moment, San Francisco reveals itself, a city welcoming the subtle rhythms of everyday life.",
