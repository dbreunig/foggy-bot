    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night descends under a blanket of clouds, whispering hints of a cool breeze. The air is soft and crisp, with temperatures resting around 52 degrees, accompanied by gentle gusts from the west-southwest. As the sun awakens tomorrow, it promises a canvas of mostly sunny skies, inviting the urban dwellers to step into a day that will see highs treading close to 62. A lively wind will dance at varying speeds, creating a playful atmosphere among the city's iconic hills and streets.\n\nWhile the marine layer has yet to fully retreat, a gentle mist may linger on the edges of the bay, adding an ethereal quality to the morning light. The fog, like a delicate veil, wraps around the Golden Gate, a constant reminder of this coastal city's character. For those who venture outdoors, a light jacket would be advisable, keeping one snug against the occasional chill, while layers will allow for comfort as the day unfolds. As you step outside, consider a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh pastries awakens the senses, inviting reflection and spontaneity in equal measure.",
