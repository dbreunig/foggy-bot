    "weather_report": "The sun casts its muted glow across Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, rousing a sense of lingering warmth as the temperature hovers near a gentle 69 degrees. While the southwest wind whispers softly, rustling the leaves while sending the occasional chill your way, there remains a hint of uncertainty in the air. Clouds gather, hinting at rain\u2019s potential return later in the day, though for now, the city basks under mostly sunny skies, albeit with a slight chance of rain lurking after 5 PM.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect the clouds to thicken, ushering in a sharper chill as the temperature dips toward 62 degrees. The ghosts of fog and marine layer may weave in and out, softening the outlines of the skyline and shrouding the beloved Golden Gate in an ethereal mist. For those venturing into the evening, a light jacket will serve well against the cool breeze, while the low chance of rain can be accommodated with a hat or umbrella, just in case. Whether one chooses to wander through the cobbled streets or perhaps find refuge in a quaint caf\u00e9, today\u2019s atmosphere breathes of cozy promise, perfect for quiet contemplation or spirited conversation amid the urban pulse of this enchanting city.",
