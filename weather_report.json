    "weather_report": "As of the early morning hours, a gentle blanket of clouds drapes over Downtown San Francisco, hinting at a tranquil start to the day. With temperatures hovering around a mild fifty degrees, the air feels cool against the skin. The forecast hints at patchy fog lingering briefly, particularly in the northern stretches near the iconic Golden Gate, softening the outlines of landmarks and casting a dreamlike quality over the bay. Midday, however, promises a shift; the clouds will thin cautiously to reveal moments of sunlight that invite a touch of brightness, albeit briefly, before rain creeps into the afternoon\u2014a 40% chance of it, no less.\n\nDressing for such a day calls for layers: perhaps a light sweater beneath a waterproof jacket, preparing for the unpredictable dance of fog and drizzle. The winds from the west will weave through the city, gusty enough to send leaves swirling and pull your hat askew. You might find marvel in a slow stroll along the Embarcadero, where the air carries the salty whisper of the sea, or delight in a quiet caf\u00e9, warm with the aroma of coffee, as you watch the city awaken beneath a shifting sky. Every moment holds the promise of quiet beauty, as the fog mingles with the scent of rain, crafting a uniquely San Francisco experience.",
