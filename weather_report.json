    "weather_report": "As daylight begins to wane in Downtown San Francisco, the skies remain remarkably clear, draping the city in an inviting golden hue. This afternoon brought a delightful warmth, with temperatures comfortably hovering around 78 degrees, later descending to a serene 73 as the day prepares for nightfall. A gentle westerly breeze dances softly through the streets, hinting at the crispness yet to come as evening approaches, whispering of a low around 59. \n\nThe anticipated clearness of the night sky suggests a peaceful evening ahead, unmarred by the usual marine layer that often cloaks the city. Instead, the vast blue overhead is punctuated only by the outlines of distant hills and the occasional glimmer of a ship slicing through the bay. Under these pleasant conditions, one might choose to stroll through the Presidio or linger on one of the many quaint terraces overlooking the water, perhaps with a warm beverage in hand, savoring the romance of the fading daylight before the stars emerge. It's a perfect time for a leisurely dinner al fresco, as the evening coolness settles in softly, inviting a light layer to wrap around one\u2019s shoulders.",
