The air, still and cool, whispers promises of clarity as the sun ascends, coaxing the mist to retreat. By mid-morning, expect a gradual lifting of the fog, revealing a mostly sunny day laced with soft warmth\u2014a high bubbling around 70 degrees yet tempered to a comfortable 67 as the afternoon unfolds. A mild west-southwest wind will swirl through, offering a refreshing dance to those taking to the streets.\n\nFor those stepping out this morning, a light jacket or a layered ensemble will be wise, providing comfort against the lingering chill while allowing for adaptability as the sun graces the city. Consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm brew while watching the city come to life. The enchanting sights of the Bay Bridge juxtaposed against the waking skyline will be a perfect backdrop to a day marked by the gentle shift from fog to sun.",
