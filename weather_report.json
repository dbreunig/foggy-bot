    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, there's a hint of drizzle in the air, lingering from the night, but the skies are gradually clearing, revealing a soft blue overhead. The low tide reveals gentle waves lapping at the shores, and the city awakens under the caress of a cool west wind. With temperatures hovering pleasantly around 56, the air feels crisp yet inviting, the kind that encourages a light jacket or sweater to embrace the day. \n\nAs morning unfolds, the sun will rise higher, coaxing temperatures to a comfortable 66 by midday. The slight chance of lingering morning drizzle will dissipate, giving way to a brilliant blue sky and the invigorating west-southwest winds that dance between 8 to 18 mph, with occasional gusts that provoke the trees into a spirited sway. The marine layer will likely hang low over the bay, softening the edge of the horizon where the Golden Gate Bridge stands sentinel. For those contemplating their morning, perhaps a stroll along Crissy Field or a visit to one of the quaint coffee shops in the Marina would suit this moment, basking in the emerging sunshine with a warm drink in hand.",
