    "weather_report": "A gentle warmth wraps around Downtown San Francisco this morning, ushering in a day where sunshine and blue skies reign supreme. The air is crisp, with the West Southwest breeze rhythmic and alive, offering an occasional whisper of coastal coolness that keeps the promise of summer at bay just enough. As the day unfolds, temperatures are poised to gently embrace a high of 66, before settling into a comfortable 64 in the afternoon\u2014a soft descent mirrored in the fading brilliance of the sun.\n\nThough the horizon is clear and inviting, hints of the city\u2019s elusive fog linger at the edges, a reminder of the marine layer that often dances along the bay. As the sun reaches its zenith, the visibility is splendid, allowing for unobstructed views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the undulating hills beyond. This is a day that encourages long walks; a stroll along the waterfront or through Golden Gate Park would be especially rewarding, with the sun as your companion. Attire should embrace layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater to guard against the ocean's cool breath as dusk approaches. As the evening draws near, the sky will shift to a serene, partly cloudy canvas, the gentle breeze still at play. Cozying up in a quiet caf\u00e9 or settling in at a favorite eatery could be the perfect way to wind down this delightful day.",
