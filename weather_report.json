    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco welcomes you with a gentle embrace of sunny skies, where the high settles around 62, inviting those familiar with the city\u2019s moods to step outside and enjoy the crisp breeze. The winds from the west southwest, playfully at fourteen miles per hour, add a touch of thrill, rustling leaves and combing gently through the hair of anyone venturing out. The afternoon light holds a golden hue, though a gradual descent towards cooler temperatures may prompt you to wear a light sweater or a well-worn denim jacket as you wander through the neighborhoods.\n\nAs the sun softly bows to the evening, expect mostly cloudy skies to sweep over the landscape, dropping temperatures to a cozy 53. The winds will subside slightly, their whispers a comforting backdrop to the quiet of the approaching night. You might find pleasure in the simple act of enjoying a warm cup of tea or coffee at a local cafe, observing the evening unfold as the city takes a breath before the night deepens. A walk along the Embarcadero could offer delightful views of the flickering lights reflecting on the bay, a perfect counterpoint to the lingering daylight of earlier.",
