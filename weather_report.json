    "weather_report": "As the sun hangs low over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle breeze carries the scent of the ocean, weaving through the city\u2019s iconic streets. The forecast suggests mostly sunny skies with a delightful high of around 64 degrees, though the warmth will gently taper to a cool embrace as the afternoon unfurls. Wisps of clouds dance above, while the wind, a playful companion, rustles through the trees at speeds that remind us of the spirit of this vibrant metropolis.\n\nNow, as twilight edges closer, the heavens will grace us with a hint of cloud cover, ushering in a cozy evening with temperatures dropping to a comfortable 56 degrees. With a westward wind continuing its light serenade, it may be wise to don an extra layer\u2014perhaps a light jacket wrapped around shoulders for those leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or in the welcoming glow of local caf\u00e9s. The famous fog, which often paints the Bay, remains at bay for now, rendering the horizon clear and inviting. As day melts into night, this is an opportune moment for an adventurous walk or an evening rendezvous, savoring the essence of the city that never seems to sleep.",
