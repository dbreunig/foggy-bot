    "weather_report": "This evening in Downtown San Francisco unfolds alongside the comforting embrace of evening clouds, hinting at a possibility of light drizzle as midnight approaches. The air feels cool, with a gentle west-southwest breeze weaving through the streets, creating a rhythm that is both invigorating and calming. The low hovering around 57 allows for light layering; a soft cardigan or a light jacket will wrap you well against the night\u2019s chill. \n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, the sun will gradually reclaim its prominence, suggesting a day painted with optimism and gentle warmth, nudging the forecast toward a pleasant high of 66. Expect similar winds, perhaps a little stronger, whispering tales of the nearby ocean. The chance of drizzle lingers lightly in the early morning, fading as the day progresses. Elegant walks along the Embarcadero or a quiet caf\u00e9 visit may provide just the right touch for a Thursday spent in this enchanting city. Dress in layers \u2014 perhaps a light long-sleeve under your jacket to cater to the shifting temperatures as morning clouds yield to brilliant blue skies, painting a canvas for the vibrant activity awaiting in this iconic locale.",
