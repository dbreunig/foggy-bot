    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the weather unfolds with a gentle hand, graced by a tapestry of sun. This afternoon will shine a warm light, with temperatures dancing around a pleasant 63 degrees, yet the chill of the Pacific invites a careful layering\u2014perhaps a light jacket over your chosen ensemble, to ward off the crisp whiff of the west-southwest wind that sweeps through at a leisurely 15 miles per hour. While the moment appears bright, the atmosphere might produce a subtle shift as clouds gather later into the evening; those soft, patchy drizzles may make their entrance after 2 am, like whispers of a secret awaiting discovery.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the horizon will cradle shadows and a low mist, hinting at the potential for fog to weave through the iconic landscapes. While the chance of rain rests comfortably at a modest 20 percent, the wetness in the air might invite you to lose yourself in the embrace of warmth indoors, perhaps with a book and a cup of tea, or a gentle stroll under the lingering city lights, which promise a beautiful tranquility. Embrace this afternoon\u2019s glow and prepare for a night that carries a hint of mystery, revealing the city's charm through a fine veil of moisture and cloud.",
