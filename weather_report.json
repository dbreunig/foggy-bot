    "weather_report": "As dawn paints the skyline of Downtown San Francisco this morning, the air carries a gentle chill beneath the embrace of a mostly sunny sky. The horizon hints at the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge, although traces of fog linger, casting a soft veil over the city, particularly toward the coast. This delicate marine layer adds a touch of mystery, allowing glimpses of brilliance as the sun begins its ascent, promising warmth as the day unfolds.\n\nExpect the temperature to hover around a pleasant 64 degrees, subtly slipping to 62 by afternoon. The southwest wind, brisk and playful, dances through the streets, invigorating the morning air with gusts that can reach up to 21 mph. This calls for layers; a light jacket or a stylish sweater can provide comfort while indulging in the pleasures of the day. With such inviting weather, consider a leisurely stroll through the vibrant streets, perhaps stopping by a local caf\u00e9 for a warm pastry and a moment's respite before embarking on an exploration of the lively waterfront, where the city pulses with life. As twilight approaches, expect clear skies to transition into partly cloudy depths, a gentle reminder of the day's enchantment softly giving way to evening's allure.",
