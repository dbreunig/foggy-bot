    "weather_report": "As twilight settles gently over Downtown San Francisco, a whisper of rain approaches, though its presence feels more like an afterthought than a certainty. The clouds above hang low, enveloping the skyline in a soft embrace of gray that hints at darker moods to come. The temperature teeters around a cool 53 degrees, inviting the evening chill to wrap around you. The winds, mild from the southwest at just a whisper of 6 miles per hour, carry with them the promise of stories yet to unfold in the streets.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the day remains draped in a shroud of clouds, with a fleeting chance of light rain lingering until the late morning. As temperatures hover near 62, they are destined to fall slowly, inviting the warmth of layers\u2014a reminder that even in unpredictable weather, comfort can often be found in snug jackets or even a light scarf. This is not a day for grand adventures; instead, consider a leisurely stroll through the quieter corners of the city, perhaps stopping at a small caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, tucked away as you listen to conversations blend with the gentle patter of rain. The ambiance is one of intimacy and introspection, perfect for enjoying the tender moments that spring rain brings, either alone or in the company of storytelling friends.",
