    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this evening, the atmosphere hangs heavy with the promise of a cooler night, marked by a gentle swell of clouds that wrap the city like a soft, forgotten shawl. As daylight wanes, the temperature settles around a mild 58 degrees, while a mild breeze from the southwest meanders through the streets, whispering secrets of the ocean. There lies a delicate presence of fog in the distance\u2014perhaps a hint of the marine layer drifting closer, eager to envelop the landscape. The city\u2019s silhouette stands proud against the twilight, albeit shrouded by a vagueness, softened like a watercolor painting.\n\nCome Wednesday, clarity shall return, as the sun regains its foothold in the sky, lifting fickle clouds to reveal a golden canvas. Expect a comfortable warmth, cooling gradually to around 64 degrees as the day unfolds, accompanied by a playful wind that punctuates the atmosphere with the spirit of adventure. To navigate the dynamic shifts, dress in layers\u2014a light jacket for the morning's chill, shedding it as the sun claims its dominance. A stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a leisurely visit to a favorite caf\u00e9 would well suit the day\u2014simple pleasures that resonate with the city's heartbeat. If you're inclined, an afternoon excursion to explore local galleries might evoke a sense of wonder; the art reflecting both the vibrancy of San Francisco and the mystique of its ever-changing skyline.",
