    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun casts a warm glow over San Francisco, illuminating the city's iconic structures and inviting a sense of possibility. With the temperature gently easing towards the mid-sixties, the westerly winds, playful and brisk, add a refreshing edge to the atmosphere. The horizon is largely free of fog, with only a hint of the marine layer hugging the distant hills, a reminder of the cool embrace that often follows the warmth of the day. As twilight approaches, the promise of a clear night beckons with the soft glow of the city lights.\n\nIn such splendid weather, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront might be the perfect antidote to the week\u2019s demands. Those venturing outdoors should consider light layers; perhaps a comfortable sweater for the evening breeze and sturdy shoes for wandering. A quaint caf\u00e9 might also serve as a lovely retreat, providing an opportunity to savor a warm drink while soaking in the vibrant energy of the city.",
