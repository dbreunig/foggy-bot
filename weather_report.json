    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a soft veil of mostly cloudy skies, a prelude to the bright promise that Sunday holds. The coastal fog, stubborn yet gentle, embraces the city\u2019s skyline, teasing its iconic landmarks but hinting at a clearer day ahead. As the temperatures hover around the low fiftys, the cool southwest breeze carries a whisper of the ocean, invigorating yet inviting. Those stepping out might want to reach for a light jacket or a comfortable sweater, perfect for layering against the early chill but easily shed as the day warms.\n\nAs noon approaches, expect the transformation to begin. The cloudy demeanor will gradually give way to the sun's golden embrace, with temperatures rising close to sixty-two degrees. In the afternoon, the air feels pleasantly crisp as it settles around sixty, the winds picking up ever so slightly to toss the eager leaves. The charm of this day lies in its subtleties; a stroll through a nearby park or a casual visit to a hidden caf\u00e9 might reveal the beauty of the city in gradual embrace with the sunlight, offering that exquisite moment when fog retreats, revealing the vibrant life beneath. Enjoy this gentle interlude, a Sunday painted with visibility and warmth, straddling the realms of coolness and clarity.",
