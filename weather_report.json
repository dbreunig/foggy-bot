    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the weather unfolds under a mostly clear sky, casting a tranquil ambiance across the city. With a gentle northwest wind joining the cool air, the chill of 46 degrees wraps around like a light shawl, gradually rising to a slightly warmer embrace of 48 as the night deepens. Currently, the horizon is uncluttered, revealing star-studded expanses, leaving any lingering fog from earlier days absent. The typical marine layer, known for its shrouding embrace, remains a distant memory.\n\nAs Thursday dawns, the promise of sun fills the air. The city awakens to a day forecasted to bring warmth, with a high near 61 degrees, though the afternoon may gently pull those temperatures back to a mild 59. A similar northwesterly breeze continues to sweep through, offering a refreshing touch. The clarity of this day invites exploration; a stroll along the waterfront would be complemented by layered clothing\u2014a light jacket or a cozy sweater, perfect for transitioning from the chill of morning to the comfort of noon. With the sun overhead, consider a visit to nearby parks or local cafes where people gather, enjoying simple joys like warm beverages and the vibrant pulse of city life. The day feels pleasantly accessible, beckoning relaxed meanders through the storied streets without the heaviness of fog to slow down the rhythm.",
