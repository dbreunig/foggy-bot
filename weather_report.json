A light southwest breeze whispers through the avenues, accentuating the calmness of the early morning. The sun, however, promises to unfurl its golden hues before long, reaching towards a pleasant 70 degrees. The day will gradually transition, nudging down to about 67 as the afternoon unfolds, with the wind strengthening slightly, bringing refreshing gusts. \n\nThough traces of the marine layer linger\u2014a soft veil that caresses the tops of the hills\u2014the clarity is steadily improving, hinting at the potential for a beautifully vibrant day. The iconic sight of the Golden Gate might still be cloaked in mist, but as the sun ascends, expect those enigmatic foggy patches to recede, unveiling the breathtaking views this city is famous for. For the discerning San Franciscan, a light sweater or a stylish jacket might be the perfect accompaniment for morning strolls or leisurely coffee outings while leaving room for a soft t-shirt or summer attire as the day heats up. With such splendid conditions, a wander along the Embarcadero or a relaxed visit to a local caf\u00e9 to savor a pastry could serve as the ideal way to embrace the charm of this lovely day.",
