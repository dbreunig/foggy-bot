    "weather_report": "As the city sleeps under a mostly cloudy shroud, the air feels mild and whispery, suggesting a low around 55 degrees. The gentle southwest breeze, playful yet persistent, flits through the night, teasing the remnants of fog that cling to the buildings like old memories\u2014if only to remind us of summer's impending warmth. As dawn approaches, the fog may be ready to yield, with the promise of a sunlit day ahead.\n\nCome Thursday, the skies are set to transition to predominantly sunlit realms, hints of blue peeking through the high clouds. Our high will nestle comfortably near 64 degrees, dipping to around 62 as the afternoon unveils itself. With the winds picking up\u2014a spirited chorus from the west-southwest\u2014breezes will dance between 7 and 24 mph, whisking away any lingering coolness. Today offers a serene yet brisk atmosphere, one that invites a sweater layered over a light shirt, perhaps paired with jeans or comfortable slacks for an excursion outdoors. Glistening morning light makes this an exceptional day to wander along the Embarcadero, engaging with the artistry of the city\u2019s architecture or savoring a quiet stroll among the parks. Whether it's a simple coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9 or an exploration of the myriad shops that line the streets, today beckons in an understated yet compelling way.",
