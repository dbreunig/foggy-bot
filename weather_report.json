    "weather_report": "As the clock strikes late into the evening in downtown San Francisco, the air is filled with a faint chill that invites a light sweater or coat. The sky is mostly cloaked in clouds, a reminder that summer in this city can still carry hints of its coastal origins. The winds, brisk and playful from the west southwest, weave through the streets, lending a refreshing quality to the night air. Tomorrow promises a delightful shift, as the sun shall break through the cloud cover, warming the city to a pleasant high around 70. \n\nIn this anticipated golden light, the fog may recede to the fringes, allowing for stunning views of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, quietly asserting its grandeur against the backdrop of a clear sky. With temperatures settling in the comfortable range, it would be a fine day for a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, where one might lose track of time watching the boats bobbing lazily on the bay. Embrace the moment, dress in layers, and let the beauty of a San Francisco day unfold.",
