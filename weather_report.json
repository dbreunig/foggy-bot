The temperatures hover around 63, gracefully falling to 61, creating a pleasant yet crisp atmosphere. The wind, swaying gently at 10 to 15 mph with occasional playful gusts, hints at the character of the city, infusing vibrancy into the air, but also a reminder to dress appropriately for an afternoon wandering the streets or enjoying a caf\u00e9's terrace.\n\nAs the evening approaches, clouds are expected to roll in, bringing with them the possibility of light drizzle\u2014an encounter with nature's subtle touch that blends perfectly with the bustling city life. The mercury will dip to about 56, so layering a light sweater or jacket over your attire will ensure comfort against the cooling night air. While the fog that often caresses this city might be absent right now, it could dawn softly later, cloaking the bay in its signature mystery. For now, the conditions invite pursuits of a leisurely stroll through the historic streets or perhaps a quiet moment in a local bookstore, where the fading light creates an ambiance perfect for an afternoon escape.",
