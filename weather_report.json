A low murmur of thunder rolls in the distance, punctuating the night with an atmosphere thick with anticipation.

The temperature will barely rise, lingering in the cool embrace of the mid-sixties before retreating slightly as the day unfolds into the afternoon. It\u2019s a day best suited for resilient attire; layers will be critical, with a waterproof jacket serving as your steadfast shield against the drizzles and gusts that beckon from the south. A brisk walk along the waterfront while embracing the invigorating scent of wet earth might prove splendid for the soul.
