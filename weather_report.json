    "weather_report": "As the faint glow of dawn brushes over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a canopy of gently parting clouds. The air carries a brisk edge, typical of this coastal haven, while the temperatures linger around a cool 50 degrees. A swift west-southwest breeze stirs the stillness and invites a sense of freshness that can be invigorating. As the sun ascends, it will coax forth a more cheerful visage from the firmament, hinting at a day adorned with mostly sunny skies. By afternoon, the temperature will glide downward slightly, settling in at a comfortable 58, which may tempt you to layer up, particularly if you plan to explore the coastal trails or linger at the waterfront.\n\nWhile the day promises clarity, it casts a subtle nod to the lingering marine layer that often sweeps through, and wisps of fog may cling to the outlying hills, remaining a hallmark of San Francisco's charm. Dressing in light layers will serve you well; a breezy cardigan paired with soft long pants would provide comfort as you navigate both sunlit avenues and the cooler shade of the city's architecture. This is an ideal opportunity to wander through local cafes, perhaps savoring a steaming cup of coffee while the world hums softly around you. Unhurried strolls along the Embarcadero or leisurely reading in one of the west-facing parks would suit these early hours beautifully, capturing the essence of a city that dances gracefully between the fog and sunlight.",
