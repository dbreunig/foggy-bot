    "weather_report": "As morning unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a soft veil of patchy drizzle hangs delicately in the air, adding a muted charm to the cityscape. The clouds, dense enough to obscure the sun's bright intentions, drape the skyline in shades of gray, presenting a tranquil but somewhat moody aesthetic. While the temperature lingers around a mild 58 degrees, it does carry with it the potential for a slight chill, enhanced by the gentle westerly winds that stir solemnly through the streets.\n\nLooking ahead, Thursday promises to bring a touch of clarity, albeit tempered\u2014patchy drizzle may linger until late morning before giving way to tentative rays of sunshine. The high will hover near a comfortable 66 degrees, but expect the afternoon to coax the temperature down a notch, wrapping the day in a cool embrace. While the fog may choose to retreat somewhat, its fingerprints\u2014a subtle marine layer\u2014may linger near the coast, hinting at a restless ocean, eternally at odds with the urban rhythm. In such weather, layered attire is advised\u2014think light sweaters or jackets, easy to shed as the day evolves. Given the atmospheric nuances, an afternoon stroll can reveal the charm beneath the gray, perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 or a leisurely exploration of the quieter streets, where the essence of San Francisco shimmers through the fog.",
