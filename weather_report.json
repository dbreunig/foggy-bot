    "weather_report": "As the hours creep toward the end of the evening, Downtown San Francisco finds itself wrapped in a soft blanket of clouds, with temperatures hovering comfortably around 50 degrees. The gentle west-southwest wind whispers through the city streets, brushing against the faces of those out for an evening stroll. The atmosphere carries a hint of the ocean\u2019s salt and coolness, embracing the unique magic of a city known for its fog yet curiously retaining a certain clarity tonight.\n\nLooking ahead, Sunday promises a metamorphosis, with sunny skies expected to peek through as the day unfolds. The forecast hints at temperatures rising to the low 60s, and as morning gives way to afternoon, a slight dip is anticipated. The southwest breeze will remain a considerate companion, offering a light touch rather than a forceful chill. A light jacket or a cozy sweater will be the right call for those venturing out, ideal for a leisurely brunch at one of the local caf\u00e9s or a stroll along the waterfront, where the Bay\u2019s allure shines brightest. Whether one chooses to explore the city's vibrant art scene or simply enjoy a serene moment in a park, the pleasant conditions are sure to uplift spirits.",
