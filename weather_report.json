Tonight\u2019s low will hover around a comfortable 59 degrees, and a faint whisper of wind from the west-southwest, hardly more than a shy caress, enhances the ambiance. The city stands poised to greet a sunny Tuesday; by daybreak, the warmth of the sun will beckon with a high nearing 78 degrees. Expect a gradual cool-down as the afternoon progresses, where temperatures will sweetly fall to about 72. \n\nThe current visibility hints at a city momentarily unshrouded by fog, a rare gift this time of year. The marine layer, typically a steadfast companion, seems to linger elsewhere, leaving a sparkling blue sky that invites both leisure and adventure. With such pleasing weather, one might don a light jacket or perhaps a cozy cardigan as the evening unfolds\u2014perfect for wandering through one of the city's many parks, enjoying a leisurely stroll or perhaps discovering a quiet corner for reflection among the trees. Perhaps you could sample a new caf\u00e9 with a view, where the warmth of the sun and the gentle evening breeze conspire to create a perfect backdrop for unwinding.",
