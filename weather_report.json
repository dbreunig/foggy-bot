    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle tension brews in the air. The morning begins with a dance of clouds, heavy and brooding, casting a muted light across the city\u2019s iconic landscape. The temperature lingers near the cool embrace of 60 degrees, tempered by a relentless south-southwest wind that stirs at 13 to 23 mph, occasionally sending gusts whipping to 32 mph. As rain looms on the horizon, the atmosphere carries a 30% chance of precipitation until 5 p.m., and the likelihood of a steady downpour increases as evening descends.\n\nTonight, a transformation is promised. By 11 p.m., the clouds will unfurl their moisture, enveloping the city in a brisk, damp embrace. The low will dip to around 52, rising subtly toward 54 as warmth begins its slow invasion of the night. With rain expected and new accumulations in the realm of a quarter inch, the scene calls for warmth and resilience. A well-worn coat, sturdy shoes, and an umbrella will be essential as you venture out into the evening's chill, teeming with the mystique of rain-soaked streets reflecting the city\u2019s lights. Today may not charm with sunshine, but it offers a canvas where the glistening streets tell stories of life and movement, inviting you to discover the San Francisco that thrives under a shroud of clouds.",
