    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun hangs high in a clear, blue sky, promising a comfortable day ahead. The temperature hovers pleasantly around the mid-sixties, inviting a gentle breeze that whispers through the avenues, a reminder of spring's grace. As you look towards the west, the golden glow of the Golden Gate Bridge stands resilient against a backdrop of distant hills, while the marine layer, a soft shroud creeping along the coastline, offers a picturesque contrast. For those out and about, light layers are advisable; a light jacket or cardigan will keep you cozy as the west wind picks up, creating a delightful interplay of warmth and coolness.\n\nAs the evening draws near, expect the air to cool, settling into a refreshing calm with temperatures reaching a crisp fifty-one. The winds will ease slightly, allowing for a tranquil night under the stars. This is a perfect time to stroll along the Embarcadero or find a quiet spot in one of the city's parks, the sights and sounds of the city softly joined by the lapping waves against the shore. In this luminous spring day, every corner of the city invites exploration, making it an ideal moment to venture out, enjoying the beauty that surrounds you.",
