    "weather_report": "As the sun retreats for the evening, Downtown San Francisco is cloaked in a gentle veil of partly cloudy skies. The temperature drifts toward the lower end of the scale, lingering around fifty degrees, while the brisk west wind dances through the streets, carrying with it the chill of the coming night. Tonight\u2019s atmosphere, marked by an invigorating breeze that reaches up to thirty-one miles per hour at its most playful, suggests a renewed appreciation for layers. A light jacket or sweater will accompany any evening outings nicely, guarding against the nip in the air that hints at the lingering marine influence.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, a sunny embrace awaits, brightening the city with the promise of a high around sixty degrees. The wind will continue its spirited role, helping to chase away any stubborn mist that often lingers along the bay. Given the clarity that the day seems poised to offer, it would be a perfect opportunity to stroll through the vibrant streets or explore any tucked-away cafes that beckon you with the warm glow of their interiors. As the sun rises later, perhaps one could indulge in the simple pleasure of an outdoor coffee, accompanied by the distant sounds of a bustling city that never truly sleeps.",
