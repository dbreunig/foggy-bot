    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the night, Downtown San Francisco is wrapped in a blanket of tranquility, the air cool and crisp with a gentle breeze that whispers through the streets. The upcoming day promises to unveil a resplendent canvas of sunshine, as the morning light breaks the dawn and lifts the overhanging shadows of the night. Expect temperatures to rise modestly, reaching a peak around 65 degrees before softening slightly with the afternoon's embrace.\n\nThe horizon reveals a haze of clarity, hinting at the absence of fog\u2014a welcomed respite that allows the city\u2019s iconic silhouette to stand proud under the luminous sky. Dressing in layers is advisable; as the sun warms the day, a light sweater or jacket may be needed in the cooler moments, especially near the bay\u2019s edge where a subtle chill lingers. With such splendid weather on offer, consider taking a leisurely stroll through the vibrant avenues, perhaps stopping for a coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 while savoring the feel of the world awakening around you. Alternatively, a quiet visit to one of the parks could provide a serene escape, inviting you to linger and breathe deeply as the scenery unfolds.",
