    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, today unfolds with a promise of clarity, the sun spilling warmth across the streets, even as a gentle breeze stirs from the west. As the afternoon progresses, temperatures hover around a mild 62 degrees, dipping subtly to a cooler 60\u2014a reminder that even in sunshine, San Francisco holds onto its edge of coolness. The winds whisk through at a lively pace, swirling leaves and teasing light jackets. As shadows stretch and mingle with the sun's embrace, one may spot hints of fog lingering shyly over the bay, suggesting that the marine layer is not entirely absent, yet it largely respects the city\u2019s vibrant skyline.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect a transition to partly cloudy skies, with a comfortingly cool low of around 51 degrees. The air may carry a slightly crisp bite, urging you to layer thoughtfully. A casual stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps to catch the glimmer of the setting sun over the water, would beautifully harmonize with the day's gentle warmth. Alternatively, one could find solace in the city's eclectic caf\u00e9s where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the sounds of evening chatter, making it an ideal spot to unwind in this picturesque setting.",
