The forecast calls for a low of about 52 degrees, with the city\u2019s skyline peeking through a modest veil of clouds. While tonight is partly cloudy, the stars may dance behind their soft shroud, offering fleeting glimpses of celestial beauty. As morning approaches, the sun will unwrap the panorama, revealing a sunny day with a high near 66. The warmth will settle upon the city, though by afternoon, expect a comforting coolness as temperatures gently dip to around 62. The southwest winds promise to add a playful touch, with gusts reaching up to 20 mph, perhaps tousling some hair or sending a light jacket flapping in the breeze.\n\nWith these conditions, it's advisable to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a breathable shirt, perfect for the shadier corners and those hints of chill in the air. Now is the time to take a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the crisp air creates a refreshing backdrop as you sip a warm cup of coffee. Alternatively, the inviting atmosphere of a local caf\u00e9 beckons, promising the simple pleasure of reading or people-watching as the day unfolds. Enjoy the interplay of sun and shadow, and let the vibrant energy of the city invigorate your spirit.",
