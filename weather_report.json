    "weather_report": "This evening in Downtown San Francisco, the sky wears a cloak of soft, gently drifting clouds, the remnants of a day that began with promise. As the sun dips low on the horizon, illuminating the edges of the clouds in muted shades of gold and orange, the temperatures slide comfortably to around fifty-two degrees, inviting a light jacket for those venturing out. A gentle wind brushes through the streets, swirling at ten to sixteen miles per hour, adding a crispness to the already delightful atmosphere.\n\nTomorrow beckons with the allure of sunshine. The forecast paints a picture of vibrant blue skies, radiant and cloudless, as the warmth peaks at approximately sixty-nine degrees before settling into a cooler embrace of sixty-seven by afternoon. Given this welcoming weather, it is an ideal time to saunter along the waterfront or visit one of the city\u2019s many charming parks. A light sweater might serve well for later in the day, when the breeze returns with a spirited dance. Consider finding a cozy caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating, where one can savor a thoughtfully brewed coffee while watching the city bask in its early summer glow, an invitation to embrace the beauty of San Francisco unhurriedly.",
