    "weather_report": "As the city sighs into the early hours of Sunday, Downtown San Francisco is waking to a crisp, mostly clear night, with pleasant temperatures hovering around 48 degrees. A gentle west-southwest breeze rustles through the streets, offering a hint of warmth as it carries the scent of the bay. It\u2019s the kind of night where the air feels fresh against your skin, inviting a stroll among the quiet, dimly lit streets, perhaps pulling a light jacket close against the coolness that accompanies the calm.\n\nAs the sun ascends towards its midday glory, the forecast promises a bright transformation. By noon, the skies will be generous, mostly sunny, casting that golden light that makes this city of contrasts sparkle. The high is expected to flirt with the mid-60s before settling again into the gentle embrace of the afternoon\u2019s coolness. While a thin veil of fog may touch the edges of the bay, the heart of the city\u2014your favorite corner caf\u00e9s, bustling markets, and tranquil parks\u2014will remain bathed in clarity.\n\nDress in layers to adapt seamlessly to the shifts throughout the day; a light sweater over a comfortable tee will suffice, and don\u2019t forget a pair of sunglasses that match your spirit. With the weather lending itself to such delightful ambivalence, consider strolling along the Embarcadero, visiting the Ferry Building to sample artisanal delights, or simply enjoying a coffee on a sun-drenched bench while the world awakens before you. It\u2019s a perfect day for those small, treasured moments that tend to go unnoticed in the rush of life's busyness.",
