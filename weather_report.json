    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the air hangs heavy with a blanket of clouds, casting a muted light over the familiar cityscape. The high temperatures are teasing the chilly edge of fifty-eight, as a gentle west wind drifts lazily past, whispering promises of the rain to come. The sky, though predominantly gray, possesses a certain character, hinting at the transitions of spring. As the afternoon wanes, temperatures are expected to slide downwards, settling into the low forties later tonight.\n\nThe impending rain arrives just in time for the night, likely after the clock strikes eleven, bringing with it a palpable shift in atmosphere. With the predicted downpour comes a significant chance of precipitation, and as the clouds gather, the mood turns more contemplative and introspective. It\u2019s a night best suited for cozy gatherings indoors\u2014curling up with a book, indulging in cups of warm tea, or perhaps finding a nearby caf\u00e9 where the soft glow of lights invites lingering conversations. For those who must venture out, a light waterproof jacket and sturdy footwear would serve well against the damp chill. As always, the city\u2019s unique charm is amplified with each rain-soaked moment, painting the streets in hues of reflection and inspiration, perfect for wandering with open eyes and a receptive heart.",
