    "weather_report": "As the sun retreats into the horizon, the evening air in Downtown San Francisco carries a mild chill, with clouds building a soft veil across the sky. A subtle promise of rain flutters through the breeze, particularly in the early hours, when light showers may dance between 3 and 5 AM. The temperature hovers around a comfortable 50 degrees, though the west wind whispers reminders of the brisk intimacy of the Bay. \n\nSunday seems poised to usher in a similar ambiance; morning may see a few lingering showers, but soon the clouds will dominate, with a high around 56, gradually giving way to a cooler afternoon breeze. Dress in layers, perhaps a light jacket accompanied by a cozy scarf, as the winds may occasionally gust with purpose. This is a day for quiet contemplation or a gentle stroll along the waterfront, a visit to a nearby caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or maybe a laid-back gathering with friends indoors, where the atmosphere is lively yet comfortably sheltered from the unpredictable nature outside.",
