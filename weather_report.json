    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night wraps its cool arms around the city as the clock ticks past midnight. A sense of anticipation lingers in the air, punctuated by a whisper of rain poised to grace the streets. The clouds, heavy and foreboding, conceal the stars, ushering in a tranquil yet somber ambiance. With temperatures settling near a brisk 49 degrees, a low northeast wind meanders through the alleyways, hinting at the chill that awaits.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the sky will yield a steady rain, clinging to the pavement like a memory. By midday, a soft, persistent patter will envelop the city, transforming the familiar sights into a watercolor landscape, with the fog lazily wrapping around the Golden Gate, softening hard edges and casting everything in muted tones. The forecast suggests accumulated rainfall, perhaps between a quarter to half an inch, creating puddles that reflect the melancholy sky. Such weather calls for thoughtful attire\u2014a warm, waterproof coat layered over a comfortable sweater, combined with sturdy shoes, perfect for an impromptu stroll through the damp park or a quiet coffee shop visit, where one can observe the urban rhythm from a cozy corner. The day may not offer the brilliant blue skies San Francisco is known for, but it possesses a certain introspective beauty that can be savored, like a warm cup of cocoa on the cusp of winter.",
