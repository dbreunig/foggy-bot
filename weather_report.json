    "weather_report": "Beneath the vast expanse of a starlit sky, Downtown San Francisco embraces the serene embrace of a mostly clear night, a gentle precursor to the promising day ahead. As dawn nears, the temperature rests comfortably in the mid-fifties, accompanied by a soft breeze sweeping in from the west. The tranquility of this early morning hints at the warmth that will unfurl with the coming sun\u2014the kind of warmth that encourages leisurely strolls along the waterfront or quiet moments with a book in a sun-drenched park.\n\nTuesday will soon unveil its sunny disposition, casting a delicate light across the city's famed hills. Highs will flirt with the mid-sixties, a perfect backdrop for exploring the eclectic neighborhoods or indulging in a mid-morning coffee at a hidden caf\u00e9. The winds, gentle at first, will pick up slightly by the afternoon, making it advisable to layer your clothing: a light jacket will serve well against the crispness, while a short-sleeved shirt will keep one comfortable as the sun climbs higher. While the fog may have retreated for the moment, the memory of its fleeting presence lingers in the air\u2014an invitation to keep an eye on the weather as the day unfolds. As the time for exploration approaches, consider visiting a nearby garden or the bustling Ferry Building, where the aromas of fresh produce and baked goods mingle in the air, creating a tapestry of flavors and experiences to savor against the backdrop of a clear, vibrant day.",
