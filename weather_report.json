    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the evening, Downtown San Francisco emerges from a veil of clouds that envelops the city, leaving a soft chill in the air. The temperature hovers around a comfortable 56 degrees, accompanied by a gentle breeze that whispers through the streets, adding a touch of freshness to the night. As the city drifts into twilight, the clarity is compromised with a dense marine layer lingering at the edges, hinting at a typical San Francisco evening shrouded in mystery, where visibility falters just beyond a few city blocks.\n\nAs the dawn approaches tomorrow, expect the sun to break free, casting light across a mostly sunny sky with temperatures nudging towards 66 degrees, a delightful contrast to tonight's cool embrace. In the afternoon, as the warmth seeps in, the temperature is likely to settle around 64, creating an atmosphere that invites exploration. With the wind gently shifting from the west-southwest, it would be wise to wear layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a short-sleeved top\u2014to navigate the playful fluctuations of warmth and coolness throughout the day. Ideal activities would include a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where one can sip a warm drink while taking in the view of the awakening city, enjoying the fleeting moments before the hustle of the day takes full hold.",
