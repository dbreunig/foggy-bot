    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the atmosphere is a blend of muted tranquillity and shared anticipation. The afternoon unfolds under a mostly cloudy sky, the light graying as temperatures hover near 58 degrees, a subdued environment that hints at the rain on the horizon. The west wind, gentle yet persistent, carries whispers of the sea, teasing the edges of this urban landscape, urging residents toward layers that can guard against the impending chill.\n\nAs evening approaches, the day\u2019s brief clarity gives way to a heavy blanket of clouds. A 90% chance of rain looms past 11 PM, promising a few hours of gentle mist before settling into a steady fall, inviting residents to prepare for the cozy embrace of indoor pursuits. With temperatures dropping to a low of around 49, the comfort of a light jacket becomes essential, an invitation to wrap oneself in a moment of solitude or connection with friends over warm drinks. The promise of rain brings the heart\u2019s desire to stay in, yet for the adventurous spirit, the crisp evening air may call for a stroll through the city\u2019s illuminated streets, where the scent of damp earth mingles with the city\u2019s pulse.",
