Currently, a tranquil breeze whispers through the streets, creating a comfortable atmosphere that beckons locals to step outside and enjoy the crisp air. As the afternoon draws near, expect a subtle shift; temperatures will gently retreat towards the lower sixties, hinting at the brisk embrace of evening. \n\nThough today\u2019s outlook seems predominantly clear, a nebulous layer of fog is poised to sweep in later, particularly between the early morning hours when the city tends to sleep under a soft blanket. As twilight approaches and clouds gather, the temperature will dip, calling for a light layer\u2014perhaps a well-loved jacket or a cozy cardigan to wrap around oneself as the chill settles in. With such weather, the city invites a stroll along its iconic waterfront or a quiet sit at a caf\u00e9, where the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the salty air. Those inclined might explore the vibrant local art scene or simply wander through the streets, allowing the sights and sounds of the city to unfold organically. Today holds a pleasant promise, a day best enjoyed at your own pace.",
