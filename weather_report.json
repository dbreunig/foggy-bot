    "weather_report": "The afternoon light graces Downtown San Francisco with warmth and clarity, as the sun casts a golden glow across the cityscape. With temperatures nearing 71 degrees, the air feels inviting yet fresh, buoyed by a gentle westward breeze that waltzes through the streets. The famous fog, which often envelops the bay with a shroud of mystery, remains notably absent today, leaving the Golden Gate Bridge visible and majestic against a backdrop of blue skies. This is a moment to embrace the city's iconic landmarks with keen eyes, perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a local cafe where the aroma of fresh coffee dances in the air.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the pleasant evening promises clear skies with temperatures dipping to a comfortable 52 degrees. It\u2019s advisable to layer\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a jacket to ward off the coolness once the sun descends. For those looking to relax or socialize, a gathering at a rooftop bar or a casual walk by the waterfront could be the perfect way to enjoy this temperate day, allowing the subtle nuances of city life to unfold as evening settles in.",
