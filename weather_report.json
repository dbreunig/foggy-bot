    "weather_report": "As the morning sun begins to assert its gentle warmth over Downtown San Francisco, remnants of last night\u2019s drizzle linger in the air, giving way to a promising day. The sky unfolds in vibrant blues, casting a bright light across the iconic cityscape, while the light west-southwest breeze whispers through the streets. With temperatures expected to peak near 78 degrees, the warmth is a welcome invitation to step outside as the day progresses, although it will ease into a comfortable afternoon, cooling slightly to about 73. \n\nWhile the early haze from the marine layer has receded, leaving the Golden Gate Bridge and city skyline sharply outlined against the azure backdrop, a few feathery clouds may play coy in the distance. This day feels remarkably agreeable, a perfect canvas for casual outings\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to one of the many local cafes, where one might savor a fresh brew while watching the world pass by. Dressing in layers will ensure comfort throughout the day; a light jacket or sweater could provide a perfect balance as the sun begins to set and temperatures dip towards a quiet 59 tonight.",
