    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds quietly, treated to a gentle mix of sun and lingering clouds. A slightly damp air pervades, hinting at the 20% chance of drizzle, which may brush past before the sun has its chance to fully emerge. The temperature hovers around 63, an inviting warmth tempered by an afternoon dip to about 61, suggesting a need for layers as the breeze carries a soft chill through the streets. Southwest winds whisper through the city, casting rustling leaves against the backdrop of a sky that still holds some hazy uncertainty.\n\nAs the day beckons, one might find joy in exploring the hidden corners of the Mission District, indulging in a cup of local pour-over coffee while watching the world wake with the sunlight filtering through the soft clouds. Dress light but wisely\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a tee will suffice, preparing for those layers as the sun dips lower. With the raw edge of morning fog giving way to the promise of clearer skies, it feels like a day ready for possibility. Strolling along the Embarcadero or lounging in Washington Square Park could provide the perfect respite, granting a moment to soak in the gentle energy of the city awakening around you.",
