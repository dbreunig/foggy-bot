    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the murmur of the city stirs under a soft veil of clouds, with the temperature gently resting around a mild 59 degrees. The air is crisp, carrying a whisper of the oceanic breeze. By mid-morning, the sun will lift that shroud, revealing a glorious blue sky, while temperatures hover in the pleasant range of the late 60s. Yet, as the day wears on, a subtle shift will send those numbers slightly lower, hinting at the capricious nature of this coastal enclave.\n\nThough the day promises clarity and warmth, the remnants of the marine layer can be spotted hanging close to the horizon, a gentle reminder of the Pacific\u2019s presence. The character of the day beckons casual comforts; a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the cool gusts that twirl and dance at the fringes of the city. With a brisk wind swirling, it\u2019s an ideal moment for an invigorating walk along the Embarcadero, perhaps pausing at a market stall for a warm coffee, or losing oneself among the curated aisles of a local bookstore. This time of year offers a fleeting balance\u2014sweet enough to wander, but cool enough to remind us of the ocean's breath lingering just beyond.",
