    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a canopy of vibrant blue, the sun preparing to push back against the lingering coolness of the night. The high temperature promises to climb to a balmy 67 degrees, with a gentle breeze from the west southwest adding a crisp, refreshing touch to the atmosphere. As the day progresses, the warmth will subtly shift, dipping slightly as the afternoon Ages towards evening. Currently, the horizon is adorned with soft wisps of marine layer that may occasionally rise, hinting at the fog's persistent presence typical of our coastal charm. \n\nTonight, as the city settles into its rhythm, partly cloudy skies will invite the moonlight to dance across tranquil streets, with temperatures easing into a comfortable 56 degrees. In terms of attire, light layers are recommended\u2014perhaps a sweater or a light jacket for comfort as the cool breeze hints at the sea combined with the warmth of the sun. The day beckons a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, as the sea air invigorates and the views sparkle against the backdrop of a slowly stirring city. Alternatively, consider a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for an early morning pastry while enjoying the unfolding day.",
