    "weather_report": "As twilight casts its gentle shroud over Downtown San Francisco, the evening promises a tranquil respite. Partly cloudy skies cradle the city, with a brisk west-southwest wind whispering softly at speeds that could barely unfurl a well-pressed letter. The temperature hovers comfortably around 48 degrees, encouraging light layers that blend warmth and ease. \n\nThe sun's tomorrow ascent will paint mostly sunny expanses, peering down upon a high near 64, briefly succumbing to cooler afternoon air that nudges temperatures closer to a cozy 62. The delightful conditions beg for leisurely strolls through the neighborhood, perhaps along the Embarcadero where the rhythmic dance of the Bay meets newfound warmth, the slow lap of waves offering a serenade to evening contemplation. Gentle layers remain wise; a light jacket or sweater will harmonize with both the balmy sunlit hours and the cooler shadows cast by the city's iconic skyline. \n\nThe marine layer, while playing coy tonight, will likely recede by dawn, offering clarity and broad vision across the horizon. As the city sighs beneath a soothing calm, it invites you to surrender to the simple pleasures of the day ahead\u2014be it a quiet cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or a meandering walk through the vibrant streets, beckoning discovery amidst familiar sights.",
