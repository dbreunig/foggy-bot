    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks, Downtown San Francisco is cloaked in a serene embrace of cloudy skies. The temperature hovers gently around a mild 55 degrees, inviting a sense of calm. There is a whisper of drizzle clinging to the air, hinting at nature's playful touch. The west-southwest winds, light and unyielding, weave through the streets, promising a coming clarity as the day progresses. By midday, sunshine will cast its warmth over the city, and the high will flirt with 64 degrees. \n\nThough the haze hangs low, obscuring a clear view of the Golden Gate Bridge, don\u2019t be deceived. The light drizzle is not enough to spoil the day; rather, it nurtures the earth, adding a vibrant sheen to this iconic setting. As the fog gradually unveils the cityscape, a light jacket or sweater would be wise for those venturing out early. Once the clouds part and the sun warms the day, a comfortable t-shirt layered with a light sweater will bridge the gaps between sun and shadow. Consider a gentle stroll along the waterfront, or perhaps a leisurely visit to one of the city's intimate caf\u00e9s. Take a moment to savor the ambiance\u2014the rhythmic lapping of waves, the distant sounds of vibrant life, all rendered more vivid with every change in the weather.",
