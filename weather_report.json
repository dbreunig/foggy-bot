    "weather_report": "As night blankets Downtown San Francisco, a soft hugging of fog brushes the edges of familiar sights, promising a mystery beneath the clouds. The current air feels cool, with the temperature residing comfortably in the low fifties, as gentle breezes ripple through the evening. The faintly illuminated outlines of buildings fade into the soft shroud, creating a scene that is at once serene and hauntingly beautiful. Tonight\u2019s cloud coverage casts a muted, calming glow, making evening escapades inviting yet tinged with chill.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the fog will linger in the morning, teasing the city\u2019s awakening before its retreat, yielding mostly cloudy skies. The day shall edge into the low sixties, becoming a touch cooler as afternoon settles in. Dressing in layers feels wise\u2014perhaps a light sweater paired with a scarf to combat the coolness, while still allowing comfort for a leisurely walk through an art exhibit or a quiet caf\u00e9 visit. As day turns to dusk, a stroll along Embarcadero, with the rhythm of waves lapping at the shore, becomes a fitting choice; a simple activity that embraces the beauty of San Francisco\u2019s ever-evolving landscape.",
