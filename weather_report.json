    "weather_report": "A gentle warmth embraces Downtown San Francisco this morning, tinted by the faint, golden hues of sunlight. With temperatures expected to gracefully peak around 69 degrees, the day invites you to bask in its mild glow. The air carries a comfortable freshness, courtesy of the southwest winds whispering softly at 3 to 12 mph. Though clear skies prevail, the distant embrace of the Golden Gate Bridge hints at the marine layer's subtle presence, softly cloaking parts of the coast in a delicate mist, leaving the city just a touch ethereal.\n\nAs the afternoon approaches, a slow descent beckons, with temperatures likely to ease into the mid-60s. Yet, the evening promises a gentle transformation, where partly cloudy skies will cradle the night, wrapping you in a comfortable 54 degrees. For today\u2019s attire, a light sweater over a simple t-shirt should suffice, balancing that warm midday sun with the cool of evening's approach. Perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, or a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9 tucked away from the bustling streets will offer just the right kind of pleasure, allowing you to soak in the tranquility of a San Francisco day that dances between sun and fog.",
