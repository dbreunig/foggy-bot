    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a soft veil of mist drapes over the city. There's a whisper of drizzle lingering in the air, a gentle reminder that while the sun may be attempting its ascent, the marine layer still holds sway. The high, previously promised, is nudging up to 58 degrees but is gradually falling, suggesting an early transition into the evening coolness. The breeze, a brisk companion at 9 to 13 mph, carries with it the scent of salt and distant echoes of the Pacific.\n\nTonight, as you retreat from the day, the skies will clear, inviting a tranquility that hints at stillness and reflection. With temperatures dipping to a crisp 46, and even rising a tad overnight, layers will be your friend. A light sweater paired with a windbreaker can cultivate comfort if you wander outside to savor the fresh air. Consider a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the water glistens under the emerging stars, or perhaps a quiet evening of reading by the window, watching as the city settles into its nightly rhythm. The atmosphere is tinged with the promise of renewal; the day may have begun overcast, but it ends with a clarity drawing us closer to the beauty of the night.",
