    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the soft embrace of a marine layer lingers over the evening landscape, with a gentle murmur of drizzle expected between the hours of 11 PM and 5 AM. The clouds, a silvery shroud, suggest a night spent enveloped in the cool embrace of moisture, as warmth wafts in from the southwest, nudged along by a breeze that breathes softly at 9 to 15 miles per hour. The air maintains a pleasantly cool demeanor, hovering around 56 degrees, ideal for a light sweater or perhaps a light jacket if one ventures outdoors after dark. \n\nTomorrow promises a reprieve as the sun peeks through the clouds, offering a radiant glow that casts a spell over the cityscape, reaching a high near 62 degrees. The day will unfold with mostly sunny skies and a continued gentle breeze, creating a delightful atmosphere perfect for a stroll along the waterfront or a serene afternoon spent sipping coffee at a local caf\u00e9. While the fog may momentarily veil iconic landmarks, the city is poised to reveal its beauty just behind that cloudy curtain\u2014an invitation for the curious to explore its streets, where the gentle murmur of life awaits beneath the lifting mist.",
