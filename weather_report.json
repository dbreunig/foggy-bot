    "weather_report": "As dawn begins to break over Downtown San Francisco, the crisp air carries with it the promise of a clear day ahead. The skies are free of the familiar fog that often blankets the city, a welcome sight for those weary of marine layers obscuring their views. With temperatures expected to reach a gentle high near 61, the day will slowly transition from refreshing coolness in the morning to a temperate warmth by midday, followed by a slight dip as afternoon settles in. The light breeze swirling from the northwest stirs the air, adding an invigorating touch to the sunny ambience.\n\nIn light of this pleasant forecast, one might choose to don layers, perhaps a light sweater complemented by a brisk windbreaker\u2014ideal for those early hours and the inevitable chill that returns with evening. Today's inviting conditions beckon residents to explore the city's intricate streets. A slow-paced wander along the Embarcadero, taking in the harbor's tranquility, or a visit to a local coffee shop for a warm cup could turn a simple Friday into a cherished ritual. As the sun casts its final warm rays, perhaps one could take a moment to observe the changing light over the Pacific, a fitting closure to the day.",
