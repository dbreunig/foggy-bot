    "weather_report": "As the sun sinks below the horizon, Downtown San Francisco drapes itself in a cloak of twilight, rich with the promise of calm yet enigmatic weather. There is a hint of moisture lingering in the air, a mere whisper of rain that flutters before 11 p.m. tonight, heralding a temperature that will slip gently to around 44 degrees, before creeping up to a cooler 46 later on. The Northwest wind, with its decisive gusts, dances through the streets at 10 to 17 mph, carrying with it a hint of chill that speaks to the restless nature of this coastal city.\n\nTomorrow, the clouds will part to reveal a sun-soaked day, inviting the city to bask under its generous embrace. A high near 57 beckons inhabitants outdoors, with temperatures that should inspire light jackets or cozy sweaters, garments that meld style with practicality against the brisk breeze. In this inviting climate, one might find delight in leisurely strolls through the Presidio, the crisp air invigorating despite the fading light. Alternatively, finding a cozy caf\u00e9 along the Embarcadero, one can savor a warm drink while watching the waves lapping against the shore. The scene is resonant with the rhythms of urban life, where the fog that so often blankets this region is simply a distant memory.",
