    "weather_report": "The air is tinged with the scent of impending rain as Downtown San Francisco prepares for a day where the clouds reign supreme. A veil of gray spreads across the sky, gathering strength for showers that will dance on the pavement later this afternoon. Even now, gusts stir the atmosphere, swirling with that familiar bite of the west-southwest wind. The temperature hovers in a cool embrace, offering a gentle reminder of the season, with a promise that as the day unfolds, the mercury will dip just enough for a thick sweater to offer comfort.\n\nAs fog drapes lazily over the edges of the Golden Gate, the horizon remains discernible, yet not entirely clear; the marine layer creeps inland, hinting at its presence but mostly holding back for now. In spite of the clouds, some might find joy in this muted light\u2014ideal for a quiet stroll through the streets or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 where the warmth of a hot drink complements the chill outside. Come evening, the expected rain will spill forth, so having an umbrella handy would be prudent while venturing out for a brief errand or a rendezvous with friends. Dress in layers; comfortable yet slightly rugged clothing will serve well to embrace the splendor of this atmospheric shift.",
