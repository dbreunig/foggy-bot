    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun bathes the city in a warm glow, ushering in a high temperature around 70 degrees. The breezy west-southwest winds whisper through the streets, hinting at an invigorating day ahead, though the occasional gust might ruffle those unprepared for nature\u2019s flirtations. The sky unfolds with clarity; a few wispy clouds dance above, merely playful reminders of the marine layer that persists just beyond the horizon, likely tucked away between the Golden Gate and the Pacific, preserving the city\u2019s unique personality. \n\nAs evening approaches, expect the gentle embrace of partly cloudy skies, with temperatures settling around 56 degrees. A light jacket will serve well to ward off the evening chill, should you decide to take a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps enjoy a quiet moment at one of the local caf\u00e9s, where the air is filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the salt of the sea. Take advantage of the pleasant day by wandering through the heart of the city or visiting a quaint bookstore, letting the rhythm of life in San Francisco coax you into its vibrant embrace.",
