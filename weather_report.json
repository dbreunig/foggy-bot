    "weather_report": "As the night lingers over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds wraps the city, reminiscent of soft whispers in the cool coastal air. The temperature sits comfortably around 61, allowing for a light wrap of fabric\u2014perhaps a cardigan or a thin jacket\u2014ideal for staving off the night's chill. In the coming hours, the skies are expected to shift to a tendency for rain, though the chance remains slight, a mere 20% as it approaches the late afternoon. The sun will make its attempt to brighten the day, demanding a reluctant embrace from the clouds above, with highs reaching toward the genteel warmth of 69.\n\nWhile a soft Southwest wind caresses the city\u2019s iconic hills at speeds of 5 to 14 mph, one may perceive a twinge of stratified mist creeping in from the Pacific, lending an exotic intrigue to the familiar skyline. Caution may be warranted for those with plans along the waterfront, where the marine layer may obscure views of the Golden Gate, shrouding the bridge in a ghostly allure. The day unfolds with an ambivalence that invites casual exploration\u2014perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero or a cozy afternoon in a favorite caf\u00e9, where the fragrance of brewed coffee mingles with the salty breeze. \n\nFor those inclined to embrace the serendipity of a San Francisco afternoon, ensure companions are attired in layers, prepared for both the unexpected chill and the allure of sun peeking through the clouds. Whatever one chooses, the city waits patiently, its pulse synchronized with the waves that lap at its shores.",
