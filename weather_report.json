    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco enjoys a sunlit morning, the warmth intensifying as the day unfolds. The forecast hints at delightful sunshine, reaching a high of 67 degrees, though a slight coolness may wrap itself around the afternoon as temperatures retreat to the mid-60s. A gentle west wind whispers through the streets, occasionally growing a bit more boisterous with gusts that could stir the leaves. As twilight approaches, a hint of drizzle is expected after 11 PM, a soft serenade for those wandering homeward under mostly cloudy skies.\n\nLooking toward the Golden Gate and beyond, the clarity is momentarily unblemished, yet one might sense the marine layer's presence not too far off, likely clinging to the coastal edges. The gentle embrace of the day invites comfort without heaviness: a light sweater or a breezy jacket would be wise companions. As evening approaches, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet visit to a neighborhood caf\u00e9 may offer solace in the lingering warmth of the day. And perhaps as night falls, a cozy seat in a nearby bar, looking out over the bay, could set the scene for quiet contemplation amid the city\u2019s rhythm.",
