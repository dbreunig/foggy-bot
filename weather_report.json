    "weather_report": "As dawn gently unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, the city embraces a soft, muted palette, cloaked in light drizzle and an overarching blanket of clouds. The temperature, resting comfortably around 58 degrees, speaks to the cool embrace of the morning breezes that whisper through the streets. A gentle west-southwest wind stirs, only a modest current, but enough to carry the telltale scent of salt from the bay, hinting at the ocean\u2019s presence just beyond the fog. Visibility may be limited, as fog and mist gather in secretive corners, lending the city an ethereal quality, particularly around the iconic shapes of the Golden Gate Bridge, where obscured peaks reach towards the heavens, almost shyly.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect this patchy drizzle to taper off by late morning, offering a glimpse of sunlight\u2014albeit still partially veiled. By the afternoon, temperatures will dip slightly, creating a delicate balance as the day warms ever so gently around 64 degrees. Dress in layers, choosing comfort and versatility; perhaps a light jacket that shields against the lingering moisture, easily shed when warmth beckons. The overcast may sway one\u2019s plans for outdoor adventures, yet the beauty of a stroll through a quiet park or a leisurely caf\u00e9 visit, savoring a warm beverage, seems all the more appealing on such a day. With the slightly brisk air invigorating your senses, it might be the perfect time to ponder life\u2019s little delights or gather with friends. The city, wrapped in its distinctive charm, remains inviting; even beneath the clouds, it invites exploration and reflection.",
