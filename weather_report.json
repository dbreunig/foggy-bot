    "weather_report": "Tonight, as the clock inches toward the early hours, Downtown San Francisco lies shrouded in a hazy embrace, with a gentle promise of drizzle whispering through the cool air. The skyline is mostly obscured by a blanket of clouds, painting a picture that feels both tranquil and introspective. The temperature hovers around a mild 56 degrees, entreating you to wrap yourself in a cozy sweater or light jacket as the west-southwest winds dance through the streets, their lively gusts hinting at the city's wild, restless spirit. \n\nTomorrow, expect a continuation of this cloudy palette, punctuated by the possibility of drizzle lingering up until mid-morning. The high will gracefully peak at around 63 degrees, slowly slipping into a more subdued warmth as the afternoon unfolds. Marrying elegance with practicality, your best attire would be layers\u2014perhaps a light scarf to combat the morning chill and comfortable shoes that beckon leisurely strolls along the waterfront. The air is laced with the soft scent of the ocean, inviting those with a wandering spirit to explore the hidden corners of the city, perhaps indulging in a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9 or meandering through the lush tranquility of Golden Gate Park as the fog ebbs and flows like a gentle tide.",
