    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, this afternoon unfolds with a gentle warmth, marked by clear skies that glisten with the promise of a pleasant evening. As the sun brushes against the horizon, temperatures hover around a mild 64 degrees, while a brisk west wind dances through the streets, imparting that invigorating edge typical of the Bay Area. Tonight, clouds will drift in, weaving a soft gray shroud over the city, as nighttime temperatures settle around a comfortable 54 degrees, accompanied by a slightly stronger wind that stirs the air.\n\nThe city\u2019s charm persists, even as it prepares for the embrace of nighttime. The marine layer, though present, does not impose its grip just yet; it looms just beyond, ready to blanket the coast in its ethereal cloak of fog. As you venture outdoors, a light jacket or sweater will suffice against the cooling breeze, especially if you plan to linger as twilight descends and the stars begin to twinkle against the fading light. The atmosphere beckons you to wander the city\u2019s streets, perhaps seeking the hidden nooks where the evening's stillness invites contemplation. Engage with a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink, or take a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the soft sounds of the waves provide an enchanting backdrop to the city\u2019s evening lullaby.",
