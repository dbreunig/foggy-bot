    "weather_report": "The city breathes in a hush of clarity tonight, as the skies above San Francisco settle into a mostly clear night, with the air feeling crisp and refreshing. As the low dips to around 47 degrees, the gentle west-northwest winds carry whispers of ocean salt, enhancing the evening's stillness. In this hour, the city lights twinkle like stars scattered across the ground, inviting a quiet stroll through its fog-draped streets.\n\nTomorrow promises a shift into mostly sunny skies with temperatures reaching a pleasant 59, before gracefully settling to around 57 in the afternoon. The silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge will stand proud against an azure backdrop, and one can expect the marine layer to be a fleeting memory as the day unfolds. A light jacket will suffice against the lingering chill, with layers encouraged for the midday warmth. Embrace the day by visiting a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee dances in the air, perfect for pairing with a good book\u2014or perhaps take a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, soaking in the tranquility of the bay. The city's charm is palpable, making mundane moments feel like sweet escapes.",
