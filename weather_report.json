The predicted high nudges near 66, complementing the city's iridescent charm. As the late afternoon progresses, temperatures will slightly drop, but the vibrant blue overhead and the lively whirr of the west wind at 21 mph, gusting up to 26 mph, animate the scene\u2014an invitation to step outside and enjoy the breezy freshness.\n\nAs evening approaches, a slight chance of drizzle hangs in the air, just enough to foster a sense of mystery as clouds roll in, weaving together a tapestry of varying shades above. At approximately 57 degrees tonight, a light jacket or cardigan will ensure you maintain warmth against the cooling breeze. As the sun sets and the city\u2019s lights shimmer into view, the aftermath of a day well-spent could lead one to wander through the cobbled streets, perhaps setting down at a cozy caf\u00e9 to sip a warm brew, as the sound of distant waves provides a soothing soundtrack to the shift toward a more introspective night.",
