    "weather_report": "As twilight embraces Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity emerges, mingling with the briskness of the evening air. The forecast speaks of a starry night, with temperatures settling comfortably around 53 degrees, a perfect excuse to drape yourself in a light jacket and wander beneath the glowing streetlamps. The whispers from the West Southwest breeze, dancing at 21 mph, arrive with gusts that promise to remind you of the vibrant summer nights when the fog drifts lazily in and out, an artist's brush softening the skyline.\n\nIndependence Day beckons with promises of sunshine, though the late morning will wrap under a veil of chill until the warmth peaks near 62. Expect the familiar theatre of fog, a marine layer nudging at the edges, retreating only to allow moments of golden light to frolic across the Bay. A prelude to a perfect holiday, this day feels like an invitation to roam through the Presidio or take a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps pausing for a bite at a quaint caf\u00e9. Whether you indulge in a quiet picnic or relish the festive air of the Fourth, dress in layers to embrace both the cozy cool and the warmth of the day ahead.",
