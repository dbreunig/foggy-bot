    "weather_report": "In the embrace of a quiet San Francisco night, the sky hangs with a gentle haze, hinting at the beginnings of a particularly pleasant Wednesday. With the temperature dipping towards fifty degrees, a light west southwest breeze brushes past, whispering of clearer skies ahead. As dawn approaches, the city\u2019s iconic silhouette remains distinctly softened, shadows of landmarks blending into the muted palette of the waking world. \n\nThe day promises to unveil a luminosity nearly unparalleled for this time of year, with expectations for a mostly sunny disposition and temperatures nudging near fifty-eight. While the fog may linger lightly in some coastal corners, it appears determined to yield to the sun's warm embrace as it rises higher in the sky. Attiring oneself in layers would be wise\u2014consider a light sweater or jacket to fend off the remnant chill of the morning, later shedding it in favor of a breathable shirt as the sun casts its glow. The conditions invite a stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet visit to the Glen Canyon Park\u2014spaces where the world feels a touch more expansive against the crisp backdrop of a pleasant spring day, infused with a sense of casual exploration and introspection.",
