    "weather_report": "In the gentle embrace of a San Francisco night, the city drifts beneath a quilt of low clouds and wispy fog, concealing its vibrant heart from view. The air carries a coolness, reminiscent of the ocean, offering a soft invitation to the adventurous. As the clock ticks ever closer to dawn, those areas of fog are just beginning to stir, lingering close to the ground like secrets half-whispered, creating an ethereal ambiance that feels almost magical. \n\nAs the sun makes its tentative approach, Sunday promises an early patch of fog that will dissolve, revealing a day predominantly draped in clouds. The high will flirt with the early sixties, only to retreat, reminiscent of an artist reluctant to complete their masterpiece. Dressing in layers will be wise; a light sweater or jacket will welcome you warmly as you step out into the brisk air, perhaps complemented by comfortable shoes for a stroll through the city's storied streets. As day breaks and the fog dissipates, it would be a delightful opportunity to enjoy a simple coffee in one of the local cafes, people-watching as the city shakes off its slumber. Or perhaps a quiet moment by the bay, where the water glimmers, inviting introspection amidst the persistent hum of life around you.",
