    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds beneath an inviting sun, casting warmth and light across the cityscape. With temperatures hovering around a comfortable 66 degrees, the breeze dances playfully, a gentle west-southwest wind teasing at 20 to 24 mph, occasionally gusting even stronger. The sky reveals itself as clear and bright, an ideal backdrop for the iconic silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and the bustling downtown core. Though the marine layer behaves like a shy guest, lingering just off the coast, it does not intrude upon the serenity of the day, leaving the horizon uncluttered and accessible.\n\nAs the sun begins its slow descent into the embrace of the evening, the temperature is expected to wane to a mild 56 degrees. The winds will calm slightly, moving to a still manageable pace but retaining that refreshing edge. Attire that layers warmly yet breathably is recommended\u2014perhaps a light sweater to slip on as twilight approaches, paired with a comfortable pair of shoes for wandering the scenic streets or visiting a local caf\u00e9. Today\u2019s balmy conditions invite one to stroll through the parks, consider a leisurely bike ride along the waterfront, or simply indulge in the calming act of people-watching while sipping a warm drink. San Francisco\u2019s charm is at play, giving everyone a chance to relish a slice of city life painted in hues of golden sun and soft evening whispers.",
