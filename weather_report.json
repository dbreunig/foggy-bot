    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city is beginning to awake under a mostly sunny sky that promises a day of mild temperatures and gentle breezes. With a high near 60, the cool, inviting air carries the faint smell of the ocean, whispering through the streets with a westward wind. This morning\u2019s freshness, however, comes with the remnants of a marine layer that clings to the outskirts of the skyline, particularly near the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, veiling its grandeur. \n\nAs the sun climbs higher, shadows will stretch and the atmosphere will gradually clear, yet the clouds may linger tonight, pulling a cozy blanket of grey down over the city. If you\u2019re stepping outside, consider a light jacket to ward off the coolness that accompanies the wind, especially as the day transitions into the evening with temperatures dipping to around 53. A simple stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely visit to an intimate caf\u00e9 could be just the remedy for this lovely, if brisk, day. The vibe is soothing, a perfect backdrop for lighthearted conversations or quiet reflection, as San Francisco unveils its charm beneath the shifting skies.",
