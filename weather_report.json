    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds lingers in the sky, wrapping the city in a cozy embrace of muted light. The crisp air carries whispers of the sea, a reminder of the Pacific\u2019s ever-looming presence, with temperatures hovering delicately around the mid-50s. A gentle southwest wind tugs at the sleeves of unsuspecting passersby, hinting at a more dynamic day ahead as the warmth of the sun gradually competes with the chill of the coastal breeze.\n\nLater, the afternoon will unfold with a blend of partly sunny spells and a playful chance of rain\u2014a capricious flirtation with the skies that is so typical of this region. As the day turns, the warmth will slightly dissipate, leading the temperature to slide into the low 60s. The call of the clouds might inspire a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet visit to one of the local cafes, where the comfort of a warm drink can be savored against the backdrop of the picturesque view. For those venturing outside, a light jacket will serve as a suitable companion, offering protection against the persistent breeze and an occasional sprinkle. \n\nIn this charming city where fog and sunshine dance with equal grace, today offers a delightful opportunity to embrace the gentle transitions of spring. Whether you find yourself lost amidst the historic streets or meandering near the water's edge, there's a shared promise in the air\u2014a tranquil reminder that even if the day starts cloudy, it will unfold into a tapestry of light and possibility.",
