    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Downtown San Francisco, the air is tinged with a cool and gentle breeze hinting at the west-southwest winds. The skies are mostly cloudy, which cast a soft gray hue across the city. Nightfall settles with a low temperature around a comfortable 57 degrees, allowing for a brisk but inviting evening stroll. The layering of clouds adds a touch of mystery to the lingering daylight, offering a visual spectacle that embodies the charm of this iconic city.\n\nLooking ahead, tomorrow promises a transformation as the sun breaks through, painting the landscape in vivid shades of blue and bringing warmth near 65 degrees. Despite a brisk southwest wind, it will be a day for the city to shine, perhaps with a hint of fog still visible in the outskirts, teasing at the marine layer that defines much of San Francisco\u2019s character. For those venturing out, a light jacket or sweater may offer comfort during the cooler moments, particularly as morning gives way to the brighter afternoon. This evening\u2019s ambiance might inspire a visit to a local caf\u00e9 or a casual meet-up with friends, where the warmth of conversation can easily melt away the chill of the night.",
