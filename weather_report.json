    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a predominantly sunny sky, offering a refreshingly clear view of the city and its iconic landmarks. With temperatures gently rising to around 62 degrees, the pleasant warmth beckons residents and visitors alike to take a stroll. A mild west-northwest wind stirs softly, ensuring the air remains invigorating rather than overwhelming. The golden hues of sunlight play over the buildings, casting long shadows that dance across the streets, while any trace of fog has retreated, leaving only clarity in its wake.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the evening promises a serene transition towards a cool 47 degrees, perfect for wrapping oneself in a light jacket or sweater. This clear, calm night invites contemplation and quiet activities, perhaps a leisurely walk along the waterfront or a visit to one of the charming caf\u00e9s, where one might enjoy a warm drink while watching the world go by. The absence of fog opens up a vista more akin to summer than winter, lending the city an air of promise and delight. Such exquisite conditions encourage gentle adventure; whether it be a simple exploration of the neighborhood or gathering with friends to bask in the glow of a sunset, the day offers a peaceful respite, happily unmarred by the familiar mist.",
