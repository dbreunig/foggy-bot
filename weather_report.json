The air is mild, wrapping you in a subtle warmth with hints of a light breeze whispering through. While the horizon reveals the soft embrace of the marine layer, billowing clouds can be seen kissing the city\u2019s edges, reminding us of the ever-present dance between land and sea. This morning, the picturesque fog clings closer to the hills, creating a dreamy contrast against the emerging sunlight.\n\nThe day ahead unfolds with a promise of bright sun and vibrant hues, as temperatures rise to a pleasant peak in the mid-60s, slowly descending into cooler breezes by afternoon. Embrace the morning with a light jacket, perfect for the slightly cool air, and consider opting for layers, as the sun will warm your spirit before the day eases into a serene close. The gentle gusts of wind, reaching up to 15 mph, encourage you to venture outdoors\u2014perhaps a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely visit to one of the city\u2019s charming caf\u00e9s. There\u2019s a calmness in the day that invites quiet reflection or simple enjoyment of life\u2019s smaller moments, as the city comes alive under the sunlit sky.",
