    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco is basking in a late afternoon glow that invites exploration. The skies are mostly sunny, with a gentle breeze weaving through the streets, offering a refreshing touch as temperatures hover in the comfortable mid-60s. While the sun casts a warm hue over the city, there is an undercurrent of anticipation in the air, hinting at the drizzle expected just after midnight. As the sun sets, clouds will begin to weave through the skyline, creating a partly overcast canvas that promises a tranquil evening. Although patches of fog are likely to encroach later, they remain shy for now, leaving the Golden Gate Bridge and the famed vistas viewable and inviting.\n\nThe west southwest winds, brisk yet invigorating, suggest that a light jacket or a cozy sweater would serve well as the day winds down, particularly with cooling temperatures around 57 degrees at night. With a chance of drizzle hovering at a modest 20%, it may be prudent to carry an umbrella, especially if you're among those who cherish spontaneous strolls along the waterfront or cozy dinners under the light of the Parisian-style street lamps. This kind of weather beckons one to find solace in quiet cafes or tucked-away bookstores, ideally with a warm beverage in hand, as the prospect of a peaceful night unfolds over the City by the Bay.",
