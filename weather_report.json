    "weather_report": "The night blankets Downtown San Francisco with a gentle moisture, the air thickening with patchy drizzle expected to softly begin after the witching hour. As the city breathes, clouds drift lazily, their presence shrouding the skyline and creating a muted canvas where the streets gleam faintly under dim streetlight glows. The current temperature lingers in the mid-fifties, presenting a cool embrace that, when combined with a light west-southwest wind, invites a modest layering of fabric favorable for the night.\n\nAs dawn breaks, expect the drizzle to wane but not vanish entirely, giving way to fleeting moments of sun that will punctuate the clouds. With a high approaching the mid-sixties, the day promises to flirt with warmth, as winds will carry a gentle rustle through the trees. However, the atmosphere will remain layered, the ever-so-familiar marine fog whispering along the coast, obscuring the distant grace of the Golden Gate Bridge, while playing coy with the city's skyline. For the discerning adventurer, the day is ripe for a stroll through Golden Gate Park or a relaxed visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the warmth of a fresh pastry and a good book can make time stand still. Wrap yourself in a light jacket or sweater, a practical choice to navigate both the kiss of the marine layer and the occasional embrace of sunlight.",
