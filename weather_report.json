    "weather_report": "As the clock gently ushers in the early hours, Downtown San Francisco finds itself under a blanket of clouds that will gradually yield to the sun, hinting at a pleasant start to the day. The low nighttime temperatures hover comfortably around the mid-fifties, and as the sun rises, the promise of mostly sunny skies beckons. A soft southwest breeze graces the air, whispering through the city\u2019s streets as it stirs the mist away from the shoreline, leaving a crisp clarity in its wake.\n\nBy midday, the warmth will reach a cozy sixty-six degrees, before gently retreating to sixty-four as the afternoon progresses. Here, the marine layer retreats, revealing the outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the rolling hills beyond. The day invites locals to seize the moment\u2014a coffee in hand as you wander through the Presidio's trails or perhaps a leisurely stroll along Crissy Field, where the water glimmers under the emerging sunlight, casting a shimmering reflection that dances with the waves. For those venturing out, a light jacket will suffice, offering just the right touch of warmth against the cool breeze. Today\u2019s conditions paint a serene backdrop for exploring the hidden gems of the city, whether it's an art exhibit in SoMa or a quiet afternoon in Golden Gate Park, promising a delightful experience in the heart of this vibrant metropolis.",
