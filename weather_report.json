    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in a mostly sunny glow, the air crisp and invigorating, yet beneath this radiant fa\u00e7ade, a gentle chill lingers. While the high temperature hovers around a temperate 65 degrees, expect the afternoon to weave its way toward a cooler, calmer 63, as the west-southwest winds parade through at about 21 mph. These breezes, occasionally gusting to 26 mph, serve as a reminder of the ocean's influence, stirring the air with both a refreshing and slightly brisk touch.\n\nAs the sun gives way to evening, the sky will cloak itself in a veil of cloud, hinting at a slight chance of drizzle after 11 PM. The temperature will nestle down to around a soft 57 degrees, making light layers essential for comfort. As the evening approaches, the city feels alive with the promise of understated adventure. A casual stroll along the waterfront, or perhaps a quiet moment spent sipping coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, would be delightful. Attire in soft, warm layers, embracing the mildness of the day while preparing for the evening chill, will keep one at ease. The marine layer will be nearby, flirting with the edges of the bay, promising to return as night descends, but for now, enjoy the clarity and charm of this San Francisco afternoon.",
