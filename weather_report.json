    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth embraces the city, sheltered under a mostly sunny sky. The air, crisp yet inviting, carries the soft whispers of a west-southwest wind, occasionally gusting to add a playful flutter to the day. With a high poised around 64 degrees, this mid-summer offering seems to whisper promises of leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or perhaps an escape to one of the quaint coffee shops nestled in the heart of North Beach.\n\nHowever, as twilight approaches, the city may gently usher in a slight chance of drizzle, especially after the clock strikes two. The clouds will gather, draping a delicate veil over the horizon, leading into the evening with a low of about 56 degrees. While the marine layer may linger, perhaps teasing the edges of the Golden Gate, today does not feel inherently dreary. The charm of San Francisco lies not only in its famous vistas but in its subtler moments, where a quick jaunt under the trees in the Presidio or a quiet moment with a book in Alamo Square could be just what the day calls for. For those venturing out, a light jacket would be wise, a cozy companion as you sink into the evening's embrace.",
