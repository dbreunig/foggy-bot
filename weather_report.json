    "weather_report": "The night drapes its veil over downtown San Francisco, the air crisp and cool, hinting at the embrace of a slightly chilly morning. As dawn approaches, a gentle unrest brews in the atmosphere, with wisps of clouds mingling in the sky, carrying traces of fog that sway like ghosts along the fringes of the bay. The warmth of the day is a distant promise, with expected sunshine breaking through as the sun rises in its steadfast journey towards the zenith. A breeze whispers of the west, caressing the skin, urging one to appreciate the soft transition.\n\nAs the daylight unfurls, you can look forward to a serene sky gradually taking on the vibrant hues of summer. Highs near sixty-five will beckon you outside, encouraging leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or perhaps indulging in a quiet coffee at your favorite caf\u00e9 while soaking in the gentle chaos of city life. For those with a penchant for exploration, the City by the Bay offers unhurried pathways for a thoughtful walk or a visit to a local gallery, allowing one to savor the understated beauty that the haze and warmth create together. Dressing in layers will be your best approach, as the morning chill lingers before giving way to the sun's mild embrace, creating an ideal palette to enjoy all that this city has to offer.",
