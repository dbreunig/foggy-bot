    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a curtain of soft clouds lingers, hinting at the day's gentle embrace. The air holds a brisk 54 degrees, underscored by the west-southwest winds whispering through the streets. As the morning light begins to weave its way between the buildings, you can expect a transition from this sleepy veil to a brighter, partly sunny disposition, with the temperature climbing to a modest 64, before retreating to a cool 61 as the sun migrates westward.\n\nThe charm of the city remains intact, even under the hazy cloak of marine layer that drapes over the bridge and the avenues alike. While the fog may momentarily obscure distant vistas, it adds a touch of mystery to your morning stroll. Dress in layers to accommodate the day\u2019s ebb and flow; a light jacket and comfortable shoes will serve you well as you explore the neighborhoods or perhaps sip coffee at a quiet caf\u00e9, savoring the hushed morning atmosphere before the day unfurls its busier rhythms. Whether wandering through the streets or finding a snug spot in the sun, this promise of a warm, yet tranquil afternoon should not be missed.",
