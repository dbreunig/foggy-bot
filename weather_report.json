    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun shines brilliantly overhead, gracing the city with a refreshing warmth as the high hovers near a comfortable 68 degrees. The air is crisp, with light breezes weaving through the streets, offering delightful whispers of spring. As the day progresses, temperatures are expected to dip slightly, settling around 65, while the western winds dance gently at 5 to 10 mph. There\u2019s an unmistakable clarity in the day\u2014a stark contrast often seen only in the early blush of summer, devoid of the usual fog that frequently blankets the Bay.\n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will transition into a soft hue of twilight, maintaining their mostly clear demeanor. A low around 52 welcomes the night, accompanied by gentle southwest winds, creating a perfectly cozy atmosphere for evening strolls or outdoor meals. Dress lightly but wisely; a light jacket or sweater could be a perfect companion as the air cools. This is an ideal time to wander through the city\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods, perhaps stopping by a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm beverage while the city lights begin to twinkle against the horizon.",
