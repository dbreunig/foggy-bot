    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the early morning hours hold a lingering promise of renewal, with the sky draped in a mottled blanket of clouds. A soft, whispering breeze carries the scent of damp earth, hinting at a chance of rain that, while not heavy, might provide a refreshing kiss to the day. The temperature settles around a mild 52 degrees, a gentle invitation for layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater paired with a water-resistant jacket to shield against the possibility of a drizzle. \n\nAs the city stirs awake, the forecast for midday reveals a metamorphosis; the clouds will gradually yield to sunlight, unveiling a canvas of blue by afternoon. Expect temperatures to hover pleasantly in the neighborhood of 60 degrees, with a slight dip in the late hours. Outdoor pursuits\u2014a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, or a quiet moment with a book at a sun-drenched caf\u00e9 terrace\u2014may just become the perfect antidote to the day's start. With a 30% chance of rain still echoing, the marine layer's presence is anticipated to dissipate, providing clarity and light to an evolving urban landscape. As you venture forth, embrace the charm of a day that oscillates between the cozy embrace of clouds and the warmth of the sun.",
