    "weather_report": "As the early morning hours gently transition into dawn across Downtown San Francisco, a cloak of cloudiness lays over the city, lending a soft, muted quality to the bustling streets below. The air carries a refreshing coolness, invigorating yet soothing, with temperatures hovering around 52 degrees. This delicate veil will gradually peel away as the day unfolds, revealing glimpses of sunlight that will break through the clouds, bringing warmth and a hint of vibrancy to the urban landscape. The anticipated high of 62 invites the city dwellers to cast aside their heavier garments; layers will suffice for those braving the drafts from the west-southwest winds, which will dance around at speeds touching 21 mph.\n\nWhile the marine layer clings to some corners, particularly in the vicinity of the Golden Gate, today's clarity looks promising. For those making plans, consider a stroll through the vibrant streets, perhaps a stop at a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a warm beverage as you watch the city awaken. With the sun's slow ascent, outdoor Art Walks beckon or a visit to the local park to enjoy the fresh air while it remains crisp is a fine choice. As the day progresses and the warmth settles in, a light jacket will suffice for the cooler moments. Perfect for embracing the city's temperate charm, today presents itself as a canvas where both locals and visitors can enjoy the subtle nuances of San Francisco.",
