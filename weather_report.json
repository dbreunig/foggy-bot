    "weather_report": "As the stillness of night casts its gentle embrace over Downtown San Francisco, the city breathes a hint of clarity, illuminated by the softened glow of streetlights filtering through a veil of partly clouded skies. Presently, the air is cool with whispers of a low 49, a minor chill carried by the north-northwest winds that rustle through the night\u2019s quiet streets. While one might expect a blanket of fog typical of these coastal realms, it appears that the marine layer is taking a recess, allowing a fleeting glimpse of stars punctuating the darkness.\n\nAs dawn approaches, Friday promises to unfold with mostly sunny skies, the temperature anticipated to reach near 60. However, a gentle drop to 56 in the afternoon suggests a layering of light clothing would circle the day nicely, with perhaps a cardigan or a light jacket ready for the cool breezes. Amidst this picturesque ambiance, it\u2019s a fine opportunity for a leisurely stroll down Market Street, taking in the rhythm of life unfurling\u2014stop by a hidden caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of coffee or wander through the local shops, letting the vibrant energy of the city cradle your senses. With clarity in the air, you may also find a spot near the water\u2019s edge to enjoy the tranquility, as quite the splendid day lies ahead.",
