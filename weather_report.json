    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over San Francisco, the horizon hints at the day to come. The lingering clouds from the night subtlety retreat, casting a soft veil over the cityscape; around 56 degrees, it feels cool but not unwelcoming. The rhythm of a gentle west-southwest breeze sweeps through the streets, carrying the fresh scent of the ocean, a promise of the sun to be unleashed later. As the morning unfolds, expect the warmth of the sun to peak at a comforting 66 degrees, with temperatures gracefully easing to around 64 in the afternoon.\n\nThe clarity of the day will reveal itself, though the marine layer may still linger in the embrace of the hills, suggesting that while the city is alive with activity, a soft haze may kiss the outskirts, particularly near the Golden Gate. For those venturing out, layers will serve as your best allies: a light jacket in the early hours will keep the chill at bay, and as the day evolves into the warmth of the afternoon, a quick roll-up of sleeves or shedding of layers will be in order. Embrace the beauty of this day by wandering through local parks, strolling the waterfront, or indulging in a cozy cafe, where the ambiance is as warm as the sun on your back.",
