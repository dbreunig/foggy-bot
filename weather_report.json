    "weather_report": "As the early hours of the morning unfold over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle hush rests upon the city. The air carries with it a coolness, hinting at the night's lingering embrace, the low temperature hovering around 52 degrees. A whisper of a west wind dances through the streets, contributing to the playful rustle of leaves and the subtle sound of nearby waves. The horizon, though partly clouded, holds promise; the clouds will soon yield to the sun's warm caress as the day advances.\n\nBy Friday, the promise of sunshine will illuminate the city, pulling the mist away from the Golden Gate and inviting residents to step outside. With a high near 62 degrees, the atmosphere shifts towards warmth, though a playful breeze will remain, blowing in from the west at 15 to 25 mph. Such a day suggests layers; a light jacket will keep the chill at bay when the wind picks up, making for a comfortable outing. With the gradual unveiling of the sky, it will be an ideal time to explore local coffee shops, stroll through the bustling streets, or sit by the ferry building, sipping a warm beverage as you watch the world drift by. Embrace the simplicity and beauty of this day, allowing the city to reveal itself at its own pace.",
