    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the air carries a gentle warmth, a fleeting embrace of sun before the mantle of marine fog settles in for the evening. As the day teeters between light and shadow, you can expect a high near 64 degrees, with the temperature delicately descending to around 62 as the sun begins to retreat. A refreshing west-southwest breeze, brisk but not biting, sweeps through the city, stirring a sense of vibrancy. Clouds gather slowly, promising a shift to mostly overcast skies tonight, where the temperature will linger around 57, begging a light layer for comfort.\n\nThe thick marine layer casts a subtle haze over the horizon, hinting at the iconic fog that so often rolls through, softening the edges of the city skyline. The golden rays are still managing to peek through intermittently, creating a picturesque contrast against the gathering clouds. As the weather plays its hand, consider a leisurely stroll through the waterfront, where the cool air mingles with the scent of salt and adventure. Alternatively, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 could offer the perfect moment to unwind, perhaps accompanied by a warm drink to ward off the evening chill. Dressing in layers is wise\u2014think a light sweater or jacket to combat the cooling air as dusk descends, letting you embrace both the lingering light and the encroaching fog without a second thought.",
