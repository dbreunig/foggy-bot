    "weather_report": "As the night embraces Downtown San Francisco, soft clouds dance across the sky, presenting a serene portrait of partial obscurity. The air holds a gentle chill around 49 degrees, a whisper of wind curling lazily from the west-northwest. For the discerning observer, the horizon may hold hints of a marine layer, but as the sun prepares to rise, clarity is promised by the dawn. Tomorrow, a polished mix of sunshine will decorate the afternoon, although a slight chance of rain will linger in the air after 5 PM, a mere flirtation with precipitation.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the temperatures will moderate to about 58 degrees by midday, tempting locals and visitors alike to enjoy the city\u2019s vibrant offerings. Dressing in layers will be wise\u2014a cozy sweater should suffice against the cool breeze, while sunglasses may soon become a welcome accessory as the sun stakes its claim over the sky. Early afternoon might be a splendid time for a leisurely stroll through the vibrant streets, perhaps indulging in a coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 or seeking the quiet beauty of a local bookstore. It is an ideal opportunity to breathe in the lively spirit of the city before the potential of evening rain reshapes tomorrow's activities into more inward pursuits.",
