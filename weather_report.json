    "weather_report": "As twilight approaches Downtown San Francisco, the skies are largely clear, embracing the city with a gentle embrace of warmth and tranquility. A light breeze whispers through the streets, echoing the soft tones of a mellow evening. The current temperature hints at a refreshing dip into the night, with the mercury poised to settle around a cozy 48. While the forecast mentions the possibility of a marine layer, the visibility today is notably good, with the iconic Golden Gate Bridge standing proud against a backdrop of azure skies, punctuated only by the occasional wisp of cloud.\n\nAs Sunday unfolds, expect a delightful promise of sunshine to greet you in the morning, ushering in a high near 64, which will gradually descend to a more temperate 62 as the day progresses. This perfectly mild weather invites the adventurous spirit to partake in a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps enjoy a meal at one of the many inviting caf\u00e9s dotting the neighborhood. Layering light fabrics will serve you well, allowing for comfort as the coastal breeze dances through the streets. Engage in modest pursuits today; perhaps a visit to an art gallery or a quiet moment spent in one of the city\u2019s charming parks, where the vibrant blossoms of spring go hand in hand with the serene atmosphere.",
