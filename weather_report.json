    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the sky is adorned with wisps of clouds that dance gracefully against a canvas of blue. The gentle sun pushes through, casting a bright but subdued light across the city, offering a brief respite before the rain makes its presence known later tonight. A stirring breeze from the west carries excitement, along with the promise of moisture; you may feel a hint of chill in the air as the temperature hovers near the low fifties.\n\nThe evening promises a shift, as rain begins its symphony post-11 pm, enveloping the city in a damp embrace, with whispers of thunder lingering in the distance. For now, take advantage of this transient clarity; perhaps a stroll through the quieter streets would be rewarding, or perhaps a leisurely visit to a nearby caf\u00e9 to watch the world swirl by, warm drink in hand. As the day cools, a light jacket will ward off the developing chill, while stepping outdoors later may call for an umbrella. Enjoy these fleeting moments before the waterworks begin, savoring every sun-dappled moment before the night wraps the city in its shadowy cloak.",
