The horizon, though shrouded in thick clouds, offers glimpses of the swirling city lights below, their warmth muted by the enveloping marine layer. Expect temperatures to settle around a cool 55 degrees, complemented by a light southwest wind whispering at 7 to 10 mph. This evening's atmosphere hangs heavy with anticipation, the promise of moisture palpable yet fleeting, with a slight 20% chance of persistent rain in the early hours.\n\nCome Tuesday, the sun breaks through the morning haze, transforming the day into a canvas of shifting light and shadows. Though the grip of drizzle lingers until around 11 AM, the skies are expected to clear, culminating in a mostly sunny afternoon. With highs reaching into the mid-60s, you'll feel a gentle breeze ushering in a more spirited atmosphere. Dressing in layers is advisable; a light jacket for the morning chill, perhaps, transitioning into something breezy for the midday warmth and ease of movement. On this pleasant Tuesday, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps grabbing coffee at a local caf\u00e9 while the city emerges from slumber\u2014it's the perfect moment to appreciate the unique character of San Francisco, with its blend of urban life and nature's beauty still lingering in the air.",
