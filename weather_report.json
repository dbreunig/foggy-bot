    "weather_report": "Good morning, San Francisco. As the day begins, the city is waking under a softly shifting sky, where patchy drizzle has played its part, giving way to the promise of sun. The high today approaches a comfortable 78, though expect temperatures to temper themselves to a gentle 73 as afternoon shifts into evening. A sweet, mild breeze whispers through the city, each gust caressing the skin, a subtle reminder of summer's lingering warmth. \n\nLooking toward the Golden Gate, a thin layer of fog may cling to the horizon, the marine layer still flirting with the edges of visibility, softly veiling the grandeur of the landscape while hints of clarity break through. As the sun makes its ascent, the cityscape below is infused with a radiance that encourages exploration. A light cardigan or a breezy button-up will suffice for the day and evening, offering just enough comfort in the cooler moments. For those seeking a slice of tranquility, perhaps a stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the many outdoor caf\u00e9s should suffice, allowing you to bask in the gentle transition of the day, observing life as it unfolds.",
