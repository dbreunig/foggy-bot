    "weather_report": "This morning in Downtown San Francisco greets you with a gentle hint of drizzle, a whisper of moisture that dances away before mid-morning. As the sun edges closer to its high, the atmosphere becomes partly sunny, promising warmth with a high that flirts around the low sixties. A soft west-southwest breeze offers a comforting caress, with gusts that weave through the streets, adding a delightful rhythm to the day. \n\nEvening will bring a quilt of partial clouds, wrapping the city in a cozy embrace as temperatures dip to a mild fifty-six \u2014 ideal for an evening stroll or enjoying a conversation on a patio. Dress in layers for the day\u2019s journey: a light sweater will suit well for the fresh morning air that clings to the skin, while a light jacket may become your trusted companion as twilight wraps its arms around the city. With the sun illuminating the buildings and the iconic skyline peeking through, consider a walk down to the waterfront or a quiet afternoon at a caf\u00e9, where the world becomes a little quieter and the flavors a little richer beneath the dancing sunlight.",
