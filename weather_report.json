    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is infused with a cool moisture that whispers of autumn's imminent arrival. Drizzle has graced the morning air, a gentle reminder of the city's storied climate, and as sunlight peeks through interspersed clouds, a muted brilliance casts a soft glow on the buildings below. The expected high hovers around a mild 66 degrees, giving way to a more temperate feel as the day unfurls, perfect for a stroll through the streets winding beneath the iconic skyline. The gentle push of a west-southwest breeze carries the hint of marine air, an energetic yet soothing presence that speaks to the ebb and flow of city life.\n\nAs day transitions toward night, patchy drizzle is anticipated to resume, cloaking the city in a light haze and imparting a cozy ambiance. With temperatures dipping to a low of 59, layering will be wise; a light sweater or jacket will keep the chill at bay while allowing one to embrace the city's dynamic rhythm. This is an ideal time for those feeling inspired to explore local cafes or perhaps take a peaceful walk along the waterfront, where the soft lapping of the waves merges with the gentle sounds of the city pulsing to life. Wrap yourself in the flavors of a warm drink, savor the ambiance, and let this unique San Francisco day characterize your moments before night settles in.",
