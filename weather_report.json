    "weather_report": "The evening air in Downtown San Francisco holds a crisp clarity that\u2019s become the hallmark of this vibrant city, particularly as night descends. With a low expected to hover around a cool 46 degrees, the breeze carries the soft whisper of the North Northwest, gently nudging the urban landscape into tranquility. As the night deepens, the temperature will gradually ascend, creating an inviting contrast to the cool air.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, anticipate a sunlit embrace. The forecast promises a high of 61 degrees, giving way to brighter moments before the afternoon shadows stretch. This day paints itself in hues of warmth, coupled with gentle breezes caressing the skin. With the absence of fog and the marine layer kept at bay, it's a splendid occasion to roam, perhaps savoring the slow pacing of a walk along the waterfront or indulging in the quietude of a local caf\u00e9's outdoor seating. Donning layers is advisable; a light jacket will serve well against the cool morning air, while the midday sun beckons for something a touch more comfortable. This weather invites simple joys, whether it be a leisurely read in the sun, an exploratory walk through a bustling neighborhood, or relishing the sea breeze in a park.",
