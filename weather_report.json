    "weather_report": "As dawn begins to paint the horizon with soft hues, Downtown San Francisco stirs under a predominantly cloudy cover. The temperatures hold steady at a gentle 55 degrees, accompanied by a reassuring southwest breeze whispering at twelve miles per hour. The streetlights are still flickering, casting a warm glow against the muted gray skies. The day ahead promises a transition; the clouds will gradually recede, allowing the sun to break through, bathing the city in a warm embrace come mid-morning.\n\nWhile the forecast hints at sunshine later, the marine layer is clinging stubbornly to the California coast, casting a shroud that will take its time to dissipate. Expect visibility to improve as the hours pass and the winds pick up\u2014growing bolder from the west-southwest, with gusts reaching upwards of thirty miles per hour. Dress in layers; a light jacket or cardigan will shield against the morning\u2019s chill, especially in shaded spots where the ocean\u2019s breath lingers. As you venture out, consider a leisurely stroll through the vibrant, open spaces of the Mission District or along the waterfront, perhaps finding an inviting caf\u00e9 with steaming coffee wafting in the air, a perfect blend of warmth against the cool morning. Look forward to discovering the little nooks of the city as it breathes and awakens, each corner revealing stories just waiting to unfold.",
