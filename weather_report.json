    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a wide expanse of blue sky, where sunlight dances playfully on the fa\u00e7ades of buildings. With a refreshing breeze from the west-southwest at a brisk 24 mph, this weather invokes a vibrant kind of clarity, ideal for leisure or light exploration. Temperatures may start at a comfortable 66 degrees but will gently yield to a cooler 62 as the day wanes, hinting at the marine layers hanging on the horizon, a familiar sight in this coastal city, but notably absent from the immediate landscape.\n\nAs the evening approaches, the sky\u2019s palette will shift to a soft, partly cloudy serenity, settling around a low of 54. The allure of this golden hour invites you to grab a light sweater or jacket, a simple companion against the developing chill. Perhaps an afternoon stroll through the Mission's murals, stopping for a bite at a quaint caf\u00e9, is in order. Alternatively, take a moment to sip a warm drink while enjoying that unique San Francisco ambiance that beckons with each cool breeze. Such is the charm of a day that balances brightness with the gentle reminders of the Pacific coast's ever-present embrace.",
