    "weather_report": "The air over Downtown San Francisco carries a gentle warmth, baked under a mostly sunny sky that inspires a soft contentment. Despite the high reaching into the mid-sixties, a cool breeze continues to weave through the streets, whispering reminders of the Pacific\u2019s embrace just beyond the city. As the afternoon unfolds, expect the temperatures to hover around a comfortable 62, with a west-southwest wind nudging at 10 to 14 mph, promising to keep the air feeling fresh. \n\nTonight, the evening clouds will thicken, cloaking the city in a veil of gray, and there\u2019s a slight chance of drizzle as the hours inch toward dawn. The low will settle around 56, creating an atmosphere perfect for cozy layers. As you step out today, a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the chill of the approaching night. The subtle art of San Francisco weather invites one to stroll along the Embarcadero or sip coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, as the world around transitions into a quieter evening filled with the soft murmur of the city life.",
