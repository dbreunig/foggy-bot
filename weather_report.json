    "weather_report": "As morning light graces Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a coolness, hinting at the moisture of the day to come. A canvas of partly sunny skies stretches overhead, the gentle hues complimented by whispers of fog skirting the Golden Gate, visible like a shy lover retreating just beyond reach. As you breathe in the brisk air, ideals of spring feel just on the cusp of becoming, but the charm of the city\u2019s oft unpredictable weather lingers. As the afternoon unfolds, expect a chance of rain after 5 PM, with the promise of clouds thickening and bringing in a cool breeze from the south-southwest.\n\nWhen venturing out, consider layering your attire. A comfortable jacket paired with a lightweight long sleeve shirt will serve you well, providing warmth against the wind while allowing your skin to experience the day\u2019s cool embrace. The forecast suggests a sprinkle of rain that could surprise the unprepared, but take solace in knowing that the city\u2019s rich culture and many cozy cafes await. Perhaps an afternoon stroll along the Embarcadero could be lovely, allowing you to soak up the views, or a visit to one of the many galleries could inspire your creative spirit, while the slight chance of rain provides an excuse to indulge in a warm coffee as the clouds gather above.",
