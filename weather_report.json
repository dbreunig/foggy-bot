With this weather, a light jacket or sweater would complement your attire well, particularly as night falls, best suited for an evening that promises to be as inviting as it is cool. Whether sipping a hot beverage at a cozy caf\u00e9 or enjoying a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s parks, today\u2019s conditions present a perfect canvas for a calm yet inspired afternoon in this iconic locale, where every breeze carries the promise of adventure.",
