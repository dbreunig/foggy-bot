    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a gentle sun casts its warm light upon the city, providing a brief reprieve from the morning chill. The breeze, a companion of the west-southwest wind, delivers a refreshing kiss as it swirls through the streets, lifting spirits and whispers alike. Today promises a high around a comfortable 65 degrees, dropping slightly in the afternoon, suggesting a day that is not hot nor cold, but rather a gentle embrace of pleasure. As the sun climbs, the skies remain mostly clear, devoid of the dense fog that often cloaks the city\u2019s iconic skyline. \n\nAs twilight approaches tonight, a modest layer of clouds will drift in, offering a soft curtain against the setting sun, making for a mild evening around 56 degrees. Dressing in layers is advisable; a light jacket or cardigan will shield you from the late-afternoon coolness and evening breeze. Perhaps take to the quiet paths of the Marina or stroll along the Embarcadero. With the weather being refreshingly pleasant, it\u2019s a perfect time to indulge in a leisurely coffee al fresco, or simply lose oneself in a captivating novel while parks transform into serene havens.",
