    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, the city shimmers with a cool allure, wrapped in a gentle embrace of partly cloudy skies. The current temperature hovers around a mild 49 degrees, and a soft breeze meanders through the streets, whispering tales of fog and the Pacific. While the sun has retreated, the day has left behind a promise of warmth, hinting at a high near 58 for tomorrow\u2014though expect the mercury to dip slightly as the day rolls on, settling into the familiar coolness of the evening.\n\nLate afternoon may bring fleeting showers after 5 p.m., yet they are slight and unlikely to dampen the spirit of those seeking a late stroll or a cozy gathering in a caf\u00e9. The marine layer tugs at the edges, lurking softly in the distance, casting a veil over the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, inviting a sense of mystery and romance. It is a time to dress thoughtfully; a light sweater or a stylish jacket will suffice against the evening chill, complemented by comfortable shoes for wandering. With the weather leaning on the pleasant side despite the looming humidity, consider indulging in a leisurely walk through the city\u2019s lanes or perhaps a spontaneous visit to a nearby gallery or bookstore, where the warmth within contrasts beautifully with the cool evening air.",
