    "weather_report": "The skies over Downtown San Francisco are dazzlingly clear, framing the famous skyline in vibrant hues of blue. An energetic west wind stirs the air, but it carries only the crispness of a summer day, doing little to mask the warmth beneath. With temperatures having climbed near the inviting mark of 62, the afternoon offers a gentle descent into the low 60s, a fitting backdrop for those eager to embrace the holiday spirit of Independence Day. The forecast suggests an absence of the fog that often wraps the city; instead, a brilliant light floods the streets and the iconic landmarks stretch confidently towards the azure expanse.\n\nAs night approaches, expect the clear skies to linger, offering a soothing low of around 52. Dressing in layers is advisable, equipped for the warmth of midday and the cool embrace of the evening. Consider a light jacket for a stroll along the waterfront, where the soft murmur of waves against the shore mingles with the laughter of revelers. A leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 could be a lovely way to savor the day, perhaps with a refreshing iced drink in hand while watching sailboats glide across the bay. While most will be narrating their adventures from rooftops or parks, a quiet retreat to a hidden spot within the city may yield unexpected moments of tranquility amid the celebratory chaos.",
