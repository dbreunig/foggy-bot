    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle drizzle lingers in the early hours, accompanied by a shroud of clouds that muddle the skyline. The air feels soft and cool, hinting at the persistence of the marine layer that the city is known for, though it is expected to dissipate as the day progresses. By mid-morning, the drizzle should cede to partial sunshine, teasing glimpses of warmth that linger in the air. Those venturing outside may find the cool, brisk winds swaying through the streets, an invitation for light layers, perhaps a cardigan paired with a comfortable t-shirt underneath.\n\nAs the day unfolds toward afternoon, the temperature will meander down slightly, a gentle reminder of the ever-present fog looming beyond the hills. However, the forecast promises a pleasant atmosphere; ideal for casual strolls through the quiet neighborhoods or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the serene hum of morning conversations. With weather like this, the chance to experience the city in its understated beauty is a chance not to be missed, as even the most routine activity can feel like an escape into a hidden world.",
