    "weather_report": "In the still of the night, Downtown San Francisco embraces a cloak of clouds, with the temperature resting comfortably around 57 degrees. A gentle southwest breeze, although modest, carries the promise of a new day as it swirls through the streets, hinting at the warmth to come. As the morning unfolds, the fog shifts, seemingly releasing its grip on the familiar landmarks, allowing for a kaleidoscope of sunlight to bathe the city. Expect a serene day, where the sun will peek through the remaining clouds, painting the skies a soft blue as the high inches closer to a mild 65. \n\nYet, as the daylight lingers, one may notice hints of the ever-present marine layer, particularly near the Golden Gate, where it seems to dance just out of reach. In this gentle embrace of summertime weather, light layers would serve well. Perhaps a light jacket or a cozy sweater will suffice for the earlier hours, only to be shed as the day progresses and the warmth beckons. A stroll along the Embarcadero could be particularly delightful, with the bay breeze accompanying a simple cup of coffee in hand. Picture yourself wandering through the Ferry Building Marketplace, savoring the aroma of fresh pastries and artisanal goods, perfectly in tune with the city\u2019s relaxed yet vibrant rhythm.",
