    "weather_report": "As night gently drapes its velvet cloak over Downtown San Francisco, the horizon is still kissed by a soft layer of clouds, reminiscent of the lingering whispers of a coastal breeze. The temperature rests comfortably around fifty-three degrees, inviting the occasional west wind that dances at a modest pace, bringing with it the fresh notes of the ocean. This ephemeral presence hints at a lingering marine layer, characteristic of San Francisco's nocturnal embrace, promising a hazy dawn before the sun breaks through.\n\nWith the morning light heralding Memorial Day, expect the clouds to part like a curtain revealing a vibrant stage. A sunny disposition will greet the city, offering a high of sixty-two degrees as the day unfolds, accompanied by a brisker west wind that might add an invigorating chill to the air as it gusts up to twenty-two miles per hour. Consider a light sweater or a windbreaker for the morning wanderings, perhaps paired with your favorite denim or relaxed trousers\u2014comfort is key on these wandering adventures. As you meander through the city, why not savor a quiet moment in one of the city's many parks, take in the beautiful views often obscured by fog, or find a cozy cafe to sip on a warm drink while watching the world wake up? Let the uniqueness of this coastal city envelop you, as you discover the simple pleasures hidden within its vibrant streets.",
