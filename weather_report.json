    "weather_report": "As twilight descends on Downtown San Francisco, the air exudes a gentle warmth, a prelude to the pleasant day that awaits. Tonight, the skies are partly cloudy, with a low temperature lingering around a crisp 55 degrees. The edges of the clouds dance lazily against the backdrop of the evening sky, with a soft southwest wind whispering through the streets at a mild 8 to 15 mph. If you're stepping out, a light jacket would be ideal to fend off any evening chill, particularly if you're meandering along the waterfront where the cool breeze may kiss a little more fiercely.\n\nAs you look ahead to Friday, anticipate a glorious shift towards sunshine. The high will flirt with a comfortable 70 degrees, though it may retreat to about 67 by afternoon. Winds will swell slightly, carrying hints of salt and the promise of adventure with gusts reaching 22 mph. You might consider wearing layers that allow for both sunlit warmth and occasional breezy coolness as the day unfolds. The marine layer, often a whimsical visitor in these parts, seems to make a subtle exit, leaving behind clarity that invites exploration. Stroll through the vibrant streets of the Mission or perhaps lose yourself in the greenery of Golden Gate Park, where the sunlight filters through the trees, casting playful shadows. A day enveloped in warmth and invigorating breezes beckons you to embrace the pulse of city life\u2014be it a leisurely coffee at a favorite corner caf\u00e9 or an afternoon spent indulging in the art and culture that thrives here.",
