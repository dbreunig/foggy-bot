    "weather_report": "In the quiet of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco rests beneath a veil of clouds, with the air carrying a hint of moisture, suggesting the possibility of drizzle later on. Though the darkness still clings to the streets, the promise of a slightly brighter day looms ahead. As the sun rises, it will pierce through those clouds, revealing a landscape painted in muted tones, where the cool breeze whispers through the streets, inviting a gentle stroll. The high for the day may hover around a comfortable 64, dipping slightly in the afternoon, allowing the city to breathe in the crispness of spring.\n\nWith this mix of cloudy skies and fleeting sunshine, dressing in layers would be prudent; a light jacket will serve well against the morning chill, while a breathable shirt underneath accommodates the warmth to come. As the day unfolds, the visibility may bring the distant outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and beyond into sharper focus, though the marine layer could linger, softening the edges of the views. For the discerning wanderer, this is an excellent day to savor the local coffee shops, lingering in a cozy corner with a book, or embarking on a leisurely walk along the waterfront, watching as the city awakens.",
