    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun plays coy behind a curtain of drifting clouds, creating a canvas of soft blue hues softened by wisps of white. The afternoon air hangs delightful, with a gentle warmth spilling over the streets as temperatures hover near a comfortable 67 degrees. The wind carries a lively breath from the west-southwest, promising to refresh any humid edges that cling to the day. Drifting over the Golden Gate, it dances with hints of cooler sea breezes, but for now, that marine layer remains at bay\u2014offering just the right amount of clarity to reveal the city\u2019s iconic silhouette.\n\nAs evening descends, expect the clouds to gather, wrapping the sky in a tender shroud. The air will cool to a welcoming 57 degrees, inviting a light jacket or cardigan against the fading warmth. As the backdrop shifts to a more muted palette, consider a late stroll along the waterfront to bask in the tranquil transition to night, perhaps stopping for an easy dinner at a nearby caf\u00e9 where you can enjoy the lingering essence of the day. Whether it\u2019s a book in hand or the sound of distant laughter from a neighboring table, the atmosphere promises a contemplative end to a pleasantly overcast afternoon.",
