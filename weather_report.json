    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night has settled in with a gentle rain, the skies mostly draped in clouds that carry a weight of anticipation. It's a low-lit scene, with the chill suggesting an evening spent indoors, perhaps warmed by the satisfaction of a good book or the allure of a crafted beverage. As darkness gives way to dawn's slow arrival, the temperature hovers just above fifty, accompanied by a brisk west-southwest wind that carries the taste of the ocean, hinting at the fresh spirit of the city.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, the rain will likely continue its gentle patter, a reminder of the Pacific's embrace. A forecast of partly sunny skies offers a promise of clarity, yet the clouds linger with a stubbornness typical of coastal treasures. The day is expected to climb only a modest few degrees from the morning's cool, leaving a crispness in the air that begs for a light jacket or a cozy sweater. Those venturing out would do well to consider a stroll through the quieter streets, where the early light reflects against wet pavement, inviting moments of solitude amid the occasional hustle of the city. A visit to a tucked-away caf\u00e9, with its warm offerings and enriching aromas, may just be the perfect antidote to the rain, allowing one to savor the unfolding day gently and gracefully.",
