    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity fills the air, the remnants of sunlight casting a soft golden glow against the silhouettes of the skyline. The current temperature hovers in the low fifties, accompanied by a brisk west wind, rustling through the streets and offering a refreshing touch to the warm day that has just slipped into night. With the skies largely clear and free from fog, the Golden Gate Bridge stands proud against the horizon, a magnificent sight against the backdrop of a deepening twilight.\n\nTomorrow promises a delightful day, with a sunny disposition expected to grace the city. As the temperature peaks around sixty-two, a steady breeze will be present, keeping the air invigorating yet ensuring warmth during the midday sun. It's wise to dress in layers this evening; a light jacket paired with a comfortable sweater will serve well against the evening chill, while tomorrow, light attire with a wrap for the breeze will balance comfort and style. With such inviting conditions, one might enjoy a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or lose oneself in the charming streets of the Mission, perhaps stopping by a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink. The city awaits, ready to be explored in its serene splendor.",
