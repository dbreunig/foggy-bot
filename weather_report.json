    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, wisps of fog are beginning to creep in, lending a shroud of mystery to the illuminated cityscape. The air is cool, with a gentle breeze that whispers through the streets, making for a pleasant night, albeit one that invites cozy layers. Expect a low of around 53 tonight, with patchy fog teasing at the edges of visibility after midnight, softening the city's outlines while wrapping its landmarks in a silken embrace.\n\nCome Monday, the fog will linger in the morning hours, but it\u2019s poised to lift, revealing a sky mostly shrouded in clouds as temperatures hover in the low sixties. The day will have a certain melancholic beauty to it; while the marine layer might block the sun, it will also create a unique ambiance, ideal for a leisurely stroll through the quieter corners of the city or a reflective moment at a chic caf\u00e9. Light layers should suffice to counter the coolness of the breeze and the marine influence. As night falls, consider a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the city lights twinkle against the backdrop of the bay, ensuring the evening remains one to remember.",
