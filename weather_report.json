    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere carries a mood of quiet anticipation as a mostly cloudy sky drapes itself over the city. With temperatures dipping to a cool 46 degrees, the breeze from the northeast whispers softly, offering a refreshing touch to the air. As the night deepens, the gentle darkness envelops the landscape, promising a serene backdrop for those inclined to take a moment in the outdoors or curl up in a cozy nook with a good book.\n\nAs dawn breaks, Monday will unfurl into a sun-drenched day. Expect the golden rays to gradually warm the area, hitting their peak at around 59 degrees, before settling slightly cooler as the afternoon closes in. The gentle northwestern winds will liven the atmosphere, encouraging thoughts of expeditions to the waterfront or leisurely strolls through the vibrant streets adorned with local art. Layering is advisable; a light sweater or jacket will provide comfort against the chill, especially as the sun begins its lazy descent. Engage in a quiet morning at a favorite caf\u00e9 or venture to the park to relish the unfolding day\u2019s beauty, for San Francisco's charming energy always promises moments of inspiration amid its character-rich streets.",
