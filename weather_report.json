    "weather_report": "The air above Downtown San Francisco rests gently, wrapped in a mostly clear blanket that promises a pleasant start to the week. You may sense the cool whisper of the breeze, barely stirring at two miles per hour, brushing softly against the skin. As the sun begins to rise, the temperature will glide toward a comfortable seventy degrees, though by afternoon it may settle back to a refreshing sixty-five, creating an inviting atmosphere for outdoor pursuits. \n\nIn this serene setting, the cityscape reveals itself, unhindered by fog or the inconvenient tendrils of a marine layer\u2014at least for now. The promise of an unclouded sky invites you to breathe in the crisp morning air and step outside. Consider donning light layers; a simple long-sleeve shirt should suffice, with perhaps a light jacket to ward off the lingering chill of early spring. This is a day for quiet strolls along the waterfront, a leisurely coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, or even a visit to Golden Gate Park, where the blooming flowers will surely beckon from every angle. As the sun arcs higher, the transitions in temperature call you to embrace the day\u2014a dance of warmth and coolness that reflects the easygoing spirit of this vibrant city.",
