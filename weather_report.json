    "weather_report": "As dawn settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a hint of moisture, giving a slight nod to the promise of drizzle through the night. The clouds, a muted gray swath across the sky, offer a gentle embrace, though the day will yield to bursts of sunlight, pushing through the veil of uncertainty. With temperatures resting around a crisp 54 degrees, the west-southwest winds tug playfully at your collar, reminding you that layers are your friend today. \n\nAs you step out into the bustling streets, a touch of fog clings lightly to the landscape, particularly in the quieter corners near the water, where the marine layer unfurls its delicate tendrils. The forecast hints at a 20% chance of those elusive raindrops before the clock strikes eleven, but the sun soon breaks through, ushering in a pleasant afternoon where warmth hovers near 64. It\u2019s an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps visiting an artisan market or an inviting caf\u00e9 nested on a sunlit corner. So bundle up lightly, embrace the shifting scenery, and let the day unfold its charming, albeit unpredictable, character.",
