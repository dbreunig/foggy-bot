    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentler light reveals a day brimming with promise. The skies are painted a soft blue, unmarred by the thick fog that often drapes itself over this coastal jewel. Instead, a thin veil of clouds gathers at the periphery of the bay, retreating to expose the stunning contours of the Golden Gate Bridge and the city's skyline, which stands proud and clear against the horizon. The air is cool and crisp, with a gentle breeze whispering through the streets, offering a refreshing embrace that invites one to wander outside and breathe deeply.\n\nThroughout the day, temperatures are expected to float around a comfortable 67 degrees, perfect for a stroll through the twisting streets or a leisurely pause at one of the many charming caf\u00e9s. As the sun dips lower in the sky, a hint of warmth will remain, and the evening promises serenity with mostly clear skies. Given these conditions, a light jacket may suffice for the cooler temperatures after dark, while layering remains the sensible approach for those venturing out in the afternoon. The allure of such a pleasant day beckons one to visit nearby parks, where the vibrant greenery provides a striking contrast to the urban landscape, or to indulge in a quiet moment on a bench, watching the world drift by beneath the softening sun.",
