    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun bathes Downtown San Francisco in a warm embrace, casting a gentle glow over the city's iconic skyline. With temperatures nudging near 67 degrees, the air remains pleasant, albeit with a slight coolness that whispers the influence of the wind. This westward breeze, dancing at around 14 mph and with occasional gusts that add a playful flutter to the scene, keeps the warmth in check. The clarity of the day is striking, seen in the blue vault of the sky that stretches above without a trace of fog. \n\nAs evening approaches, the transition promises a serene shift; cloudy remnants will drift in, resting around a low of 56 degrees. In this mild weather, a light jacket or a comfortable sweater offers the ideal balance against the cooling air. This picturesque day invites a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps with a stop at a nearby caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, allowing the evening's gentle embrace to unfold in quiet anticipation. With the sun dipping low in the horizon, the city holds a peaceful charm, ideal for unwinding while appreciating the allure that is distinctly San Francisco.",
