    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun bathes the city in a gentle light, breaking through to reveal a serene and mostly clear sky. Current temperatures are right around the mid-sixties, making for a comfortably mild afternoon that invites you outdoors. The winds are brisk, stirring up a playful atmosphere as they dance between the buildings. Clouds drift lazily above, casting fleeting shadows but failing to obscure the bright day; there is little sign of fog or straying marine layers typical of this coastal locale.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect the sky to remain clear with temperatures slipping to a refreshing coolness. With the breeze softening in the evening, it's an ideal time to enjoy a peaceful stroll down the waterfront or to relish a cozy dinner at one of the local eateries. Given the delightful conditions, consider layering with a light jacket or sweater, perfect for transitioning from the sun's warmth to the evening chill. Whether you're venturing out to admire the scenic views or simply meandering through the streets, the evening promises to be as pleasant as the day.",
