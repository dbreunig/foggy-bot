    "weather_report": "In the embrace of a mostly cloudy afternoon, Downtown San Francisco stands under a soft, muted light. A gentle wind, whispering from the west southwest, stirs the air\u2014inviting rather than intrusive, cloaked in the coolness of the bay\u2019s breath. The warmth barely kisses 63 degrees, creating an atmosphere that invites layers rather than shorts. The skyline, though enveloped in cloud, possesses a certain charm, a depth shrouded in the coastal marine layer that hints at the Pacific just beyond. Fog paints the distant north, offering only glimpses of the Golden Gate Bridge, while downtown remains anchored in a grayish canvas that soothes the senses.\n\nAs evening beckons, the clouds may not relent, with temperatures dipping to a mild 56, encouraging walks under the urban glow. Dress in light layers: a comfortable sweater or jacket will be your companion as the wind picks up its pace. Treasures await this evening\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, the cool air punctuated by laughter floating from nearby caf\u00e9s. Or maybe a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many parks, the soft rustle of leaves a calming backdrop. While the fog dances around the city, it holds within its embrace the promise of pleasant encounters and unexpected discoveries.",
