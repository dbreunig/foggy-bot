    "weather_report": "As daylight wanes over Downtown San Francisco, the scene is painted in sharp contrasts between the clarity of the afternoon and the impending arrival of rain. Currently, the sun graces the city, illuminating the golden hues lingering against a backdrop of cobalt skies. The temperature hovers in the low fifties, reflecting the briskness often characteristic of this coastal town. Anticipation hangs in the air, for as night approaches, the forecast promises a complete transformation; clouds will draw together, and rain will commence just after eleven, leaving a shimmering trace of rainfall that could register between a quarter and half an inch.\n\nThough the sun is still shining, it teases the senses with hints of chill borne on winds gusting from the West, weaving through the streets and inviting layers to keep warm. The marine layer, ever-present yet dormant for now, may soon cloak the golden panorama as the day yields to the embrace of moisture-laden skies. For those navigating the downtown streets, a light jacket and sturdy footwear would serve well, preparing one for both the brilliant sunlight and the promise of evening's downpour. As the sun dips, consider a stroll through the city's eclectic neighborhoods, where caf\u00e9s bustle and warm aromas beckon, offering the perfect prelude to a cozy night indoors as storm clouds gather on the horizon.",
