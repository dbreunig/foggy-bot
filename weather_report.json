    "weather_report": "As midnight blankets Downtown San Francisco, the air is thick with anticipation of the rain that is inevitably on the horizon. Overhead, an ominous quilt of clouds shrouds the city, thickening as the hours progress. The south winds howl, carrying with them the scent of impending storms. Already, you can sense the moisture that will soon descend, draping the streets in glistening layers of rain. Tonight's forecast promises a relentless downpour, with thunderstorms adding a dramatic backdrop to the city's usually vibrant nightlife. \n\nAs dawn approaches, Wednesday will usher in a day marked by lingering showers, casting a shadow over San Francisco's typically picturesque skyline. Expect the high temperature to hover near 63, but as the clouds loom, the chill is certain to weave its way through the streets, suggesting layers are a wise choice. A comfortable raincoat paired with sturdy shoes will serve you well against puddled sidewalks. Given these wet and blustery conditions, a day indoors might be more appealing\u2014consider curling up in a cozy caf\u00e9 with a warm drink, or perhaps visiting one of the many galleries that breathe life into the city's culture. Under these atmospheric conditions, the heartbeat of the city slows down a bit, inviting moments of introspection and comfort as you listen to the rhythm of rain against windowpanes.",
