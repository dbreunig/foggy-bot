    "weather_report": "As night cloaks Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere bears an unmistakable air of tranquility. Tonight's cloud cover has muted the otherwise vibrant city lights, presenting a canvas of soft shadows punctuated by the occasional twinkle of illumination. The temperature gently cradles around 51 degrees, with a mild west wind lightly rustling through the streets, adding a fresh sprinkle of moisture to the air. The marine layer seems to be rolling in, wrapping the iconic skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge in a shroud of mystery, though it is not insistent this time\u2014no foghorns reverberate through the night\u2014just a subtle, cool embrace that invites one to linger outside.\n\nAs the dawn approaches, expect the sun to break through the layers of clouds, heralding a pleasant day ahead. Tuesday promises a shift in mood, beckoning with sunshine and a high temperature near 62 degrees. This transformation invites you to don layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket to ward off morning chill, giving way to a comfortably casual t-shirt as the day warms. Consider a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the blend of waterfront views and fresh air rejuvenates the spirit, or perhaps enjoy a leisurely brunch at a local caf\u00e9, watching the world awaken. With such inviting conditions, the day is yours to explore\u2014gently nudging you toward simple pleasures amidst the charm of a waking city.",
