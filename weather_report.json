    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun bathes the streets with a golden warmth, promising a high of around 75 degrees before the afternoon cools it slightly to a gentle embrace of 73. The brisk northwest winds stir up a refreshing breeze, complementing the clarity that characterizes this delightful morning. There are no signs of fog to mar the stunning views stretching towards the Golden Gate; instead, the sky is a vibrant blue, welcoming the day with an open heart.\n\nAs the evening approaches, a calm transition into cooler temperatures is expected, dipping to 54 degrees under a mostly clear sky. It would be wise to dress in layers, perhaps a light sweater for later in the day or a light jacket for those wandering out after sunset. The weather beckons one to indulge in simple pleasures\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park, savoring a warm cup of coffee from a quaint caf\u00e9, or simply unwinding on a bench, soaking in the tranquility of the outdoors as day edges into dusk.",
