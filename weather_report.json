    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, this afternoon unfolds with a clarity that seems to invigorate the very air around you. A bright sun casts a warm glow, despite the high hovering around 64 degrees, soon to drift to a cooler 62 as the day wanes. The vibrant blue above contrasts beautifully with the lively movement of the west wind, which sweeps through the streets with a gusty spirit. While there\u2019s a sprinkling of clouds, the promise of sun prevails, and the faint outlines of distant hills remain visible, suggesting that the infamous fog is either holding back or keeping a respectful distance from today\u2019s vibrant canvas.\n\nAs the evening approaches, temperatures will settle around 54 degrees, and although the clouds may gather, they won't entirely obscure the twilight hues that dance upon the horizon. A light southwest wind continues to weave through the city, elevating the atmosphere with a cool breeziness, perfect for a leisurely stroll. Given these conditions, a light jacket layered over a comfortable shirt would suit the occasion well. Perhaps you might wander down to one of the city\u2019s promenades, indulging in a warm beverage as the sky deepens into evening\u2014a simple yet enchanting way to savor the shifting moods of the day.",
