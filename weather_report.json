    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a canvas of mostly sunny skies ushers in the day, accompanied by a gentle breeze from the west-southwest. The weather feels inviting, yet carries that characteristic hint of the city\u2019s maritime influence, an assurance that even in clear moments, the cool air will persist. With temperatures hovering around 62 degrees, a slight drop into the low 60s is anticipated as the afternoon unfolds. For those venturing outdoors, layering becomes the art form of the day\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a crisp jacket to embrace the brisk wind that dances through the streets.\n\nWith clarity across the landscape, the golden hues of the morning sun gleam against the city's iconic architecture, inviting a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely exploration of the local cafes\u2014ideal for sipping a warm beverage while savoring moments as they pass. The presence of fog continues to linger at the edges, teasing the cliffs around the Golden Gate, yet today it remains a delicate whisper rather than an overwhelming presence. As the day progresses into the evening, a touch of cloudiness will settle in, but the charm of San Francisco\u2019s dynamic skyline remains intact, suggesting an evening walk could still hold enchantment amidst the enveloping calm.",
