    "weather_report": "In the stillness of night, San Francisco rests under a blanket of partly cloudy skies, the air crisp with a gentle breeze whispering through the streets. The temperature hovers around the coolness of 50 degrees, inviting those awake to wrap themselves in layers, perhaps a light jacket or a soft sweater to fend off the chill. As dawn approaches, the city will awaken to a brilliant sunshine that promises to grace the day. By midday, a serene warmth will envelop the Bay, peaking near 63 degrees before a subtle cooling off to 61 as afternoon slips in.\n\nThis morning, the skyline may be somewhat muted, but the clarity is on the rise, with fog retreating and only wisps of marine layer lingering along the edges. A soft west wind will weave through the city at a gentle pace, offering a refreshing sense of movement, and should any fog dare to appear, it is likely to hug the coast, providing a picturesque contrast against the bright blue skies overhead. Dress smartly for the day: light layers will serve well as the sun rises and the temperature slowly climbs, allowing for comfort while staying stylish. \n\nFor this lovely Tuesday, a stroll down to one of the welcoming waterfront caf\u00e9s beckons, a perfect opportunity to savor a warm cup of coffee while the city awakens around you. Observing the boats glide by, or perhaps heading to a local bookstore to shelter in the warmth of stories as the sun pours in\u2014all simple pleasures that this enchanting city offers on such a promising day.",
