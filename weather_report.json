    "weather_report": "The air in Downtown San Francisco hangs with a gentle clarity, the city basking under a predominantly sunny sky. As the afternoon winds down, temperatures approach a comfortable 65 degrees, though you might feel a noticeable coolness settling in, particularly as the golden hour approaches. The faintest wisp of fog lingers on the edges of the bay, hinting at the persistent marine layer that often dances with the land and sea. The west winds, whispering at around 7 mph, add a refreshing chill, suggesting that while the day is pleasant, it is wise to prepare for a slight drop in temperature as twilight descends.\n\nAs night falls, the clouds will drift lazily, clustering into partially obscured skies while temperatures dip to around 50 degrees. This is a perfect evening for strolling through city streets or perusing local bookstores, perhaps dressed in light layers\u2014a soft sweater over a casual shirt to accommodate the variable warmth and coolness of the evening air. Whether joining friends for coffee or simply savoring a quiet walk, the charm of a late February day in San Francisco invites both reflection and connection without the hustle that too often characterizes the city.",
