    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unveils a canvas painted in murky grays and silvery blues, reflecting the rain-soaked atmosphere set to envelop the city. Clouds loom heavily, promising showers and thunderstorms before the day gives way to evening. The brisk winds from the south whip through the streets, carrying a chill that seeps into your bones, making a warm, layered outfit essential. A waterproof jacket, perhaps, combined with a comfortable scarf may keep you cozy as you navigate the damp sidewalks.\n\nAs the rain dances upon the rooftops, this is no day for extravagant endeavors. Instead, it invites a slower pace, where the rhythmic splashes of water can be appreciated from the warmth of a local caf\u00e9. Curling up with a book or sharing stories over steaming mugs of tea or coffee would be a pleasant reprieve from the tempest outside. So, pause for a moment, indulge in the simple pleasures, and savor the tranquility found amidst the ongoing storm.",
