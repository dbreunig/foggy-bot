    "weather_report": "As night falls over Downtown San Francisco, the skyline is draped in a shroud of quiet clouds, suggesting a night steeped in the cool embrace of a gentle breeze from the west. The temperature whispers around 50 degrees, nudging onlookers to wrap themselves in light layers, perhaps a soft sweater or a chic jacket to shield against any sudden chill. Tomorrow promises a transition, as the morning sun dances in, banishing the gloom to reveal a mostly sunny day, where temperatures may rise to a comfortable 65 degrees. A mild wind will playfully tousle hair and refresh citygoers as they stroll through park pathways or leisurely sip coffee at sidewalk caf\u00e9s.\n\nWhile it may not be the sunniest evening, there\u2019s a certain charm in the hazy curtain that oversees the city. The anticipated fog should remain a gentle presence, perhaps snuggling into the rolling hills or wrapping around the iconic towers that punctuate the skyline. For those who favor tranquility, a quiet walk along the waterfront or an evening spent at a cozy bookstore might serve well, while others might find inspiration in inviting friends over for intimate conversations, warmth, and the glow of streetlights reflecting off damp pavement.",
