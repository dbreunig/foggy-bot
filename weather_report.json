    "weather_report": "As the city sleeps under a blanket of clear skies, the morning in Downtown San Francisco promises serenity, with a gentle breeze wafting through its streets. Currently, the temperature is comfortably mild, hovering around a pleasant 57 degrees. The nighttime air feels crisp, inviting those awake to breathe deeply and relish the minimal disruption from the usual fog, allowing for a clear view of the stars. \n\nThe sun will soon rise to grace the day with warmth and brightness, casting golden rays across the city and nudging the temperature towards a cheerful 73 degrees by afternoon. With the day expected to be sunny and breezy, a soft west-southwest wind will quicken, providing just enough movement to keep the air fresh and invigorating. Dress in layers; a light jacket may be a companion for early morning strolls before shedding it as the sun climbs higher. Today's ideal activities might include a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the piers beckon with their aquatic charm. Alternatively, venturing to a local caf\u00e9 for a quiet morning brew could lead to inspiring conversations with early risers, all against the backdrop of a city slowly waking, shimmering in the sun's embrace.",
