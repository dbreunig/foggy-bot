    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a welcoming embrace of sunshine, tempering the vibrancy of the city with a gentle breeze. As the clock ticks closer to evening, the temperature hovers around 65 degrees, accompanied by a westerly wind whispering through the streets at 14 miles per hour. The clarity above reveals an enchanting blue sky, unmarred by the encroachment of fog\u2014though a subtle marine layer still lingers at the edges, hinting at the region's ever-present relationship with the ocean.\n\nAs the sun dips lower, the evening promises a soft transition into partly cloudy skies, casting a serene mood over the city. With a nightfall temperature settling around 56 degrees, a light jacket or sweater will serve as your companion against the cool breeze, inviting you to savor the charms of an early August evening. Stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps, where the lights begin to twinkle against the darkening sky, or find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, sipping a warm drink while watching the world pass by. The day calls for simplicity, embracing the mild splendor that is uniquely San Francisco.",
