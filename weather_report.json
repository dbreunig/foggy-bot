    "weather_report": "As the city of San Francisco surrenders to the night\u2019s embrace, a blanket of clouds whispers promises of a gentle morning. The temperature lingers around a mild 52 degrees, accompanied by the soft caress of a light breeze from the north northeast, hinting at the calming lull of the ocean's breath. On Friday, expect a shift as the sun breaks through, inviting a mix of sun and cloud to dance against the backdrop of our iconic skyline. With the temperature reaching a welcoming 65 degrees before settling back to the coolness of afternoon, the day will gracefully unfold like a well-loved novel.\n\nWhile the fog is kept at bay for now, the marine layer may ripple along the edges of the Golden Gate, a reserved presence ready to curl into sight as the sun demands its stage. For today, dress in layers to savor the fluctuating warmth and reprieve; a light jacket will suffice against the remnants of evening chill. Consider a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the waves will share tales from the bay, or perhaps a coffee at one of the local cafes overlooking the harbor. This is a day for quiet reflections amidst the vibrant pulse of city life, sipping thoughts into the air like the gentle morning mist that lingers just out of reach.",
