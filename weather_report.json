    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night wraps its cool arms around the city, ushering in a delicate sprinkle of drizzle. The sky, clad in a thick quilt of clouds, holds the promise of a slightly warmer day ahead. As dawn approaches, the current chill in the air\u2014a gentle 54 degrees\u2014stirs a whisper of fog, a reminder of the ocean's lingering touch. Winds from the southwest carry a mild breath, moving at about 7 mph, erasing the stillness that often envelops the early hours.\n\nAs Tuesday unfolds, the sun will gradually peel away the mist, revealing a mostly sunny disposition by midday. At a high near 63, the day will invite layers; a light jacket paired with a soft sweater would suit the coolness best, especially as temperatures dip into a soft embrace in the afternoon, settling around 61. As you wander through the streets, perhaps seeking the inviting corners of a caf\u00e9 or the understated allure of a local bookstore, the light breezes will playfully tug at your hair, while whispers of the golden bridges and undulating hills beckon for exploration. This early summer day starts crisp, but with promise\u2014perfect for a leisurely stroll or a simple moment of reflection, possibly at a favorite window seat, coffee warming your palms as you take in the shifting landscape.",
