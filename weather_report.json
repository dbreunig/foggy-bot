    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun graces Downtown San Francisco with a gentle warmth, casting long shadows against a backdrop of crystalline blue skies. The temperature hovers near a comfortable sixty-seven degrees, a perfect invitation for a stroll through the heart of the city, where the buzz of life intertwines with bursts of spring\u2019s vibrancy. As the hours wane, the air may cool slightly, settling into a tranquil sixty-five, kissed by a soft west wind that whispers promises of evening calm.\n\nWith no substantial fog to obscure the view, the Golden Gate Bridge stands proudly against its enveloping hills, offering a sight that elicits awe. Tonight, the stars will begin to peek through as the skies clear, inviting those who venture out to enjoy the crispness that envelopes a low of around fifty-one. It's a night perfectly suited for layering\u2014a light sweater or jacket over casual attire, perhaps paired with comfortable shoes to navigate the welcoming streets. As the day\u2019s glow gives way to the evening\u2019s embrace, consider a leisurely walk along the waterfront or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the delights of the day linger in the air, promising yet another enchanting San Francisco evening.",
