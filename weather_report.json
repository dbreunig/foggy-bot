    "weather_report": "As night drapes San Francisco in its serene embrace, the air remains refreshingly crisp with a slight breeze whispering from the south. A low temperature settling at about fifty-one offers an invitation to cozy layers, perhaps a light jacket or a soft sweater, perfect for strolls along the waterfront, where the shadows of iconic landmarks cast long against the shimmering bay. The forecast for Monday promises a delightful awakening, as the sun graces the city with warmth near seventy-six, ushering in a splendid day likely devoid of fog. \n\nIn the morning light, expect the golden sun to awaken the city from its slumber, revealing the contours of neighborhoods layered in brightness, the clarity of the day drawing out outdoor enthusiasts to parks or coffee shops with al fresco seating. It\u2019s a time for exploration, whether that be a quiet walk through the Presidio, the discovery of new flavors at a tucked-away caf\u00e9, or tapping into the local art scene. These conditions unfold a beautiful tableau, encouraging you to cast aside the constraints of the indoors and embrace the potential of a vibrant day ahead.",
