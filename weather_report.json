    "weather_report": "The morning unfurls like a canvas across Downtown San Francisco, revealing a gentle clarity interrupted only by whispers of distant clouds, hinting at the sea\u2019s embrace beyond. The sun, while modest in its ascent, casts a soft glow that dances across the streets, ensuring that today feels alive and invigorating. Temperatures are poised to drop slightly as the day progresses, yet the warmth of the morning might encourage a leisurely stroll through the neighborhoods, where the essence of the city lingers in the air.\n\nAs evening approaches, a subtle coolness will envelop the city, a reminder of the Pacific's influence that can stir the fog into being. With temperatures dipping into the forties, layers will become your ally; a light jacket or scarf can provide comfort as you venture out. Perhaps it is a night for sipping coffee in a cozy cafe, or wandering the softer streets toward the harbor, where the twinkling lights reflect upon the water like memories waiting to be discovered. Today presents a delightful opportunity to savor the unique charm of San Francisco, all while wrapped in the comforting embrace of the city's ever-changing weather.",
