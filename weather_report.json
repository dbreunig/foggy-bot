    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the air is cool and tinged with the faint aroma of the sea, while a cloak of patchy fog drapes lazily across the bay. At this early hour, the cityscape is shrouded in a delicate veil of cloud, hinting at the sun's imminent arrival. Soft strokes of paler light begin to tease their way through the fog, promising a day that will blossom into warmth. Though the day is expected to unfold into mostly sunny skies, early risers may still find themselves accompanied by the drifting mist, particularly around the Golden Gate and the waterfront, where the marine layer often lingers.\n\nAs temperatures rise to a gentle 66 degrees, layering is key; a light jacket will suffice for those stepping out into the morning haze, while a simple short-sleeved shirt will keep you comfortable in the afternoon sun. With conditions set to clear, today beckons for leisurely strolls along Fisherman's Wharf or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the tranquil parks. The early fog makes it a perfect time to sip a warm coffee while savoring the calm before the city stirs fully awake. So, whether you seek solace among the fog or revel in the golden light of day, San Francisco\u2019s varied beauty invites you to embrace the possibilities of its shifting skies.",
