    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a soft veil of partly cloudy skies blankets the city, allowing the cool air to whisper of the evening's chill, which will settle around 48 degrees. A gentle breeze from the west southwest brings with it a comforting stillness, hinting at a tranquil night ahead. Tomorrow promises to unfurl under mostly sunny conditions, inviting soft warmth that nudges the temperature up to a pleasant 64, slowly retreating to a comfortable 62 as the day softly wanes. The clarity of the skyline\u2014punctuated by the silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge against the distant hills\u2014speaks to the lingering marine layer, now receding but still present on the fringes, casting a delicate touch over the Bay.\n\nFor the evening, a light jacket would be wise, worn over a comfortable layer as one might venture out for a stroll along the waterfront, perhaps stopping for a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 while the city begins to twinkle with nighttime energy. In the morning, as the sun rises, it would be delightful to embrace the day on foot or bike, allowing the mild day to unfold, perfect for a visit to one of the nearby parks or a marketplace buzzing with the promise of spring. The weather invites exploration, urging you to linger just a little longer beneath the open sky.",
