As morning unfolds, a series of showers and the rumbles of distant thunder may punctuate the cool air, inviting anticipation for the stormy symphony that nature orchestrates. Expect a high to hover around a cool 56 degrees, with gusty winds sweeping through the streets, lending a brisk edge to the atmosphere. The chance of rain hangs tangibly in the air, creating an ambiance both invigorating and a tad foreboding. \n\nAs evening approaches, clarity will return, with the skies clearing to reveal a more serene panorama, though a slight chill will linger, demanding layers for evening wanderers. A light jacket, perhaps paired with a sturdy umbrella for the persistent drizzles, will ensure coziness against the cool northwest winds. It\u2019s a day splendid for nurturing the spirit indoors\u2014think warm cup of tea alongside a good book or visiting a local caf\u00e9 to savor quiet moments against the backdrop of soft rains outside. For those braving the elements, a walk might offer a refreshing encounter with a dramatically moody skyline and the sweet scent of wet pavement mingling with the cool breeze.",
