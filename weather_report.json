    "weather_report": "As the night deepens in Downtown San Francisco, a mild embrace of cloud covers the city, temperatures gently cradling around 52 degrees. The west wind whispers through the streets, a steady companion at eighteen miles per hour, occasionally whipping up gusts that dance around 23 mph. The city remains cloaked in the quiet of the night, revealing only scattered twinkles of lights below, hints of life stirring beneath the veil. Fog may still linger around the edges, softening defines and blurring the lines between land and sea.\n\nAs dawn approaches, Thursday promises to unveil a more optimistic palette across the skies, transitioning into a day where the sun will emerge significantly, painting the horizon with warmth and light, nudging the high up to a comfortable 68. While the gentle breeze continues from the west, it's likely to carry the scent of salt and adventure. A light jacket, perhaps layered over a simple shirt, will offer comfort for morning strolls and outdoor escapades. It's the perfect backdrop for indulging in an early breakfast at a local caf\u00e9, where the fresh aromas of coffee meld with the cool morning air, or taking a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, the waters of the bay shimmering under the joyful embrace of the sun, inviting one for a day of discovery amidst the city's historic haunts and lively streets.",
