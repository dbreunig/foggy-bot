    "weather_report": "This afternoon, Downtown San Francisco basks under a generous sun, gleaming off the city's architectural marvels and unfolding an inviting tableau. The temperatures gently drift to the low sixties, fostering a comfortable warmth that begs for a casual stroll or an unhurried cafe visit in the surrounding neighborhoods. A playful west wind whips through the streets at a lively pace, adding a refreshing bite that might warrant a light sweater or cardigan as the sun begins its descent into the evening.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the night will settle softly with partially cloudy skies and a gentle embrace of cool air, dropping to the low fifties. The wind will continue its playful dance, ushering in a serene ambiance perfect for an evening walk along the waterfront or a quiet gathering among friends. With the clarity of the day and no fog to speak of, the iconic views from Twin Peaks or even a breezy pier visit would make for a delightful way to savor the remnants of a sunny day. Tread softly but surely, and relish the simple pleasures that this splendid urban landscape has to offer.",
