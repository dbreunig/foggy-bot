    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the weather embraces a gentle warmth as evening shadows stretch across the cityscape. A mild afternoon gives way to a partly cloudy night, with whispers of wind weaving through the streets at about 14 mph, occasionally gusting to 20 mph. The air feels crisp, almost invigorating, carrying with it the subtle scent of the bay. While the horizon remains clear for many, it hints at a potential marine layer nearby, urging those who enjoy the outdoors to find pockets of sunshine while they can.\n\nAs darkness approaches, current temperatures hover comfortably around 52 degrees, allowing for a light jacket or sweater to accompany evening strolls. Those inclined toward a leisurely outing might consider a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 or a quiet walk along the waterfront, where the gentle ripples of the bay shimmer under the twilight. Tonight beckons tranquil moments, perfect for savoring a good book or enjoying soft conversation with a friend, all under the softly glimmering city lights.",
