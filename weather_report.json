    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, a soft blanket of clouds drapes over the city, whispering coolness in the gentle breeze from the west. As evening sets in, the temperature settles comfortably around 54 degrees, inviting a light jacket or cozy sweater to ward off the chill. The wind, a quiet companion at about 8 mph, rustles the leaves and stirs the crisp air, creating a serene atmosphere perfect for an evening stroll along the shore or through the pleasantly lit streets.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, Friday greets us with a promise of partly sunny skies. The day will unfold with temperatures nudging towards 64 degrees before tapering to 62 in the afternoon, suggesting a very pleasant midday warmth perfect for a leisurely lunch outdoors or a leisurely visit to one of the city's vibrant parks. However, expect the comforting presence of the west wind, ranging from gentle to breezy, occasionally flirting with gusts that may momentarily stir the air, so layering becomes essential. As the marine layer lifts, the ever-familiar fog may cling stubbornly to the horizon, accentuating the city\u2019s iconic silhouette. It\u2019s a fine day for the quiet joys\u2014perhaps a slow coffee in a sunlit caf\u00e9 or a tranquil visit to a local gallery, as the evolving weather beckons you to find solace amidst the changing scenery.",
