    "weather_report": "In the early hours, Downtown San Francisco awakens beneath a bright and welcoming sun, casting its warm glow over the city. Clear skies stretch above, devoid of the usual fog that often blankets this coastal gem, allowing for unobstructed views toward the Golden Gate and the rolling hills beyond. The air carries a gentle breeze from the northwest, a refreshing companion as temperatures gradually rise to a comfortable warmth.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect to see the thermometer settling around the mid-seventies, inviting residents and visitors alike to step outside and bask in the serene atmosphere. A light jacket may accompany you into the afternoon, as the temperatures cool slightly, but the charm of the day lies in its clarity and soft sunshine. The evening promises a tranquil close to the day, with mostly clear skies and mild temperatures, perfect for taking leisurely strolls along the waterfront or enjoying a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9.\n\nFor those venturing out, consider a walk through one of the city\u2019s picturesque parks or a visit to an art gallery, soaking in the beauty of a day that feels distinctly uplifting. These ordinary moments transformed by the extraordinary light of San Francisco create an experience that lingers long after nightfall.",
