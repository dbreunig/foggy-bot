A low temperature of 56 degrees lingers like a soft breath, inviting a layer or two; a light jacket paired with cotton or a knit will provide the comfort one seeks against the cool touch of the evening air. As the sun stretches to greet the day, it promises a brighter canvas, with the forecast hinting at a high of approximately 67 degrees\u2014a warm embrace by late morning, tempered by an afternoon dip, a reminder of the Bay's capricious climate. \n\nWhile the marine layer may tend to hover closer to the coast, reducing visibility toward the Golden Gate, the incoming sun will soon carve away any lingering shadows, illuminating the iconic skyline. Those seeking adventure might find joy in a quiet stroll through the winding streets lined with coffee shops and vintage stores, or perhaps a leisurely bike ride along the Embarcadero, where fresh ocean breezes mix with city energy. As the winds start to pick up\u2014a soft southwest rush between 6 to 14 mph\u2014it\u2019s a day that calls for exploration, inviting locals and visitors alike to savor the nuances of a subtle, unfolding summer day in the city.",
