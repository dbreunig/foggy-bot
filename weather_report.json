    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun casts its gentle warmth over Downtown San Francisco, the skies remain strikingly clear, with hints of the city's iconic vistas. A delightful breeze from the west southwest whispers through the streets, carrying with it the slight chill of the ocean, perfect for an invigorating stroll along the waterfront. The scenic beauty of the Golden Gate Bridge glimmers under the sun's embrace, while the low-lying hills hold their steadfast presence against the bright horizon. Tonight, as the day gives way to evening, expect a soft blanket of clouds to scatter across the sky, ushering in a calm and slightly cool night.\n\nThe present charm of the day encourages casual, layered attire\u2014a light jacket paired with a comfortable shirt will do wonders to balance the day's warmth and the approaching evening chill. A walk through the vibrant Mission District or a leisurely visit to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art could enrich your day, offering a taste of the city's art and culture. Consider finishing with a warm cup of coffee, preferably at a cozy cafe that invites lingering conversations and the simple pleasure of watching the world go by.",
