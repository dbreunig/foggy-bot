As twilight descends, the temperature gently dips to a comfortable 46 degrees, with the south-southwest breeze weaving through the alleys at a leisurely pace. Tonight, the stars might play coy, tucked away behind the lingering whispers of daylight, but an overall sense of calm prevails, suggesting an ideal backdrop for a tranquil night walk or a cozy gathering over warm drinks.\n\nAs dawn unfurls tomorrow, a sunlit greeting awaits, promising a mostly clear landscape that hints at the vibrancy of the day. With highs around 62, the warmth will steadily wrap around you, though it may take a subtle dip to 58 in the afternoon\u2014a reminder of the Bay\u2019s ever-changing temperament. For those contemplating the best attire, layers will serve well; a light jacket can ward off any chill as you sip coffee at your favorite caf\u00e9 or stroll through the waterfront parks. Amid this manageable presence of fog and marine layers, it\u2019s a splendid opportunity for a stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps even indulging in impromptu people-watching or basking in the glow of the city\u2019s charm.",
