    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle drizzle brushes against the skin, a light reminder that the marine layer still holds sway over the city. The skies are partly veiled with clouds, offering a muted palette that hints at the sun\u2019s presence yet to fully break through. Currently, temperatures linger in the early sixties, with a slight drop on the horizon as the day moves forward. Winds from the southwest whisper through the streets, rustling leaves and accompanying the atmospheric dance.\n\nAs the day progresses, expect occasional or light drizzle with a 40% chance of precipitation persisting alongside mostly cloudy skies. Though the brisk conditions might feel cool, they invite a thoughtful choice of attire\u2014perhaps a light jacket layered over a breathable shirt, a nod to both comfort and the whimsical nature of San Francisco\u2019s microclimates. An afternoon stroll through the Presidio, a little caf\u00e9 visit nestled within the fog\u2019s embrace, or simply reveling in a good book near a window that captures the city\u2019s strength, cloaked in mystery, all seem like splendid options. Enjoy this gentle San Francisco day, where fog and drizzle act as a backdrop for simple yet fulfilling moments.",
