    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the air carries a certain freshness, kissed by the distant whispers of the ocean. As the sun ascends in its arc, the city basks in a mostly sunny embrace, with temperatures hovering around a pleasant 60 degrees. The clear skies are punctuated by the soft gaze of clouds that hint at potential rain come the morning light's fading. It's a day that beckons for a leisurely stroll, perhaps along Market Street or through the bustling Embarcadero, where the laughter of passersby mingles with the gentle rustle of leaves.\n\nAs the afternoon rolls in, the chill will descend slightly to around 57, a gentle reminder from San Francisco's capricious weather. With the gentle northwest wind, the invigorating breeze may call for a light sweater, ideal for those taking in the views from the Ferry Building or perhaps enjoying a cup of coffee at a cafe. Evening draws near, and while the chance of rain flirts with us after 4 PM, it's merely a whisper against the backdrop of an intriguing urban landscape\u2014hinting at cozy evenings in local eateries or engaging in quiet reflections at home, watching the city lights flicker to life.",
