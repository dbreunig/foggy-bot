    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a pristine sky, where sunshine bathes the city, nudging temperatures to a delightful 65 degrees. The westward winds sweep through with a spirited embrace, bringing with them a sense of vibrancy that invigorates the air. There is little to speak of in terms of fog; instead, what sprawls before the eye is clarity, a sharpness to the horizon that reveals the graceful arcs of the Golden Gate Bridge against the backdrop of distant hills.\n\nAs night approaches, the calm remains, with mostly clear skies ushering in cooler air and temperatures settling around 52 degrees. The west winds will gently ease, making way for a tranquil evening. Given these lovely conditions, a stroll through the city's iconic parks or along the waterfront could be the perfect way to savor the day's warmth before retreating into the evening. A light jacket might be wise as the sun dips, ensuring comfort against the slight chill that lingers. This is an afternoon to relish and an evening to embrace amidst the enchanting rhythms of the city.",
