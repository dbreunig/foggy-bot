    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in a cool, misty embrace this morning, as the sky remains cloaked in a soft shroud. The forecast speaks of rain likely before evening, hinting at a day where nature\u2019s mood swings between the somber and the hopeful. Temperatures hover around a modest 55 degrees, while gusty west winds whip through the streets, lending an energetic edge to an otherwise tranquil scene. The marine layer appears to linger not far from the shoreline, offering slight visibility into the golden embrace of the Golden Gate, yet overshadowing much of the cityscape with a persistent gray.\n\nAs the sun contemplates an appearance, it suggests a transition to partly sunny skies. Tonight, the clouds will relent, revealing a constellation of stars as the temperature cools to a seemingly crisp 44 degrees. For those venturing out today, a light jacket will suit one best, ideally layered for warmth against the brisk winds. An afternoon stroll could yield delightful surprises; perhaps a quiet moment in one of the tucked-away parks or a visit to a beloved caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with the whispers of the wind. Embrace the day's peculiar charm, for there is beauty to be found in its softness.",
