    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the night, Downtown San Francisco wraps itself in a muted embrace of clouds, hinting at the moisture that will soon kiss the pavement. The air carries a crispness, a reminder that the overnight chill might linger just long enough to catch one off guard. As the dawn approaches, the chance of rain looms, an intimate promise of a gentle, drizzling ballet unfolding after the clock strikes four. \n\nThrough the day, a semblance of the sun might peek through the overcast, though patchy fog could dance around the fringes, softening the edges of the skyline. With a high near 58, the warmth will remain elusive, coaxing many to bundle lightly, perhaps opting for a comfortable sweater or a light jacket. This could be the perfect day to wander the lanes of the Ferry Building, delighting in the local vendors\u2019 offerings, or to slip into a cozy spot with a curated selection of books, allowing the murmur of rain to provide a backdrop to quiet contemplation. As the city emerges from its hazy slumber, let the weather guide you toward inviting corners that promise warmth, both in atmosphere and in community.",
