    "weather_report": "As the city sleeps, a steady rain begins to weave through the streets of Downtown San Francisco, veiling the night in a glistening sheen. The air is imbued with that fresh, earthy scent, a true harbinger of spring\u2019s promise, as temperatures dip gently to the mid-forties. Gusts from the south carry whispers of the coastal fog, though tonight, it remains shy, leaving the sky mostly cloudy but not completely obscured. The rain, relentless yet soothing, will continue through Friday, drenching the city with a promise of rejuvenation\u2014a much-needed quenching by the thirsty earth.\n\nAs dawn approaches tomorrow, expect the clouds to cling stubbornly overhead, offering only glimpses of the sun\u2019s warmth. With high temperatures barely scraping fifty-six degrees, dressing warmly will be essential. A cozy sweater layered beneath a waterproof jacket will suffice for a brisk jaunt to the local caf\u00e9, or perhaps to stroll through the nearby parks, where droplets will cling to budding leaves. While the weather may seem dreary to some, those who venture out can bask in the quiet charm that only rain can bring\u2014a chance to watch the city glimmer and reflect, sip hot drinks, and perhaps indulge in the simple pleasure of curling up with a book in a favorite nook.",
