    "weather_report": "As the sun begins its descent this evening, Downtown San Francisco enjoys a mostly sunny afternoon, with vibrant clarity gracing the city streets. The winds speak softly, urging the clouds to dance and revealing the gentle influence of the ocean beyond. However, as night approaches, there's a hint of drizzle after 11 pm, weaving a subtle promise of moisture that may cloak the city in soft veils. The temperature settles comfortably around the mid-fifties, suggesting that a light jacket will be a welcome companion should you step outdoors.\n\nThe lingering warmth of the day is inviting, yet the cooling breeze carries a whisper of the marine layer, softly wrapping its tendrils over the tops of the hills and the bay, hinting at a more mysterious ambiance by evening. The allure is to embrace the calm, perhaps ambling along Market Street or seeking solace in a quaint caf\u00e9 with a good book. As the golden light fades and the skyline takes on a dreamy quality, a stroll near the waterfront offers the perfect backdrop for reflective moments or quiet conversations. Dress in layers, allowing for both warmth and comfort, as you savor the last remnants of daylight fading into a soothing twilight.",
