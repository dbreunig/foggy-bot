The air is neither still nor brisk, a mild caress from the west-southwest hinting at the day\u2019s potential. As the sun makes its reluctant ascent, the city sighs, holding on to the cool embrace of the night. With a low leaning around fifty-four, the temperatures will gradually rise, nudging close to sixty-four by afternoon, before surrendering to the coolness once again. \n\nAs the day unfolds, a slight chance of drizzle is anticipated, teasing the landscape with hints of moisture after five. But for now, the city appears mostly sunny, albeit with some lingering clouds that might keep the brilliance of the horizon at bay. The clarity isn\u2019t perfect, lending a soft focus to buildings and stars that will soon be dulled by midday warmth punctuated by fleeting gusts dancing through the streets. This is a day to dress in layers: think lightweight long sleeves paired with a comfortable jacket for the twilight hours. The streets beckon with everyday pursuits\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll to savor a quiet caf\u00e9 or a gentle meander through a park, breathing in the scent of anticipation that only a waking city can offer.",
