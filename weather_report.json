    "weather_report": "In the early hours of the morning, Downtown San Francisco is cloaked in a blanket of tranquility, with a gentle whisper of winds softly ushering in the day. The sky, though partly cloudy, hints at the promise of sunshine, inviting anticipation for those who cherish the warmth of daylight. The temperature rests comfortably around 58 degrees, creating a serene atmosphere as the city slowly stirs to life.\n\nAs the sun rises, a canvas of golden light will unfold, heralding a bright Tuesday where the mercury is expected to climb near 69, though a slight coolness lingers in the afternoon air. Those venturing outdoors may notice a peaking fog rolling back toward the ocean, gracefully retreating to reveal the iconic skyline and the majestic Golden Gate Bridge standing proud against a backdrop of azure. This clarity offers a splendid opportunity to enjoy the more understated treasures of the city\u2014 perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a gentle ascent through the nearby parks, where sights and scents mingle in delightful harmony. As for attire, a light layer should suffice; a comfortable cardigan or a crisp shirt will keep the chill at bay without stifling in the breezy afternoon warmth. It is a day to savor San Francisco\u2019s essence, to let the urban rhythm unfold, and to embrace the beauty that awaits in every corner of this storied place, from its bustling cafes to its quiet, sun-kissed parks.",
