    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the horizon remains mostly clear, a stark contrast to the restless whispers of the night. The air is brisk, holding a gentle chill around 46 degrees, beckoning those who venture out to wrap themselves in layers. By midday, the sun will fully embrace the city, nudging temperatures to a comforting 56 degrees before they gracefully decline into the afternoon's brisk embrace. A soft breeze dances from the west-northwest, at times playfully teasing with gusts that could rustle a page or lift a hat off an unsuspecting head.\n\nThe morning's clarity hints at an absence of fog, leaving the famed skyline and iconic landmarks visible for all to admire. While hints of a marine layer may linger just off the coast, today's blue skies and bright sun contrast sharply with any shadows cast from the cool waters of the Bay. It\u2019s a day well-suited for a leisurely walk along the waterfront, perhaps stopping for a warm beverage at a quaint caf\u00e9 to savor the slow unfolding of a San Francisco morning. Those who find pleasures in exploration might meander through nearby parks, where the crisp air invigorates each step and the sun encourages moments of quiet reflection. A light jacket or a cozy cardigan would suffice, ensuring comfort as the city transitions gracefully from the cool embrace of night into the delightful warmth of day.",
