    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the day begins with a clear promise of sunlight spilling across the cityscape. The current conditions are inviting, with a gentle southwest wind stirring through the streets, their warmth tempered by the encroaching coastal fog that often wraps around the Golden Gate and the hills beyond. Today\u2019s high will hover around a pleasant 63 degrees, offering just the right balance to enjoy the outdoors while the sun unfurls its golden rays throughout the morning and into the afternoon. \n\nYet, as the sun ascends, the morning coolness will gradually give way, and by midday, temperatures may dip slightly with the shifting winds. The forecast hints at a mostly clear day, though expect a soft veil of clouds to settle in later, reminding us of the unique interplay of coastal weather. Those venturing out may find a light jacket or a cozy sweater most accommodating as the atmosphere shifts. This is a day to wander the waterfront, perhaps meander through a quiet caf\u00e9 with a warm cup of coffee, or explore the hidden corners of your favorite park, marveling at the fleeting beauty of the day before twilight casts a more subdued hue over the city.",
