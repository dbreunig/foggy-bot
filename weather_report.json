    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a soft embrace of cloud cover, suggesting a day that may fluctuate between sun and shy rain. The air, mild and inviting at around 62 degrees, carries the promise of refreshment as occasional rain showers could make their presence known after 5 AM. Those venturing out should consider donning light layers; a light jacket or a cozy sweater would serve well against the gentle southwestern breeze that whispers through the streets. \n\nThough clouds hover above, the forecast hints at the sun\u2019s optimistic rays attempting to pierce through, particularly as the day progresses. By late afternoon, temperatures may settle around 65 degrees, presenting a pleasant opportunity for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the marine layer often clings affectionately to the Golden Gate, as if reluctant to part. Should the clouds clear, one might indulge in a quiet coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or perhaps meander through the vibrant streets of the Mission, taking in the artistic flair that adds color to the San Franciscan spirit. Yet, with a 40% chance of rain lingering until evening, it\u2019s wise to keep an umbrella at hand\u2014just in case the skies decide to spill their secrets after all.",
