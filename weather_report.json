    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the skies maintain an almost ethereal clarity, offering a glimpse of the city filled with the soft glow of urban lights beginning to flicker. With the temperature slipping toward a mild 53 degrees, the air carries a refreshing crispness, heightened by a gentle west wind that stirs the atmosphere at a modest pace, accentuated by occasional gusts that dance through the streets. This evening is marked by a prevailing absence of fog, allowing views toward the Golden Gate Bridge and beyond to be unmarred, inviting residents to venture outdoors and savor the night.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the forecast promises a sunny disposition for the day, lifting spirits with a high anticipated near 66 degrees. Expect the same pleasant west winds, caressing the skin without overwhelming, creating an inviting backdrop for leisurely pursuits. As the city awakens, consider indulging in a stroll through the winding avenues or enjoying a warm cup of coffee at a corner cafe, where you can watch the world amble by. A light jacket will suffice for the morning chill without burdening your spirit; layers are advised for later, as the sun graces the skin with warmth and provides ample opportunity to bask in the beauty of San Francisco\u2019s vibrant summer.",
