    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a hint of coolness, with the promise of sunshine brightening the landscape. Clouds have begun their retreat after a light drizzle earlier, leaving behind a wash of clarity, though a whisper of marine fog lingers in the distance, particularly around the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. With today's high hovering around a gentle 64, those venturing outdoors will find the weather to be refreshingly pleasant, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many green spaces.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the sky will shift to a soft gradient of colors, inviting the evening to settle over the city. The low tonight will cradle around 54, so a light jacket or sweater will provide just the right touch of comfort as the southwest winds curl gently through the streets. Perhaps find a cozy caf\u00e9 where you can sip a warm beverage and indulge in some quiet contemplation as the stars begin to peek through the fading light. It\u2019s the kind of evening that invites connection, whether with a friend or a good book, reminding us to slow down and savor the moment.",
