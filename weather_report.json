    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the sky opens into a tapestry of soft blues and subtle lavender. With mostly clear conditions gracing the city, the low temperatures gently hint at a night that will settle around 49 degrees, while the brisk winds from the west northwest invigorate the air, blowing with a steady hand at 8 to 18 mph, occasionally gusting, a reminder of nature's playful side. The glow of the fading sun casts a warm light over the iconic skyline and the majestic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge, hinting at the serenity of an early May evening.\n\nTomorrow heralds a beautiful day ahead, one that promises sunlight and a mild high nearing 65. The absence of fog speaks to a delightful clarity that invites exploration and leisure. It\u2019s a perfect opportunity to venture outdoors, perhaps for a stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment in one of the many parks that grace this vibrant city. A light jacket or a soft sweater should suffice to keep the evening chill at bay, while comfortable walking shoes will carry you through the day\u2019s adventures. One might find joy in a leisurely visit to a local cafe, absorbing the vibrant energy that pulses through the streets as the sun sets over this captivating city.",
