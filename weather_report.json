    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of patchy fog begins to settle following midnight, embracing the iconic skyline in hushed tones and transforming the familiar into a scene of soft mystery. The temperatures take a subtle shift, lingering around the mid-forties before nudging towards fifty, while a light breeze whispers from the north-northwest, carrying with it the promise of the day to come. Tonight's atmosphere feels contemplative, a time for quiet reflection against the city's twinkling backdrop, perfect for cozying up with a book or perhaps enjoying a quiet cup of tea by the window.\n\nAs dawn approaches on Sunday, expect lingering fog to shuffle through the streets until around nine o'clock, giving way to patchy sunbeams that will gradually warm the air to approximately sixty-two. The afternoon will invite a subtle coolness, urging temperatures to descend, making it a day that dances between the serene warmth of sun and the crisp embrace of lingering coolness. Attire in layers would serve you well; a light jacket over a comfortable sweater will harmonize with the weather\u2019s mood. With such a contemplative scene unfolding, a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm muffin while people-watching would offer the perfect escape from the urban rush, making the most of a day shrouded in both stillness and gentle promise.",
