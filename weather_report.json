The evening sky, a fading canvas of warm hues, hints at the night to come\u2014cool with a low around 50. A soft breeze from the southwest carries with it whispers of the bay, inviting a comfortable embrace as the wind dances lightly between 2 and 7 mph. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, a delightful palette of sunshine awaits the city. The forecast hints at a sunny high near 69, with the warmth gracefully easing into a gentler 66 by the afternoon. This is the kind of day that whispers promises of exploration; a stroll along the Embarcadero could be invigorating, as you immerse yourself in the sights and sounds of the harbor, perhaps stopping for a coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9. Ideal attire would include a light jacket to welcome the refreshing air, layered over a comfortable shirt, perfect for the shifting temperatures. As you step out, take a moment to appreciate the transient beauty of the city under the sun, where every corner reveals a new glimpse of its unique charm.",
