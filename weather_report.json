    "weather_report": "In the early hours of a Wednesday morning, Downtown San Francisco awakens under a canopy of gentle clouds, with the chill of the night wrapping around like a familiar shawl. The air carries a crispness, suggesting winter's linger but heralding the promise of spring. As dawn creeps closer, temperatures rise slowly, encouraging a sense of warmth despite the coolness that still beckons for a light jacket. A light breeze whispers through the streets, offering a quiet invitation to venture outside.\n\nBy late afternoon, a chance of rain will emerge with the clouds thickening, whispering along the iconic skyline. The sun may fight its way through patches of blue but could largely be veiled, rendering a softer light on the historic architecture. It hints at the possibility of showers, but for now, nothing but speculation stirs in the gentle currents. Be prepared as the evening approaches; layering is advisable to ensure comfort against the fluctuating temperatures. Alternatively, seek solace in one of the cozy cafes that line the streets, sip on a warm beverage, and take a moment to watch the day unfold. Whether it\u2019s the excitement of an afternoon stroll or the warmth of a nearby indoor escape, this day offers an array of choices just waiting to be made.",
