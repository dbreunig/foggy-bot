    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a tranquil coolness settles in, and the city breathes a sigh of relief under a mostly clear sky. The air is crisp, with temperatures hovering around a gentle 45 degrees, offering just a hint of warmth beneath a light North Northwest breeze. The stars may peek through the veil of night, hinting at a promising start to Friday. As the sunlight begins to warm the earth, expect a serenely sunny day, reaching a high near 60, gradually retreating to about 58 by afternoon. \n\nDespite the warmth the sun offers, a subtle marine layer lingers near the coast, skirting the Golden Gate Bridge with a whisper of fog, emphasizing the city\u2019s distinct charm. Dress in layers quite wisely; a light jacket will serve you well against the chill that might linger in shaded spots. The day\u2019s inviting clarity beckons the wanderers to stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps take a leisurely walk through one of the city's many vibrant neighborhoods, where the aromas of local cafes intertwine with the sounds of daily life. Embrace the day, allowing the city to inspire your heart and lift your spirits as you take in beautiful ephemeral moments that only San Francisco can offer.",
