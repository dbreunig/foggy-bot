As daylight wanes, the temperature gently settles around a comfortable 52 degrees, inviting evening strolls beneath a blanket of stars. The muted whispers of a southwest wind curl through the streets, adding a refreshing touch to the night air. \n\nTomorrow promises a sunny respite, with the warmth climbing to nearly 72 and gracefully easing down to a cooler 66 as the afternoon unfolds. The promise of an unobstructed horizon invites outdoor adventures, perhaps a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment spent in one of the city's many parks, where the light dappled through leaves can be cherished. For those wandering through the vibrant neighborhoods, layering in light attire with a breezy jacket will strike the perfect balance, ensuring comfort against the late-day chill. With no fog whispering its presence, the day is set to charm, beckoning San Franciscans to enjoy the crisp clarity of spring.",
