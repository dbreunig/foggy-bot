    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning begins with a soft, muted light that dances through a lingering mist, hinting at a day on the cusp of transformation. The air carries a touch of moisture, with the promise of rain still echoing faintly from earlier, but for now, mostly sunny conditions begin to unfold. The temperatures hover near a cool 60 degrees, a brisk reminder that even as the sun seeks to emerge, the bay\u2019s marine layer still envelops the hills and streets, hinting at the delicate interplay between coastal fog and clear skies. The west-southwest breeze whispers through the cityscape, nudging the lingering clouds along.\n\nAs the day progresses, what remains is a gentle, inviting haze rather than oppressive fog. This pleasant softness paves the way for leisurely exploration\u2014ideal for a casual stroll through the local parks, perhaps with a warm cup of coffee in hand, or simply sitting at a favorite caf\u00e9, watching the world flow by. Dress in layers to navigate between the crisp morning air and the warming afternoon, a light jacket or cardigan offering comfort as the temperatures dip slightly later in the day. Given the patchy conditions, today provides the perfect canvas for those seeking a quiet yet enriching experience; this is a day that leans gently into the beauty of San Francisco's varied landscape, a reminder that even in the heart of spring, the city's charm lies in its very unpredictability.",
