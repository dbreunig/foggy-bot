    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, a thick layer of fog begins to envelop the city, weaving through the streets and wrapping around the iconic skyline. Tonight, temperatures will dip into the low sixties, and the gentle embrace of patchy fog carries with it whispers of rain, a subtle chance gracing the hours between midnight and dawn. A crisp west-southwest wind carries the salty breath of the ocean, providing a refreshing contrast to the warm glow of city lights fighting the encroaching gloom.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Wednesday, expect a lingering haze accompanied by the possibility of light showers, though the sun may struggle to break through until later in the day, when the sky may partially clear to reveal a glimmering patch of blue. The afternoon will bring a slight warmth, with temperatures hovering near sixty-seven, providing a comfortable backdrop for a variety of pursuits. Given the atmospheric uncertainty, layering is wise: a light jacket over a breathable top serves well to navigate the variable environment. For those drawn to the outdoors, a stroll through the nearby park might yield tranquility, with the scent of damp earth adding to the richness of the experience. Alternatively, seeking the warmth of a cozy caf\u00e9 to enjoy a quiet cup of coffee or an evening read would offer solace amidst the misty charm of the season.",
