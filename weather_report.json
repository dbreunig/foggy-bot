    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is predominantly enveloped in a shroud of cloudiness, hinting at a night that whispers rather than shouts. As the warmth of the day begins to recede into twilight, the temperature will settle at a mild embrace around 54 degrees, accompanied by a spirited west-southwest wind that dances through the streets at 16 to 23 mph, with occasional gusts that stir the leaves and ruffle the hair. The presence of any fog remains subtle, a transient whisper against the backdrop of the city. \n\nAs dawn breaks over the horizon tomorrow, expect the sun to rise ever so gently, lifting the veil of clouds to unveil a mostly sunny day ahead. With a high hovering near 64, dipping to the low 60s in the afternoon, the city will beckon residents outdoors. This is an ideal moment to don layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket to fend off the morning chill and a breathable shirt for the afternoon warmth. The weather invites leisurely strolls along the waterfront, casual coffee catch-ups at local caf\u00e9s, or perhaps an exploration of the city's hidden corners, absorbing the vibrant pulse as people resume their rhythms. The day appears poised to be one of those quintessential San Francisco experiences\u2014a blend of sun and breeze, accessible yet rich with potential for quiet enjoyment.",
