    "weather_report": "In the early hours of the morning, Downtown San Francisco wakes under a mostly cloudy sky with a gentle breeze whispering through the streets. The atmosphere carries a hint of moisture, teasing a slight chance of rain that may add a soft sparkle to the pavements by dawn. As the day unfolds, expect glimpses of sunshine piercing through the clouds, heralding a more pleasant afternoon. The temperature will be moderate, cooling subtly as the day wanes, perfect for light layering.\n\nFog, a quintessential companion to the bay, might linger at the edges, veiling the Golden Gate Bridge in a ghostly embrace while the city itself remains distinctly clear. One might choose to venture into the world with a light sweater and perhaps a rain jacket just in case. A leisurely stroll along the waterfront seems fitting, perhaps indulging in a moment of quiet reflection or enjoyment of a warm cup from a nearby caf\u00e9. Embrace this serene yet dynamic day, letting the unique San Francisco atmosphere envelop you.",
