    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm envelops the city, the air turning crisp around 46 degrees. The skies are mostly clear, offering a serene vista of stars peeking through the fading light, while a soft breeze whispers along the streets. Tomorrow beckons with promises of sunlight, a high hovering near 61 degrees, invoking a warmth that\u2019s not too overpowering as afternoon approaches. Subtle shifts will see temperatures ease back to a cooler 57, encouraging leisurely strolls along the waterfront or quiet moments in sun-drenched parks.\n\nThe lack of fog and a retreating marine layer create an inviting scene\u2014perfect for embracing the simple pleasures of life. A light jacket should suffice for warmth as the evening proceeds, while layers will keep you comfortable tomorrow against the ever-volatile coastal climate. As you consider how to spend the evening, perhaps a quiet walk along the Embarcadero would satisfy, or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, allowing you to reflect on the beauty of your surroundings. If the morning awakens with clarity, a leisurely brunch accompanied by a gentle view of the bay would be a wonderful way to savor the weather before the crowds arrive, framed by the harmonious dance between sun and sea.",
