    "weather_report": "As the night whispers softly over Downtown San Francisco, a cloak of patchy fog wraps around the city, lending a serene but mysterious quality to the evening air. It\u2019s a low, gentle 51 degrees, with a breeze from the west stirring just enough to carry the coolness, a reminder of the ocean's proximity. Tomorrow holds promise, with the sun set to make its appearance, breaking through the fog before 11 a.m. and casting a gentle warmth upon the streets, as temperatures rise toward a modest 62. However, as the day unfolds into the afternoon, one can expect a subtle retreat, with the air cooling slightly to around 59 degrees, a comfortable embrace for those meandering about the city.\n\nFor those venturing outdoors, it's wise to dress in layers, with a light jacket at hand, shielding against the morning chill while remaining prepared for the sun peeking through the clouds. Savoring a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero as the fog dissipates offers a delightful start to the day, perhaps followed by an indulgent stop at a local cafe for a warm cup of coffee, where the chatter of patrons mingles with the sounds of the waves gently lapping at the shore. The day ahead, with its mix of clarity and lingering coastal fog, offers a canvas on which to paint simple pleasures, ideal for exploring the nooks of the city or unwinding on a park bench with a good book, as the vibrant pulse of life continues to unfold around you.",
