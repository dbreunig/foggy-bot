    "weather_report": "Amidst the echoes of the city waking, the morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds with a whisper of moisture still lingering in the air, hinting at a subtle drizzle that kissed the streets earlier. The skies hold a delicate mix of clouds and the promise of sun, with a gentle swell of warmth nudging the temperature up to a comfortable 65 degrees. Yet, as the day stretches, a cool undertow drags it back down to a more tempered 63. The winds, appearing with character, sweep in from the west, carrying both vigor and chill\u2014a cicada symphony at 12 to 23 mph, with occasional gusts reminding us of their playful nature.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds draw their curtains tighter, wrapping the city in a gentle, gray embrace, and a cooler breath settles in at around 56 degrees. Throughout the day, glimpses of blue may flicker through the clouds, but one can sense the marine layer lurking not too far offshore, infusing the air with that distinctive scent of salt and freedom, urging locals to bundle up a touch more for their evening pursuits. A lightweight jacket will prove companionable as the breezy winds settle in, ideal for snuggling into while taking a stroll along the Embarcadero or indulging in a quiet moment at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, where the sights and sounds of the city hum around you like a familiar tune.",
