    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco tonight enjoys a veil of clarity, with only the faintest whisperings of fog lingering in the cooler evening air. As the sun retreats, the city\u2019s skyline stands proud against a backdrop of deepening twilight, embellished occasionally by the soft brush of a west wind, which dances playfully through the streets at around 16 to 20 miles per hour. The temperature settles into a gentle chill, perfect for a light sweater or a cozy jacket, enveloping you in comfort as you step out.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the promise of a sunlit day draws near. Expect a high near 64, as the morning clears to reveal the golden warmth of the sun. Those winds will pick up slightly, reminding us of the coastal nature surrounding this vibrant city, with gusts that may flirt with the thirties at times. With the sun gracing the sky and a touch of breeze in the air, it could be a delightful time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet caf\u00e9 visit, where one may savor the aroma of freshly brewed coffee while watching the world go by. Perfectly suited for the occasion, a light layer will keep you comfortable as you embrace the delightful San Francisco charm.",
