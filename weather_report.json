    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a delicate dance of clouds plays across the sky, filtering the sunlight into a muted glow. Presently, the air feels brisk, the temperature hovering unseasonably cool, with anticipatory hints of rain that swirl in from the west. With the forecast hinting at a chance of showers before evening, one might glimpse the Golden Gate Bridge shrouded softly by low-hanging clouds, suggesting the presence of that familiar marine layer creeping in, a reminder of the city\u2019s ever-changing weather. \n\nBy nightfall, the rain is sure to embrace the city more fervently, transforming the streets into a shimmering tableau. Residents would do well to dress warmly, perhaps donning a sturdy jacket beneath which a soft sweater can ward off the chill, complemented by an umbrella, just in case the evening\u2019s forecast holds true. With a forecast of steady showers ahead, the time could be best spent enjoying a quiet moment in a local caf\u00e9 with warm coffee or tea, perhaps gazing out at the veils of rain that create a serene backdrop, or taking a leisurely stroll under the canopy of clouds, appreciating the vibrant greens of the parks as they awaken in the gentle embrace of rain.",
