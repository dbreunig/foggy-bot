    "weather_report": "As dawn stretches its arms over Downtown San Francisco, a delicate mix of partly cloudy skies and cool breezes envelops the city. The air feels fresh, almost invigorating, with the temperature resting comfortably at around 53 degrees. The west wind, brisk yet refreshing at about 21 mph, hints at the day to come, lifting the spirits of early risers while carrying whispers of the vast Pacific beyond. Throughout the night, an ethereal marine layer has settled over the bay, veiling the usual familiarity of landmarks with a soft embrace of fog, particularly around the Golden Gate Bridge. The mist, though shy, is still palpable\u2014most prominent where the land kisses the ocean.\n\nAs the sun prepares to ascend, promises of a sunny Independence Day lay in wait. Anticipated highs will soar toward a pleasant 62 degrees, though the warmth will gradually retreat to about 60 as afternoon approaches. Expect the winds to hold steady, their gusts potentially invigorating as they kiss the skin. For those stepping out into this tapestry of weather, layering is key; a light jacket should serve well against the briskness of the wind, while comfortable attire offers freedom to wander. A stroll along the Embarcadero or a casual bike ride through the Marina District on this mildly warm day would provide the canvas for some serene moments of reflection. One might even muse over an uncomplicated picnic, all while taking in the ever-changing hues of the sky as evening descends, a reminder of the beauty in the rhythm of nature\u2019s embrace.",
