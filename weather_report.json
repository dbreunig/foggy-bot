    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle clarity, bathed in mostly sunny light that casts a warm glow over the city. As the day drifts towards twilight, the temperature hovers around a comfortable 64 degrees, gradually easing into a cooler 61. The faint westerly breeze whispers through the streets, adding a soft touch to the vibrant atmosphere. While the iconic fog may linger just beyond the horizon, it seems to have spared the city for now, leaving only an ethereal hint of moisture on the edges of the Bay, where the skyline meets the shimmer of the water.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will transform into a partly cloudy canvas, with temperatures dipping to a calm 51 degrees. A light southwest wind will accompany this transition, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s elegant parks. Considering the pleasant conditions, a light jacket or a cozy sweater would be wise as day gives way to night, offering a snug embrace against the cooling air. Whether you choose to explore the local shops or enjoy a casual meal at a nearby caf\u00e9, today\u2019s weather invites you to appreciate the unique charm of San Francisco, revealing its beauty without the ineffable curtain of fog that often cloaks it.",
