    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds drapes the skyline, hinting at lingering whispers of the night. Currently enveloped in a mild embrace around 54 degrees, the city stirs awake to the gentle sigh of west-southwest winds, weaving through the streets at a leisurely pace. The day ahead promises to shift from this subdued gray to patches of sunlight inviting the warmth of a cooler, yet pleasant high near 64. As the afternoon progresses, temperatures will dip slightly, with brisk gusts occasionally lifting high enough to whisper through the leaves and ruffle hair.\n\nThe distant hills cradle the city, creating an ethereal feeling in the air, though the fog may still linger along the coast, teasing glimpses of the iconic Golden Gate. With today\u2019s weather gradually unveiling brightness, it feels like a day that begs for a stroll along the waterfront. A light jacket or sweater would serve you well against the marine chill, perhaps paired with comfortable shoes, ready to explore small caf\u00e9s or the treasures of local art shops. The morning holds its secrets, and as the day unfolds, an expanse of quiet possibilities awakens; it\u2019s a contented softness whispering, come, let us enjoy this timeless city before it bursts into full splendor.",
