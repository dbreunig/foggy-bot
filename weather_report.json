    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a bright, unblemished sky, a departure from the customary fog that typically blankets the Bay. With the sun generously illuminating the surroundings, the city is poised to bask in the warmth of a comfortably mild day, the beating heart of summer just on the horizon. The high is set near a refreshing 66, kissed by a westward breeze nudging through at 18 mph, adding a lively note to the serenade of the day. However, with gusts reaching up to 22 mph, a gentle pull against the warmth reminds one of the ever-present coastal influence.\n\nAs evening approaches, the charm of the city will morph, shifting towards a partly cloudy canvas, where the low will settle in the tranquil embrace of 53. A more temperate breeze from the west-southwest will prevail through the night, punctuating the air with a coolness ideal for evening strolls or quiet reflections in one\u2019s favorite caf\u00e9. To fully appreciate this splendid day, dressing in layers is advisable\u2014a light sweater may suffice as the sun dips, while a short-sleeved shirt will keep the warmth close during the sunniest moments. Given the delightful conditions, a leisurely walk across the Embarcadero, or perhaps a quiet afternoon spent lost in the pages of a book in one of the city's parks, would be an inviting way to savor the afternoon's good fortune.",
