    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over Downtown San Francisco, you may notice a delicate interplay of light and shadow, where the remnants of fog cling to distant outlines and the city awakes beneath a soft, inviting glow. Today, you might find the atmosphere slightly damp, a low chance of morning drizzle whispering at your senses, but mostly the day appears cheerful and vibrant, awash with a gentle warmth at around 64 degrees. A gentle southwest wind carries the smell of the bay, urging one to step outside and embrace the freshness of the air.\n\nAs twilight envelops the city, the clouds will begin to gather again, with a slight chance of drizzle after nightfall reminding you of the meteorological dance that is quintessentially San Francisco. Dressing in layers is the wisest approach; a light shirt or blouse with a cozy jacket will serve you well as temperatures cool into the evening. Perhaps take a stroll along the waterfront, where the cool breeze and the sights of the bay can provide a soothing end to your day. Or indulge in a quiet afternoon at a local caf\u00e9, relishing a warm drink as you watch the world settle into its evening rhythm.",
