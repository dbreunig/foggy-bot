    "weather_report": "As dawn's delicate touch settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air around you is imbued with the coolness of impending fog and the unshakeable sense of a city waking up. Presently, a low murmur of drizzle hovers just beneath the surface of the city's seascape, the clouds embracing the skyline with a kiss of gray. The forecast speaks of a 40% chance of precipitation, hinting at murky skies and patchy fog that flirts with both the Golden Gate and the downtown high-rises. As the day emerges, expect these conditions to shift from drizzle to a begrudging spirit of partial sun, yet it is wise to carry an umbrella and perhaps don a lightweight jacket\u2014your companion against the persistent cool.\n\nThe breeze carries whispers of the ocean, a reminder of the marine layer that blankets the city now, giving the archway of the bridge and the distant hills an almost ethereal quality. Though the day might offer respite with hints of warmth by noon, the temperature will still linger comfortably chilly, inviting layers rather than shorts. It may not be ideal for sunbathers, but it calls for an adventure among the sun-dappled streets, where the quiet hum of cafes lies in wait. A stroll through the winding avenues or a leisurely moment in a park can refresh the spirit, all while the city dances in and out of the fog\u2014an urban oasis wrapped in mystery.",
