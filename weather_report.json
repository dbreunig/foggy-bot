    "weather_report": "Under a gentle sun, Downtown San Francisco enjoys a serene afternoon, with temperatures hovering around 58 degrees. The air is crisp, and there is a noticeable clarity to the day, making it a splendid time to wander the streets or recline in a cozy caf\u00e9. Though the forecasted high sits near 60, the warmth of the sun brings a pleasant glow, subdued only by a light southwest breeze that whispers through the city\u2019s iconic hills. There is no heavy fog draping the Golden Gate today, although the marine layer quietly lingers in the distance, hinting at the forthcoming evening chill.\n\nAs night approaches, the mercury will drop to around 46 degrees, creating an inviting atmosphere for a casual stroll. Dress in layers; a light jacket will suffice as the sun retreats, allowing for a comfortable exploration of the waterfront or perhaps a visit to one of the local eateries, where the aroma of roasting coffee and fresh pastries permeates the air. Today\u2019s weather is a gentle reminder of the city\u2019s beauty, encouraging a thoughtful pause amidst the daily hustle, with ample opportunities to appreciate both the vibrancy and tranquility this iconic locale has to offer.",
