    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city breathes softly, the night air still lingering with a gentle coolness. The low temperature, cradled around the 53-degree mark, suggests that a light jacket is a wise companion for your morning stroll. The breeze whispers through the streets, a west wind weaving past at a brisk 13 mph, occasionally punctuated by playful gusts that dance to 18 mph. Clarity prevails, with only the faintest hint of fog, barely brushing the edges of the horizon, as if the city is waking from a dream.\n\nAs the sun rises higher, today promises a radiant transformation, welcoming warmth with a high near 65. The west-southwest winds will bolster their pace, blowing through at 9 to 20 mph, inviting those who seek outdoor adventures to embrace the day. Dress in layers, opting for breathable fabrics that offer comfort against the mild warmth and the cool kiss of the wind. Given the cheerful sun and invigorating breeze, it's an ideal time for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, perhaps indulging in a cup of coffee at one of the small cafes that dot the waterfront. You might find serenity in the art of observation as you watch the city awaken, life unfolding against the backdrop of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, softly framed by a sky now painted in hues of blue.",
