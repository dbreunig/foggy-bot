    "weather_report": "As dawn softly drapes its misty veil over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a mostly cloudy sky, the haze shrouding landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge in a delicate blanket. Temperatures rest comfortably around 52 degrees, with a gentle north wind whispering through the streets. The promise of a partly sunny Friday beckons, though the chill of the morning will yield to a milder afternoon high, settling near 65. Expect a serene shift in temperatures, accompanied by a light south southwest breeze carrying the faint scents of the bay.\n\nToday invites a leisurely stroll through the quieter neighborhoods or perhaps a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the warmth of freshly brewed coffee offers a cozy refuge from the lingering chill. As the day unfolds, pack a light jacket to combat the crisp air, especially as you venture toward the coast where the marine layer might still cling tightly. The clarity of the day is punctuated by patches of sun, offering moments of warmth that would be ideal for enjoying the vibrant yet understated beauty of this iconic city. Embrace the gentle rhythm of the day, for San Francisco's spirit is at its finest in these soft, enveloping hours.",
