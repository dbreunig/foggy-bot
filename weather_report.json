    "weather_report": "In the waning hours of the evening, Downtown San Francisco is wrapped in a shroud of soft gray clouds. A hint of drizzle may linger as you settle in for the night, with the air carrying a whisper of humidity and a gentle wind brushing past at a steady 12 miles per hour. The warmth barely dips below 59, inviting a light jacket, perhaps your favorite wool one, to keep the chill at bay. \n\nAs dawn unfurls tomorrow, a tantalizing prospect of sunshine glimmers. The day's warmth will rise to a comfortable 67, cooling slightly as the afternoon bestows both bursts of vibrant rays and those persistent, playful winds that nudge around 20 miles per hour. While there remains a flicker of a chance for drizzle before noon, the majority of the day promises clarity as the fog retreats to the periphery, relinquishing its grip on the iconic backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nDress accordingly, with layers that flow easily from warmth to coolness, ideal for a stroll through the Marina or a pair of quiet moments with coffee in hand at a corner caf\u00e9. Embrace the charm of a San Francisco morning that promises an inviting blend of activity and a brisk breeze, a day calling for leisure yet holding the potential for spontaneous adventures amid the glowing cityscape.",
