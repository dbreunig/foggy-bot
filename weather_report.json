Tonight\u2019s sky remains mostly clear, casting a soft glow over the iconic landmarks while a cool low of around 59 begins to take hold. The faint whisper of the wind, around 10 mph, carries hints of the salty sea air, suggesting that life continues just beyond the horizon.\n\nThe promise of tomorrow invites the day to dawn bright and mostly sunny, with a high approaching a pleasant 68. The forecast hints at a lively breeze, with gusts that may stir the leaves and ruffle hats, reminding us of the city\u2019s relentless spirit. The absence of fog tonight offers an unspoiled view of the stars\u2014a rare chance to revel in the luminous dance of the cosmos. Should the marine layer decide to grace us with its presence, it will likely retreat swiftly with the morning sun.\n\nIn this idyllic ambiance, dressing in layers will serve well\u2014a light jacket for the chilly evening stroll, shedding it for a breathable tee as the sun kisses the skyline. For those seeking the low-key excitement of the city, a walk along the Embarcadero would be a perfect escape, allowing the mind to wander while the evening hums a soothing tune. As night gives way to day, the spirit of exploration is palpable.",
