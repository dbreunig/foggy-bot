    "weather_report": "As the dim light of early dawn grazes Downtown San Francisco, the air is filled with a calm crispness, hinting at the chill of the early hours. Partly clouded skies, delicate yet unyielding, wrap the city in a soft embrace. The temperature lingers around a pleasant 50 degrees, with a gentle breeze nudging from the west at 15 miles per hour, causing leaves to dance lightly on their branches. By mid-morning, the sun will assert itself fully, promising a high near 63. The atmospheric clarity may begin this day with scattered cloud formations, yet the azure above is destined to break free of their grasp.\n\nFor those who step out into this serene morning, a light sweater or jacket is recommended; layers will serve you well as the temperatures tiptoe upwards through the afternoon. As the day unfurls, opportunities abound: a stroll along the Embarcadero, watching boats gently bob in the bay, or perhaps finding a tranquil caf\u00e9 to sip a warm beverage while idly observing the rhythm of city life. While the marine layer may linger along the coastal edge, obscuring the Golden Gate for a while, it will retreat as the hours pass, revealing the iconic sight once more. This day speaks softly of potential, inviting you to unwind in its embrace, no matter how mundane the choices may seem.",
