    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun bathes the city in a gentle warmth, with temperatures hovering around 61 degrees before gradually easing to approximately 59. A cool west wind dances through the streets at 12 to 16 mph, bringing with it spirited gusts that lift the leaves and rustle the trees. If one gazes at the iconic skyline, the clarity is quite remarkable, with fog only whispering its presence along the edges of the bay, leaving the central streets bathed in golden light and a crisp atmosphere. \n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will transition to partly cloudy, with temperatures dipping to a cozy 51 degrees. The evening breeze will linger, still playful enough to remind you of the ocean's embrace. Dress in layers: a light jacket would suit the day well, allowing you to peel away the outer shell as the sun graces the streets, then retreat back into warmth as the night creeps in. Given these inviting conditions, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps indulging in a quiet moment on one of the piers or aiming for the illustrious view at Twin Peaks where the city lights reflect in the bay.",
