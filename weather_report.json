    "weather_report": "This afternoon, Downtown San Francisco glows beneath a bright sun, casting surprising warmth into the afternoon air with temperatures hovering near 64 degrees. A gentle westerly breeze carries hints of salt from the bay, brushing against your skin\u2014perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or through Golden Gate Park, where the greenery thrives under the clear sky. As you wander, you might notice some wispy low clouds flirting with the Golden Gate Bridge, a reminder of the marine layer that often hugs the coast, yet today, the visibility is a splendid gift, making the landmark a picturesque sight.\n\nAs night approaches, the sky will shift, drawing a veil of clouds and possibly hinting at a slight drizzle after 11 PM. With temperatures cooling to around 55, it may be wise to wear layers, perhaps a light jacket to keep the chill at bay as the winds shift from brisk to mild. The evening could offer a perfect opportunity for quiet conversation over coffee or a book in a cozy caf\u00e9, embracing the slower pace that San Francisco evenings often bring. This day, with its blend of sun and clouds, invites you to savor the unique coastal charm of the city, a pleasure for both the soul and the senses.",
