    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks toward the evening, Downtown San Francisco finds itself under a gray blanket of cloud cover, hinting at the rain that promises to wash over the city shortly after nightfall. The air carries a distinct chill, settling around 44 degrees, crafted by a gentle yet persistent breeze from the south. Stark against the cloudy backdrop, the twinkling city lights provide a comforting contrast, illuminating the streets with a soft glow as residents and visitors alike prepare for the dampness to come. The certainty of rain is unwavering, with a 100% chance looming large across the forecasted hours.\n\nLooking ahead to the morrow, Friday's skies will remain mostly cloudy, hardly dispelling the atmosphere of a rainy day. Expect the chill to linger, with highs not much warmer than 56 degrees, and the wind will play a constant role, invigorating the landscape with gusts reaching 24 mph. Such conditions would call for a wardrobe equipped for warmth and water resistance; a sturdy raincoat layered over a cozy sweater, perhaps, alongside comfortable waterproof shoes for those who dare to wander amid the showers. While some may seek refuge indoors, consider embracing the charm of the moment: find a quiet caf\u00e9 to sip on a warm drink, delve into a good book, or simply sit and watch the world go by through fogged windows, feeling that uniquely San Francisco magic even as the rain falls softly around you.",
