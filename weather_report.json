    "weather_report": "As dusk settles gently over Downtown San Francisco, a familiar yet ethereal shroud of clouds drapes the city. The atmosphere carries a light haze that hints at the marine layer lurking just offshore, its presence muted but palpable. Tonight's low will cradle the air around 51 degrees, accompanied by a gentle southwest breeze that whispers through the streets, inviting a light jacket or a cozy sweater. \n\nTomorrow promises glimpses of sun breaking through the clouds, a canvas of mostly sunny skies punctuated with scattered clouds. The temperature will rise to a comfortable 61, ideal for a stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9. The interaction between the warmth of the day and the lingering chill of the evening makes layering a wise choice, allowing you to adapt as the city shifts from sunlight to twilight. With these conditions, a quiet evening spent exploring the lesser-known nooks of the city or simply enjoying a moment of tranquility outside seems perfectly in tune with the weather's rhythm.",
