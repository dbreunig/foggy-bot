    "weather_report": "As night drapes its quiet cloak over Downtown San Francisco, the air hums with a brisk calmness and a hint of mystery. The temperature lingers in the low fifties, beneath a partly cloudy abyss, where swirling clouds dance in the soft embrace of a west-southwest wind. The city sleeps, but soon enough, it will awaken to a day painted in shades of warm sunshine, a light breeze whispering promises of a pleasant afternoon. Fog, a familiar companion in these parts, is but a gentle ghost somewhere off the coast, leaving the skyline clear and inviting.\n\nAs the morning light breaks, expect the sun to peek through with a gentle confidence, nudging the temperature closer to sixty-two. The west-southwest winds may awaken, too, rustling gently through the streets, stirring the leaves and the spirits of those venturing out. Dress for comfort\u2014a light jacket will serve well against any lingering chill, while layers might be the unsung heroes of the day. It is a splendid moment to stroll along the waterfront or indulge in a thoughtful coffee, perhaps seeking out a quiet corner to watch the world breathe under the warming rays. Let the day unfold leisurely, revealing its understated charm as you navigate the streets adorned with the essence of San Francisco.",
