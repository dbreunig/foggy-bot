    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning has arrived under a veil of clouds, casting a muted hue over the skyline. The current temperature, gently hugging 52 degrees, hints at a chilly start, tempered only by a soft southwest breeze weaving through the quiet streets. As the day progresses, the sun will emerge gradually from behind the clouds, promising a high around 62, with winds growing brisker, swirling up to 21 miles per hour, potentially creating a refreshingly invigorating atmosphere.\n\nDespite this sunny shift, the marine layer may linger in the distance, particularly around the Golden Gate, where the tendrils of fog often embrace the coastal landscape. Those venturing outdoors might consider layering\u2014a light jacket accompanied by breathable fabrics, allowing for comfort throughout the day. Given the subtle yet alluring conditions, a stroll through the city's artful streets could uncover hidden cafes or quaint bookshops, perfect for lingering with a fresh brew or a new read, capturing the spirit of San Francisco in its transitional beauty.",
