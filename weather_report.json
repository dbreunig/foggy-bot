The afternoon's temperatures will hover in the mid-50s, a soft reminder that the season has not yet fully embraced warmth. As the sun dips, casting a golden hue that flirts with the darkening clouds, there's a whisper of rain in the air. A gentle west wind carries the scent of dampness, signaling a 20% chance of light showers later\u2014a fleeting drizzle really, accompanied by the occasional gust that brushes through the streets. \n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds may thicken, revealing a 40% chance of rain. A light jacket or sweater would be a trustworthy companion, perhaps paired with a scarf to stave off the evening's bite. Ideal activities for today could include a stroll through the quieter streets of the city, an exploration of a cozy caf\u00e9 with a good book, or simply enjoying the gentle evolution of the sky\u2019s palette from the comfort of a warm corner. The essence of San Francisco remains, even under the muted veil of clouds; today invites a spirit of contemplation rather than frenetic movement.",
