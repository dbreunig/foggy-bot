    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a sun-drenched sky, warm and inviting. With temperatures gently hovering near 67 degrees, the crispness of the north wind weaves through the cityscape, maintaining a touch of coolness that complements the balmy rays. As the sun descends, a lovely clarity remains, casting shadows along the vibrant streets lined with blooming flowers. This is a day that whispers promises of exploration.\n\nThe expected evening brings a pleasant tranquility, with the sky turning mostly clear as the warmth gives way to a refreshing chill around 50 degrees. The marine layer has opted to stay at bay, allowing the golden hues of the city to bask in unfiltered light. In such delightful conditions, one might consider strolling through the historic streets, savoring a coffee at a local caf\u00e9, or meandering along the waterfront where the gentle lapping of waves creates a soothing symphony. As the sun sets, a light sweater is recommended to embrace the coolness that follows. Today is a canvas of opportunity, painted with the serene beauty of a San Francisco afternoon.",
