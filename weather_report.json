    "weather_report": "As the city transitions from the quiet embrace of night into the promising light of dawn, the air in Downtown San Francisco carries a crispness, echoing the low temperature that blankets the streets. A gentle whisper of a southeast wind stirs the stillness, hinting at a day that will unfold with clarity. While the forecast anticipates a bright, mostly sunny atmosphere later, it does leave behind traces of morning fog, nestled in the corners of the bay, like a dream reluctant to wake.\n\nAs the sun rises, its warming rays will chase away the overnight chill, paving the way for a cool but pleasant day, topped with temperatures that beg for the comfort of layered clothing. A light jacket or cardigan, perhaps, would serve well against the unforgiving breezes that dance through the streets. With temperatures dipping back in the afternoon, a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a cozy visit to a local caf\u00e9 would be the perfect way to embrace the charm of the city while savoring a quiet cup of tea. As the wind plays with the leaves and the city shakes off its slumber, it offers a canvas of experiences just waiting to be painted by those willing to venture out into the enchanting warmth of a San Franciscan day.",
