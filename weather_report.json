The city awakens to a canvas brightened by the arrival of sunshine, with temperatures poised to reach a comfortable 66 degrees. A light southwest breeze rustles through the streets, carrying whispers of warmth yet tempered by the iconic coolness that characterizes this coastal enclave. For now, the skies are mostly clear, save for the remnants of a marine layer lingering in the distance, where fog subtly hugs the coastline, preserving the city's sense of mystique.\n\nToday invites you to venture outdoors\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll through one of the numerous parks, where the surrounding greenery becomes a vibrant contrast to the blue above. Dressing in layers allows for easy adaptation to the mild temperatures: a soft sweater or light jacket is advisable, protection against the slight chill that may accompany the breeze in the late afternoon. This day, unmarred by oppressive heat or fog, is a gift, making it ideal for a laid-back weekend market visit or a casual gathering with friends at an outdoor caf\u00e9, where the crispness of the morning transforms into a pleasantly warm afternoon. Simply put, the day beckons you to embrace the gentle allure of San Francisco in full summer bloom.",
