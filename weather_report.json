The air remains mostly clear, allowing for splendid views of the cityscape, punctuated by the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge. A subtle breeze, hovering between a gentle whisper and a confident gust, carries the promise of a cool night. With temperatures expected to sink to around 49 degrees, light layers will serve you well. A long-sleeved shirt or a light jacket would ensure comfort as twilight makes its graceful entrance.\n\nTomorrow greets us with the promise of sunshine and pleasant warmth. Expect bright blue skies and a high near 65 degrees, ideal for enjoying a leisurely stroll through the historic streets of the city. While the day may unfold beautifully, consider the wind\u2014rustling at 7 to 17 mph\u2014giving a nod to the brisk maritime influence that often defines this region. Perhaps take a moment to explore a local caf\u00e9, sipping coffee while people-watching, or wander along the Embarcadero, where you can feel the pulse of the city. As you embrace this sunny spring day, keep your eye on the horizon, reveling in the fleeting moments of light and warmth before the fog returns to gently blanket the evening.",
