    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is thickening, casting a muted spell over the city. While the afternoon began with a hint of sunshine, the promise of rain has already started to weave into the fabric of the day. One might see patches of blue trying to break through the clouds, but it\u2019s a fleeting hope; the gray blanket overhead looms with a 40% chance of gentle showers before the day's end. The air is cool, teetering around a comfortable 65 degrees, but that may bring a slight chill when the winds pick up to dance between the buildings, whispering at gusts of 21 mph.\n\nTonight, the forecast suggests a continued embrace of clouds with temperatures settling down to around 60 degrees. For those venturing out, a light jacket or sweater may serve well against the enveloping coolness, especially as the breeze intensifies. Evening excursions in this contemplative weather could mean wandering to cozy cafes or perhaps a quiet stroll along the waterfront, where the horizon blurs with the gathering fog\u2014a reminder of San Francisco's ever-present marine layer. In such weather, one might find solace in the simplicity of a good book or conversation, as the world slows beneath the draping sky.",
