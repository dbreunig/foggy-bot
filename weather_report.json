    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a gentle grace, the sun casting a delicate warmth across the city. For now, the sky is mostly sunny, though the shadows of clouds linger like whispers, signaling the afternoon's gentle coolness. As the light paints the buildings and streets, a soft breeze from the west southwest carries with it the fresh scent of the bay, hinting at the day\u2019s transition. The expected high of 62 degrees will gracefully yield to a comfortable 60 degrees as the afternoon sets in, merging the warmth with just a tinge of coolness.\n\nAs the day glides toward evening, the clouds will partially reveal the beauty of the night sky, making room for a low around 52 degrees. Considering these pleasant conditions, a light layer\u2014a cardigan, perhaps\u2014would suffice as the air cools toward twilight. With the sun high above and the marine layer teasing the edges, today presents a delightful canvas for life's simple pleasures. A leisurely stroll through the Mission District, savoring a warm coffee at a cozy caf\u00e9, or exploring the art-filled streets can unfold in this serene atmosphere. As daylight wanes, the city\u2019s vibrancy continues to hum, inviting you to embrace its quiet attractions.",
