    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under the warmth of a clear, sunlit sky, tracing towards a balmy afternoon, with temperatures settling just above the mid-sixties. The west-southwest winds dance gently, coaxing the last remnants of morning chill into the bay, where the famed maritime fog lingers as a memory rather than a presence. The anticipated slight chance of drizzle later tonight\u2014mere whispers of moisture\u2014promises no disruption to the balmy day ahead. \n\nAlthough the day retains a pleasant vibrancy, the nearby ocean remains restless, hinting at the occasional veils of fog that have become the city's signature texture. As the sun dips and the prediction of a cooler night falls into place, one might wear a light jacket, perfect for evening strolls along the waterfront, where the vistas of city and sea intermingle. Tonight invites a sense of tranquility, urging a leisurely exploration of local eateries or a quiet sit among the park's grasses as twilight wraps the city in velvet.",
