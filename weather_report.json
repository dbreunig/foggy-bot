    "weather_report": "As the night wraps its cool arms around San Francisco, you may notice a gentle drizzled whisper in the air, cloaking the city in a tender embrace of moisture. With clouds lazily drifting overhead, the temperature dips to a comfortable 56 degrees, while a west-southwest breeze rustles through, reminding you that the Pacific is ever-present and watching over the streets below. There\u2019s a slight chance of drizzle lingering softly in the shadows, hinting at a morning that will awaken slowly, still laden with moisture.\n\nAs Wednesday unfolds, the light will begin to filter through the clouds, nudging aside the possibility of drizzle by late morning. Partly sunny skies promise a high nearing 64, but expect that warmth to soften as the afternoon approaches, settling into a cooler 62. The winds will carry a crisp edge, ranging from gentle to brisk, intermittently caressing your skin like a fleeting thought. Dress in layers to adapt to the shifting temperatures\u2014think of a lightweight sweater that can be thrown aside, and perhaps a light jacket for the wind if you find yourself along the waterfront. Given the weather is not overly oppressive, it\u2019s a splendid opportunity for a quiet morning stroll along the Marina, where the bay\u2019s expanse can clear your mind and refresh your spirit. Mornings like this beckon for simple pleasures, urging you to engage in the tranquility before the day fully unfurls its canvas.",
