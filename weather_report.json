    "weather_report": "As the night wears on in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity prevails. The chill in the air, resting at approximately 47 degrees, carries whispers of the sea, stirred only by a light breeze from the west. The sky, a tapestry of deep blues, hints at a clear expanse, promising a lovely Saturday ahead. With dawn's arrival, expect the sun to brighten the horizon, illuminating the city in hues of gold, albeit tempered by the cooler temperatures which may hover around 59 before delicately falling into the afternoon.\n\nTomorrow invites you to embrace the outdoors. The mild, sunny day is perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet visit to one of the city's lesser-known parks, where the play of light through trees offers a serene escape from urban life. Layering will serve you well; a light jacket over a comfortable shirt should keep you cozy as you wander through this vibrant city, listening to the hum of life around you. While the fog may linger beyond, it seems the core of the city will remain delightfully clear, calling for quiet reflection or simply soaking in the charm of its bustling streets.",
