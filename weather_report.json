    "weather_report": "As the twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the evening is cloaked in a soft veil of clouds, promising a tranquil night ahead. The temperature gently dips to a cool 52 degrees, while a brisk west-southwest wind stirs gently, whispering through the quiet streets with gusts that flirt with the boundaries of 20 mph. The city glimmers as lights begin to shine more brightly against the muted backdrop, creating a mosaic of urban life rooted in this rich coastal landscape. \n\nLooking toward tomorrow, the sun will rise with an assertive warmth, ushering in a bright, sunny day with temperatures peaking near 65. As the sun ascends, the clouds will yield to azure skies, inviting you to enjoy the outdoors, albeit with a reminder that winds may pick up, challenging the calm with gusts reaching 29 mph. A light jacket or layered clothing would be wise for the morning chill, transitioning to lighter attire as the day progresses. The charm of such a day is best suited for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or an unobtrusive coffee in a sunlit corner caf\u00e9, allowing you to savor the fleeting moments of warmth and clarity before evening\u2019s embrace returns.",
