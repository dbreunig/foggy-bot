    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a mostly sunny sky, offering a brief respite from the city's notorious fog. With the wisps of morning mist gracefully retreating, what remains is a gentle warmth despite the ocean's persistent chill. Current temperatures hover comfortably around 65 degrees, promising a pleasant afternoon as the sun plays hide and seek among scattered clouds. As the day progresses, expect a slight dip in warmth, settling around 63 degrees as a crisp west-southwest breeze whispers through the streets, carrying with it the salty aroma of the bay.\n\nAs evening approaches, clouds will gather, draping the city in their soft embrace, while the low dips to a cool 54 degrees, inviting a cozy jacket or a light sweater for those venturing out. The fading light will create a serene atmosphere, ideal for a stroll along the waterfront or a quiet evening at a local caf\u00e9, perhaps indulging in a book or lively conversation. For those looking to enjoy the late afternoon, a leisurely walk to explore nearby parks or vibrant neighborhoods would be perfectly in tune with the day's calm demeanor, making the most of the clarity before the evening clouds take full hold.",
