Temperatures hover around a gentle 66 degrees, gradually drifting towards the cooler embrace of 64. The light west-southwest breeze whispers through the streets, carrying with it the promise of a fine day, though its playful gusts could stir the corners of your jacket. As dusk beckons, expect a slight chance of drizzle after the clock paints 11. The clouds will roll in, bringing with them a moody ambience, as the low dips to around 59, inviting a cozy atmosphere for the evening.\n\nWith a slight marine layer likely lingering near the coast, pockets of fog may dance along the Golden Gate, softening the edges of the iconic structures. Still, the clarity in the heart of the city remains inviting, with ideal conditions for a leisurely stroll or a visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s. Dressing in layers will serve you well; a light jacket should suffice to ward off the evening chill, perfect for savoring warm drinks on an outdoor patio. Embrace the day with simple pleasure\u2014consider a read in one of the parks or a casual exploration of the streets, where each step reveals the vibrant heartbeat of San Francisco\u2019s ever-evolving landscape.",
