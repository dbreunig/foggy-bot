    "weather_report": "As the night gently cradles Downtown San Francisco, a soft drizzle dances upon the streets, giving the city an intimate, almost ethereal quality. The pervasive fog wraps around familiar landmarks, obscuring their outlines and lending a sense of mystery to the urban sprawl. With temperatures hovering around a cool 48 degrees, the atmosphere feels fresh but brisk, urging residents to cocoon themselves in layers that blend comfort with style\u2014perhaps a stylish trench coat over a cozy sweater, accompanied by a pair of comfortable shoes suitable for slick pavement.\n\nAs the morning light struggles to break through the clouds, the forecast hints at a day that will start with the embrace of fog and drizzle but promises a brief flirtation with sunshine as the hours progress. By midday, the fog may lift just enough for glimpses of blue sky, though the looming chance of rain could soon reestablish a gray fa\u00e7ade over the city. Such weather suggests a day well-suited for contemplative pursuits: a quiet morning spent sipping artisan coffee at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, or an afternoon walk along the waterfront, ideally punctuated by a few moments spent under shelter, watching the droplets glide down windows. The day unfolds quietly, perfect for both solace and soft adventure, amid the gentle whisper of San Francisco's iconic marine layer.",
