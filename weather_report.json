    "weather_report": "The evening air in Downtown San Francisco carries a hint of anticipation, with a gentle suggestion of drizzle that may linger after 11 pm. As the sun dips behind the horizon, the clouds hang delicately over the city, creating a serene backdrop for the illuminated streets below. The temperature cools, settling around a mild 50 degrees, ushering in a fresh breeze from the west-southwest that whispers through the alleyways. There\u2019s a faint chance of moisture on the horizon, though the clouds seem to play coy, letting only a light mist drift through, suggesting the evening may remain largely dry.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the day's promise is one of gentle warmth and clarity, a slight shimmer of sun penetrating the lingering coastal clouds. The high will be near 59, inviting a chance of light drizzle before midday, but ultimately yielding to a more sunny disposition as the day unfolds. It\u2019s a good time to wrap yourself in layers: a light jacket over a comfortable shirt would suffice, perfect for strolling through the local parks or perhaps enjoying a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, where warm coffee embraces the chill in the air. As dusk approaches, the cool breeze may return, hinting at the whimsical dance of the marine layer just beyond the hills, making it an excellent time to explore the city's secrets before the fog rolls back in.",
