    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this morning, the air is still and bright, a clear invitation to embrace the day ahead. The sun bathes the cityscape in warm golden hues, gently nudging the temperature toward a pleasant high near 70 degrees. As the day progresses, a slight coolness will emerge, wrapping the afternoon in a soothing embrace as temperatures dip toward 68. The soft southwest wind whispers through the streets, caressing the face with gusts up to 21 mph, making it beneficial to consider a light jacket for the later hours when the warmth of the sun fades.\n\nTonight, the clarity of the evening will reveal a mostly clear sky, shimmering with stars, and a low settling around a comfortable 56 degrees. As the marine layer lingers on the horizon, painting the edges of the bay with whispers of mist, it\u2019s a reminder of the city\u2019s transformation by the shore. Today presents an opportunity for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where you can enjoy the cool breeze and breathtaking vistas across the water. As you consider your attire, a comfortable long-sleeve shirt or light sweater might be prudent, ensuring you\u2019re ready for the ebb and flow of coastal air. Engage in simple pleasures: sip a fresh brew at a local caf\u00e9, or perhaps linger in one of the parks, letting the day pass in gentle tranquility, dancing with the rhythms of the harbor.",
