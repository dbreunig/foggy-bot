Tonight, expect a gentle embrace of fog rolling in, with temperatures quietly settling around fifty-two degrees. The breeze from the west-southwest stirs softly, its whisper inviting the chill of evening. \n\nTomorrow promises a respite with the sun peeking through the marine layer, revealing glimpses of blue skies. Anticipate temperatures climbing to a comfortable sixty-one, accompanied by a light southwest wind that dances through the streets. For those venturing out, layering is key\u2014think of a light sweater atop a comfortable shirt, allowing for the transition from the cool morning air to the pleasant midday warmth. Given these conditions, this is an ideal time to embark on a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps pausing for a moment to savor a warm beverage while watching the clouds play across the bay, an invitation to embrace the grounded yet ethereal beauty of this vibrant city.",
