    "weather_report": "As night blankets Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a whisper of dampness, hinting at a slight chance of drizzle that may come and go before the sun makes its slow ascent. The clouds cling gently to the skyline, but the west-southwest winds promise an escape from the thickest layers, offering a respite to the chill prompting the city to stir from its slumber. By morning, we can expect the clouds to part, revealing a mostly sunny day that caresses the city with a modest warmth, drawing gradually to a comfortable high near 67 degrees in the late afternoon.\n\nDespite the arrival of sun, a marine layer lingers, creating a gentle veil that softens the edges of iconic landmarks. While the forecast suggests a perfect backdrop for outdoor pursuits, morning drizzles might provide a faint allure to the discerning wandering spirit. As temperatures fluctuate, a light jacket or sweater remains a prudent companion, especially as the winds pick up in the afternoon. A stroll along the waterfront, perhaps with a warm beverage cradled between hands, would suit today\u2019s changing moods \u2013 a perfect way to embrace the shifting light as it dances across the bay and softly kisses the Golden Gate.",
