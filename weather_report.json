    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco lies enveloped in a gentle cloak of patchy drizzle and overcast skies, the city breathing a moist, cool air that hints at the day to come. With temperatures resting around a mild 56 degrees, warmth beckons from the hearths of nearby caf\u00e9s, where the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the coolness outside. As morning unfolds, the drizzle may persist briefly before giving way to occasional patches of sun that will flicker through, casting golden hues against the dampened streets. By the afternoon, expect a slight decrease in temperature, as the hour brings the highs to around 63 degrees, soothingly cradled by a soft breeze from the west.\n\nDress in layers today, as the shifting weather can be both invigorating and chilly at times; a light jacket or sweater will serve you well, particularly as the wind dances playfully through the avenues. Allow yourself the leisure of a strolling venture, perhaps drifting along the waterfront or heading towards a tucked-away bookstore\u2014each corner of the city holds secrets worth uncovering. Take a moment to enjoy the persistent marine layer hovering like a whisper along the shoreline, a reminder of summer's gentle embrace, while the vibrant life of the city stirs awake around you. Today is less about the grand gestures and more about the soft touch of tranquility, an invitation to savor the simple joys of a San Francisco morning.",
