    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a blanket of mostly cloudy skies. A gentle west-southwest wind whispers through the avenues, hinting at the day ahead where temperatures will gradually shift from the cool embrace of the early morning into a noticeably sunnier afternoon. By mid-day, the firmament will yield increasingly to sunlight, revealing blue expanses that flirt with the cityscape, inviting exploration and outdoor pursuits.\n\nIn the quiet of the morning, the familiar marine layer lingers, perhaps settling near the Golden Gate, softening the contours of the iconic bridge. The mist adds a sense of calm to the bustling city, a reminder of the ocean's proximity and its gentle influence on daily life. As the sun climbs higher, expect a retreat of this fog, gradually dissipating and allowing for a pleasant day, with temperatures culminating around the mid-60s. It would be wise to slip into layers \u2014 light jackets during the morning hours will fend off the chill, while a comfortable sweater or shirt should suffice for midday wanderings. The scene is set for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9, or perhaps an artful exploration of nearby galleries. Embrace the day, for it promises both clarity and charm in this corner of the world.",
