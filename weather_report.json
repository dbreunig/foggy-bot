    "weather_report": "As dawn's gentle approach kisses Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a mostly clear sky, the peace of the night still lingering in the cool air. Currently, temperatures rest comfortably in the upper forties, with a soft southwest breeze that whispers through the streets. Beneath the soft cloak of night, one might notice the distant silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and the winding Bay, slowly revealing themselves as daylight breaks. \n\nAs the sun climbs higher, expect a bright Sunday painted in shades of blue, with temperatures climbing to a joyous 62 degrees. The day promises to be sunny, the air carrying an invigorating freshness that beckons outdoor explorations. For the discerning pedestrian, layering is wise; a light jacket or sweater will keep the chill at bay in the early hours, transitioning to a light long-sleeve as the sun greets the day properly. An ideal way to savor these glorious conditions would be to stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping for a quiet moment at one of the many waterfront benches, or to explore the quaint shops of the Ferry Building, where the aroma of baked goods mingles with the gentle sea breeze, creating a perfect slice of urban life.",
