    "weather_report": "Even in the early hours, a delicate veil of fog hangs over Downtown San Francisco, with the soft embrace of clouds melding into the cool night air. Despite the faint chill, the temperature holds a mild promise of warmth, beckoning the dawn with whispers of clarity. The winds, playful yet persistent, carry with them a refreshing whisper as they dance through the streets.\n\nAs the sun rises, lifting the fog ever so slightly, Sunday reveals itself as a canvas splashed with bright hues of blue. By mid-morning, visibility will improve, providing glimpses of well-known landmarks kissed by sunlight, though traces of the morning mist will linger just enough to remind us of the ocean's embrace. The predicted temperatures will encourage thoughts of light layers, perhaps a comfortable shirt accompanied by a light jacket to chase away the remaining chill. For those who stroll the waterfront or wander through the parks, it is an excellent day to let the breezes caress your skin while sipping hot coffee or engaging in leisurely conversations with friends. The day invites ordinary activities infused with a touch of beauty, perfect for discovering new favorite nooks amidst the familiar.",
