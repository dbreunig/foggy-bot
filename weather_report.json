    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the early morning air carries a whisper of possibility. A slight drizzle may linger softly, mingling with the remnants of the night\u2019s clouds, as the low temperature hovers around a comfortable 55 degrees. The gentle southwest winds, carrying a cool touch, rustle through the leaves, brushing against the city\u2019s busy pulse. With a 20% chance of precipitation, it feels like the sky is considering whether to open up, though the promise of a mostly sunny Tuesday beckons just beyond the horizon.\n\nAs the day unfolds, a gentle warmth is expected to rise towards the high of 64 degrees, illuminating the city in a soft glow. The sun\u2019s eventual triumph will reveal clearer skies, breaking through the morning gloom, though hints of fog might still cling to the edges of the iconic Golden Gate. Dress in layers\u2014a light jacket or cardigan will be your companion for the morning chill, allowing for easy shedding as midday beckons with more inviting temperatures. Perhaps consider a stroll through a quiet park or a leisurely exploration of a nearby caf\u00e9, where the steam from your cup can echo the early mist, making the mundane feel serene and reflective amidst this characteristically San Francisco weather.",
