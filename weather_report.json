    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the sun casts a warm gold over the city, illuminating its iconic shapes against a sky that deepens into a rich azure. With temperatures rising near 69 degrees, you can sense the gentle invitation to step outside, perhaps to wander through the streets or sip coffee at a caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating. The afternoon promises a slight cool down, ushering in a pleasant breeze from the west southwest, brushing lightly against your skin, making the warmth feel all the more delightful.\n\nThe marine layer, typically a harbinger of fog, has receded for now, allowing the famous scenic views to unfurl unobstructed. Yet, as the sun makes its descent later in the evening, the clouds may coalesce again, bringing partly cloudy skies by nightfall, perfect for observing city lights flickering to life against the soft backdrop of twilight. As the evening cools to around 54 degrees, a light jacket will suffice \u2013 a simple yet essential layer to embrace the chill without feeling burdened. With such pleasant conditions, a stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a local bookstore could offer the perfect backdrop to savor the day\u2019s closing moments, a blend of leisure and reflection that San Francisco does so well.",
