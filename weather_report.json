    "weather_report": "As the night clings to San Francisco, a delicate shroud of clouds weaves through the cityscape, hinting at the gentle stirrings of rain that may grace the morning streets. Currently, the air is crisp, brushing against your skin with a slight chill, reminiscent of the tranquility that often embraces the city. A west-northwest wind whispers through the alleys, carrying with it the scent of impending moisture, though the chance of actual rain remains a quiet murmur, hovering at a modest twenty percent. \n\nCome Thursday, a transformed city awaits, basking in the promise of a more optimistic climate. The clouds will give way to patches of blue, and with a high near fifty-six, the afternoon sun will share its warmth, albeit tempered by a breeze. Still, the chance of rain lingers until the sun firmly ascends, and it would be wise to keep an umbrella close, just in case. For those venturing out, a light jacket and perhaps a scarf to ward off the fleeting coolness will serve you well. As the day unfolds, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, indulging in the views of the bay, or a quiet moment in a local caf\u00e9, savoring the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee as the city awakens around you.",
