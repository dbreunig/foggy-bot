    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, a pleasant sun filters through the sky, illuminating the cityscape with golden warmth. A gentle breeze weaves its way through the streets, caressing your face with just enough coolness to remind you of the Bay's ever-present charm. The temperature dances around the mid-sixties, a comfortable embrace that invites residents and visitors alike to step outside. With clear skies overhead, the view towards the iconic Golden Gate Bridge is unmarred by fog, allowing an unbroken panorama of blue\u2014no marine layer in sight.\n\nAs the evening approaches, the temperature will dip slightly, whispering an invitation for a light jacket or a cozy cardigan. The lingering wind will temper any heat, offering a perfect setting to stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps to enjoy a quiet evening in one of the local caf\u00e9s, where the sounds of conversation mix beautifully with the murmur of the waves. This gentle summer evening encourages you to embrace the outdoors; a leisurely bike ride or a peaceful walk along the waterfront promises to delight. With so much to enjoy under this welcoming sky, the city beckons you to savor every moment.",
