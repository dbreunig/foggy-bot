    "weather_report": "In the early hours of Sunday morning, fog drapes the San Francisco skyline like an ethereal veil, softly muting the outlines of the city. At a modest 56 degrees, the atmosphere feels both cool and refreshing, with gentle west-southwest winds adding an extra whisper to the cool air. As the morning progresses, this haze will gradually yield to sunlight, revealing a vibrant day ahead. Expect the clouds to part, allowing the sun to shine brightly by mid-morning and gentle warmth to creep in as the high approaches the pleasant realm of 70 degrees.\n\nHowever, even as daylight emerges, the remnants of the marine layer may linger along the edges, especially near the Golden Gate, painting a visual contrast against the sun-drenched downtown. This transformation means layers are essential today; a light sweater or jacket in the morning will transition to a better fit with a comfortable shirt as the warmth envelops you. With such serene conditions unfolding, a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s could offer a peaceful start to your Sunday. As the city awakens from its foggy slumber, seize the opportunity to enjoy a pleasant day filled with simple pleasures.",
