As dawn approaches, the forecast whispers promises of mostly sunny skies for the day ahead.

A gentle breeze from the west adds to the pleasantness, sculpting the mist that occasionally lingers along the bay.\n\nIn the wake of this evening's forecast, one can expect the famed San Francisco fog to remain absent, ensuring a clear, illuminated urban landscape as the golden hues of sunlight slowly cascade across the skyline. Dressing in layers would be prudent\u2014for while the sun warms the day, the coolness of the evening air may still linger, calling for a light jacket to shield against the briskness as the sun dips below the horizon later. With the delightful conditions on offer, a leisurely stroll through the quieter streets or a calming visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s could create a serene start to the day, making the most of San Francisco\u2019s tranquil charm.",
