The forecast hints at a sunny disposition with temperatures holding steady around 66, softening to a pleasant 64 by the afternoon\u2014a soothing embrace from the city's typically cool embrace. A gentle west-southwest breeze dances through the streets, inviting a light jacket for early morning routines but easing the need for extra layers as the day unfolds.\n\nThe iconic skyline stands proud, visible through a soft veil that hints at the remnants of the marine layer; a light layer of fog may still kiss the edges of the bay, but it does little to detract from the vibrancy of the day. The horizon glimmers, teasing with the possibility of exploration\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero where the echoes of friendly chatter intermingle with the soft lapping of waves, or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, the aromas of roasted coffee rising to meet the clear sky. As twilight approaches with the promise of a low around 56, consider lingering outdoors to savor the shifting colors of the evening, embracing this day that feels like a warm, inviting hug from the heart of the city.",
