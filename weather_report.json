    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a gentle haze lingers just above the rooftops as the early morning hours surrender to the soft, golden hues of daybreak. Currently cloaked in a marine layer, the city\u2019s charm is slightly muted, with clouds whispering tales of the ocean's embrace. The mercury sits comfortably around 54 degrees, ushering in a tranquil chill on the air, and a west-southwest wind dances through the streets at a brisk pace, hinting at the day to come.\n\nAs Sunday unfolds, expect the clouds to part, revealing glimpses of blue and bringing with it a promise of sunshine by mid-morning. The anticipated high of 61 degrees invites a thoughtful approach to dressing; layers are your ally, as the brisk winds may nip at exposed skin, while warmth can be shed when the sun spills its light across the city. A light jacket over a long-sleeved shirt, combined with comfortable trousers, would make for a wise choice. With the weather turning more favorable as the day progresses, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps meandering into one of the local cafes for a warm cup before diving into the gentle bustle of the day. The beauty of San Francisco beckons, not just in its sights, but in the rhythm of its winds, urging you to find your place within its ever-changing landscape.",
