    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the golden warmth of the sun peeks through, painting the day with a gentle hue. While the high is expected to flirt with a pleasant 65 degrees, the cool breeze from the west southwest carries an invigorating 15 mph, with gusts that dance up to 22 mph. As the hours unfold, temperatures will gracefully ease into the low 60s, offering relief and a crispness that is quintessentially San Francisco. \n\nTonight, the skies will don a veil of clouds, settling down to a low of about 55 degrees. The winds will mellow, whispering softly at 7 to 14 mph as they guide the evening into a tranquil close. The absence of fog this afternoon reveals the city's iconic landmarks\u2014a true invitation to enjoy a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or perhaps settle into a cozy caf\u00e9 with a window view. Layered attire will serve you well, with perhaps a light jacket to navigate the slight chill in the air. As dusk approaches, consider visiting a local gallery or finding delight in a quiet park, allowing the softness of the evening to unfurl against the urban backdrop.",
