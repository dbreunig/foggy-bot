As dawn begins to stretch, tomorrow promises a sun-drenched embrace, reaching a comfortable 68, later yielding to a slightly cooler 66 in the afternoon\u2014a perfect balance for those seeking a bit of warmth.\n\nAs the city stirs, the visibility is clear but hints of fog still linger along the edges, softening the familiar outlines of landmarks against the horizon. The Golden Gate Bridge stands stoically, a silhouette against the shifting light, while the marine layer retreats from the skyline, offering a glimpse of another beautiful day unfolding. For those venturing out, light layers prove prudent\u2014the nippy morning air gives way to a pleasant day, perfect for leisurely strolls through the vibrant streets or a quiet coffee by the bay, all while absorbing the city's unique charm. A transitional morning blends into a cheerful day, beckoning the curious wanderer.",
