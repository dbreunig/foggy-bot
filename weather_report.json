    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the city enveloped itself in a cloak of clouds, casting a gentle dimness over the streets. As the evening cools, temperatures will glide down to a comfortable 49 degrees, with the promise of a slight rise through the night, inducing a whisper of warmth against the chill. As the clock ticks towards morning, expect the soft hush of patchy fog lingering between the hours of 7 and 9, a reminder of the ocean's breath melding with the urban landscape. \n\nCome Thursday, the day will unfold under a mostly sunny sky, briefly interrupted by the tantalizing tease of fog at dawn, yet yielding to clearer skies as the sun climbs higher. Anticipate a high near 59, though the afternoon chill will coax it down to a cooler 55. The breeze from the west southwest will flutter gently, a barely-there presence at 2 to 7 mph. Dress in layers: a light jacket will serve you well against the morning's nip, while a comfortable shirt will suffice as the day warms. With the day unfolding in a promising manner, consider a peaceful stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9, where you can relish a warm drink as time slips by, taking in the bustling rhythms of city life and the subtle transformations of the landscape.",
