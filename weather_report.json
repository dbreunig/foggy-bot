    "weather_report": "In the hushed hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco stirs beneath a blanket of clear skies, a gentle breeze whispering through the cooling air. As the sun finds its way toward the horizon, the temperature hovers near 50 degrees, inviting those who rise early to experience the city's serene moments. The tranquility of the night promises a day of bright sun and warmth, with highs touching 66, though a gradual decline to the mid-60s offers a pleasant transition through the afternoon.\n\nYet, even in this clarity, one senses the breath of the bay, the marine layer retreating as Santa Ana winds shift from a soft 3 to a robust 23 mph. Those looking to venture outside will find today a canvas ideal for exploration. A light jacket will serve well against any pockets of chill lingerings near the water\u2019s edge, while layers will be your ally as gentle gusts tease brief coolness. A stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 presents itself as a perfect choice for today\u2019s setting, offering moments of connection with both the sparkling bay and the lively streets. The sun promises to illuminate the famous bridge and cast a golden glow on the city's iconic hills\u2014all awaiting, patiently, for your footsteps to mingle within their expanse.",
