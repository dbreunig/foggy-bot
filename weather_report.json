    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this morning, the sky unfolds with a brilliant clarity, ushering in Independence Day with promise. The sun has just risen, casting a soft light over the city, but the marine layer lingers, creating a delicate dance of fog along the outer coastal fringes and sweeping over the Golden Gate Bridge. While the temperature is a gentle whisper at 62 degrees, the invigorating west winds rage along at 18 to 24 mph, adding a refreshing briskness to the air. As the day progresses, expect a gradual descent in warmth as afternoon temperatures hover around the low 60s, inviting a cozy embrace rather than the heat of summer\u2019s peak.\n\nAs the sun arches higher, you might notice the air sharpens in clarity. Those wishing to enjoy a day outdoors should dress in layers, perhaps favoring a light sweater or windbreaker to combat the coastal breeze. Today is auspicious for a serene stroll through Golden Gate Park, where the misty paths weave through lush greenery or a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink while watching the world go by. The day holds a quiet promise, perfect for unhurried moments or discovering hidden gems in the city.",
