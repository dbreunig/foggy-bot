    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco is basking in the golden embrace of a sunny afternoon, with temperatures hovering comfortably in the low sixties. A gentle west wind, brushing through at a brisk pace, invigorates the atmosphere, offering a refreshing contrast to the warmth of the sun. As the afternoon progresses, temperatures will subtly dip, dancing around sixty degrees, while the occasional gust adds a hint of playfulness to the day. Tonight promises a tranquil transition with mostly clear skies and a pleasant low settling around the mid-fifties, allowing the city to unwind under a blanket of stars.\n\nThe day invites exploration and perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the shimmering bay reflects the sun's rays, enhancing the allure of your surroundings. For those inclined toward more active pursuits, a leisurely bike ride through Golden Gate Park would be equally rewarding, with the winds ensuring a fresh experience. Dressing in layers will serve you well; a light sweater or jacket will be perfect for when the sun dips and the evening air cools. Enjoy this splendid day as the city vibrates with life beneath the expansive blue sky.",
