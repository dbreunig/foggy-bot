    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, a gentle veil of clouds drapes the city, giving it a dreamy quality that hints at a lingering marine layer. As morning breaks, the air carries the soft scent of a light drizzle, blending with the cool breeze that whispers through the streets. The temperature hovers around a comfortable 56 degrees, with a promise of warmth peeking through the clouds as the sun attempts to make its presence felt later in the day. While the drizzle should subside by late morning, the sky will remain partly sunny, hinting at a high around 62 degrees,though there\u2019s no escaping the brisk wind that may carry a few more clandestine droplets your way.\n\nDressing in layers is advisable; think light sweaters or jackets, with perhaps an umbrella tucked away, just in case the weather decides to surprise you with a soft return of drizzle. As the morning unfolds into a pleasant afternoon, this is the perfect time for a leisurely stroll through one of the city\u2019s lush parks or an inspiring visit to a local caf\u00e9 where you can appreciate the fine art of people-watching. Enjoy the mellow ambiance as the city shakes off its slumber, the clouds beginning to part, inviting you to embrace whatever unfolds on this picturesque San Francisco day.",
