    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the weather is a dance between sun and wind, with mostly sunny skies complementing the cool embrace of a west-southwest breeze. As the temperature hovers around a gentle 64 degrees, an inviting freshness fills the air, offering a pleasant backdrop as the early evening approaches. The gusts reaching 28 miles per hour might playfully ruffle your hair, reminding you of the ocean's proximity, a whisper of nature among the urban hum.\n\nAs the night unfolds, the clarity of the skies will present a stunning canvas, with a low settling around 53 degrees. The evening promises to be gentle and clear, a perfect invitation to embrace the outdoors. Optimally, a light jacket or a cozy sweater will allow for a comfortable stroll through the streets as the sun dips below the horizon. With the marine layer retreating for now, it's an excellent opportunity to linger outside, perhaps indulging in a leisurely walk along the waterfront or enjoying a quiet moment at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 as the city\u2019s vibrance begins to twinkle under the evening stars.",
