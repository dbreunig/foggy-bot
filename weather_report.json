    "weather_report": "As dawn gently brushes the skyline of Downtown San Francisco, the city seems to stir slowly beneath a cloak of partial cloudiness. The temperature hovers comfortably at around fifty-two degrees, with a light southwest breeze whispering through the streets. While the morning brings hints of sunshine, the cool air still carries a faint chill that beckons light layering\u2014a soft sweater or a light jacket will suffice against the lingering coolness.\n\nAs the day unfolds, it promises to embrace a mostly sunny disposition, warming up to a high of sixty-five before evening softly returns the temperatures closer to sixty-three. However, as the afternoon approaches, the winds will dance more vigorously at times, gusting playfully up to twenty-one miles per hour. The presence of the marine layer may keep certain corners of the city shrouded in a delicate mist, reminding us of the city\u2019s eternal relationship with the ocean. Being mindful of the wind and the potential for fog, one might choose a brisk walk along the waterfront or explore the local caf\u00e9s, basking in the transitional warmth of late spring. As daylight stretches, the city's energy inspires a calm afternoon: perhaps a quiet moment in a bookstore or a leisurely stroll through a park, where the rhythms of life pulse softly around you, suggesting that today is one meant for both quiet reflection and gentle wanderings.",
