    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the city basks under the warm embrace of sunshine, with temperatures poised to hover around a pleasant 65 degrees. The morning air, fresh yet invigorating, is tempered by a gentle westerly breeze, whispering through the streets at a cool 7 to 15 mph. The afternoon will see temperatures dip slightly, drifting toward the sweet spot of 63, inviting any who venture outside to don layers that embrace both warmth and serenity. \n\nThe softly drifting clouds hint at the presence of a cozy marine layer, but its hold is tenuous at best. Tonight, the sky will taper into a patchy tableau of clouds, as the low settles comfortably at 56 degrees. The evening offers a perfect backdrop for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or an intimate gathering at a local caf\u00e9, where the hum of conversation mixes with the gentle roll of the waves. Dressed in a light jacket over a comfy sweater, you\u2019ll be ready to embrace this daydreaming San Francisco ambiance, where each moment unfolds like the pages of a well-worn novel.",
