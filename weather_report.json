    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity blankets the city, highlighted by a golden hue reflecting off the structures lining the skyline. The day ahead promises warmth, with sunny intervals nudging the temperature to a mild 60 degrees, gradually tapering off to a refreshing 57 in the afternoon. The west-southwest winds, soft yet mischievous, flirt between 3 to 14 mph, occasionally gusting to a brisk 18 mph. The atmosphere feels buoyant, with hints of life stirring in the bustling streets, wrapped in the embrace of optimism that accompanies a sunny day.\n\nYet, as night approaches, the scene shifts, revealing a different narrative. Clouds gather, foreshadowing a steady rain that will sweep across the city after 11 PM, cloaked in the tender embrace of a south-southwest breeze that could intensify. With a low of 51 degrees looming, a 90% chance of precipitation indicates that lovers of the outdoors should be prepared with a light jacket and perhaps a resilient umbrella. This transitional day offers a window for casual strolls through nearby parks or vibrant caf\u00e9s, where patrons can enjoy warm beverages as they watch the world pass by\u2014encouraging moments of calm before the storm.",
