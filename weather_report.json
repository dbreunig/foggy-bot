    "weather_report": "The day in Downtown San Francisco ushers in a gentle warmth, a pleasant reprieve nestled against the ever-cool coastal air. As the sun stretches its light over the city, expect a high that tiptoes near sixty-three, retreating gradually to a cool sixty-one by afternoon. The whispers of the west-southwest winds playfully tease the shadows of the buildings, with gusts dancing up to twenty-two miles per hour, a reminder of the bay's captivating nature. \n\nAs night approaches, the ambiance shifts ever so slightly. A patchy drizzle may grace the city after two in the morning, cloaked beneath a blanket of clouds that herald the onset of a southwestern breeze. With temperatures settling around fifty-five, it beckons a cozy layer\u2014a light jacket or cardigan to ward off the evening chill. This shift in the weather invites one to explore the quieter corners of the neighborhoods, perhaps indulging in an intimate caf\u00e9 where the scent of roasted beans ignites conversations or a walk along the waterfront, where the gentle lapping of waves remains a constant comfort. Today offers a blend of brightness and softly curling fog, allowing for both bustling excursions and moments of tranquil reflection, presenting a rich tapestry for the senses.",
