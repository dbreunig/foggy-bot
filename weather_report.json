    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle hush envelops the city, punctuated by the occasional whisper of wind. The air carries hints of moisture, with a slight chance of drizzle lingering, though the skies remain mostly clear for now. With temperatures inching down to a comfortable 56 degrees, the breeze whispers promises of warmth and coolness, a fusion that invites one to wrap themselves in a light jacket or shawl. The sun bids a long, glowing farewell, casting a soft golden hue over the horizon, contrasted against the sturdy silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge standing sentinel to the west.\n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, residents may awaken to the faint possibility of drizzle before the sun fully asserts itself, promising a sunny day with highs reaching near 67 degrees. The afternoon may see a gentle dip in temperature, yet the invigorating winds will offer a refreshing embrace from the west-southwest, perfect for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or to find a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm drink. Given the largely clear skies, it would be a splendid day for a leisurely wander in one of the city\u2019s beautiful parks or perhaps to explore the myriad local boutiques that pepper the streets. Dress comfortably but keep a light layer at hand, as the elements can change with fleeting grace, tailoring the day to the whims of the ocean air.",
