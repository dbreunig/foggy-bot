A steady west wind dances around the streets, carrying hints of the ocean\u2019s breath, while occasional gusts add a playful twist to the atmosphere. However, as the evening unfolds, the gentle anticipation of drizzle haunts the horizon, though its arrival remains uncertain, with a mere 20% chance promising only a fleeting mist.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the city's skyline stands proudly clear against the backdrop of softening light, inviting exploration. Yet, a whisper of fog lingers, particularly near the coastline, hinting at the marine layer that often veils the Golden Gate Bridge, forging a striking contrast between the vibrant city and the cool, hidden waters beyond. For those venturing out, layers will prove fortuitous\u2014perhaps a light sweater to ward off the evening coolness, complemented by comfortable shoes for a stroll along the waterfront. One could savor an unhurried walk through Golden Gate Park, letting the enchanting mix of sunset hues and city lights frame a moment of quiet contemplation amid the bustle of urban life.",
