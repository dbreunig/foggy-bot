    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the evening unfolds with a shroud of clouds that enfolds the city in a mild embrace. Currently, the atmosphere hangs around 56 degrees, with whispers of wind rustling gently from the west southwest, sending an occasional gust that gives the air a dynamic quality. Tonight, the promise of a mostly cloudy sky prevails, hinting at the possibility of a few fleeting glimpses of stars, as the city settles into its characteristic coolness. \n\nAs the day transitions, expectations for tomorrow reveal a partly sunny forecast that suggests a welcoming warmth will dawn, with high temperatures nearing 64, gradually cooling to around 62 by afternoon. The winds may dance playfully, adding a crispness to the air, making this midweek day a pleasant invitation to indulge in the outdoors. With a bit of cloud cover lingering, the marine layer may appear delicately along the coastline, perhaps brushing the Golden Gate lightly, but left unseen by the urban eye. Prepare with layers\u2014a light jacket for the evening chill and a comfortable outfit for the day ahead\u2014suitable for wandering through nearby shops or perhaps enjoying a quiet stroll by the waterfront, taking in the tranquil rhythms of the city as night deepens.",
