    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city emerges from the soft embrace of a marine layer that has lingered about, a thin veil of clouds shining a muted silver under the rising sun. The breezes whisper from the west, stirring the air just enough to sweep away any lingering fog. Today promises a mostly sunny visage, where the high will hover around a comfortably cool 67 degrees. Gusts dance through the streets, nudging the trees, while the consistency of the wind lends a refreshing chill. \n\nTonight, a gentle transition ushers in partial cloud cover, as the mercury dips to a mild 57. It seems an ideal moment to dress in layers \u2013 perhaps a light sweater to accompany a breathable shirt, paired with slacks or jeans, allowing for comfort whether basking in the daytime warmth or beneath evening's cooler touch. The day beckons an array of simple pleasures, whether a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero, where the rhythm of the waves sings to the urban backdrop, or a visit to one of the many local cafes, where the rich aroma of coffee mingles seamlessly with the crisp coastal air. Whatever the choice, today is a gentle push to savor the delicate balance of urban life and nature's calming influence.",
