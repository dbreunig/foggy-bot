    "weather_report": "In the hushed hours of the morning, Downtown San Francisco is cloaked in a gentle veil of rain and clouds, the air thick with the promise of thunderstorms. A comfortable chill nips at the skin, urging the dawn to push the temperature just above the 45-degree mark. The city stirs beneath a cover of moisture, with the flickering lights of the early risers peeking through the dimness. The chance of precipitation looms large, calling forth the familiar sound of raindrops tapping against windows, a rhythmic reminder that the day will remain largely overcast until the sun \u2014 unconfirmed but hopeful \u2014 tries to break through later.\n\nAs the hours pass, the forecast hints at a shift, with midday yearning for clearer skies despite an ongoing likelihood of showers. Imagine the scene: post-rain reflections gleaming on the pavement, the promise of sunshine lingering just beyond the clouds, flitting like memories in the wind. The winds from the west-northwest will whisper through the streets, moving briskly with a demeanor befitting the coastal air. For those venturing out, a warm jacket is advisable, preferably something waterproof, paired with comfortable shoes fit for both the wet ground and the cool air. \n\nConsider a morning spent indoors, perhaps nestled in the warm embrace of a beloved caf\u00e9, a steaming cup held gently in hand, as the city shakes off its slumber. Or, as the weather shifts towards brighter possibilities, maybe a leisurely afternoon stroll through the quiet streets, absorbing the scents of freshly fallen rain, could offer solace, mingling with the sound of distant thunder.",
