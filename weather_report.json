    "weather_report": "This evening in Downtown San Francisco beckons with a gentle clarity, a canvas of soft blues stretching above, where the last light of a warm summer day dances across the skyline. The forecasted high of 70 degrees erupts into the reality of a sunlit afternoon that casts long shadows and ignites warmth on your skin. As twilight settles, expect the comforting embrace of the partial clouds winding around the edges of the horizon, hardly burdening the view, but rather adding a charming depth to the natural panorama. Winds whisper at 10 to 15 mph, providing a refreshing caress\u2014a reminder of the city\u2019s maritime rhythm.\n\nThough the fog and typical marine layer are absent from this evening's tableau, the coast is likely to hold whispers of the cool sea breeze that often blankets the shoreline after dusk. For your attire, consider a light jacket to accompany your explorations as temperatures dip to a cozy 56 degrees. It invites you to stroll down the waterfront, perhaps pausing to watch the lights flicker to life across the bay, or losing yourself in the splendid tranquility of a quiet park. Whatever the choice, it promises an evening imbued with the charm of the city, its sights alive, breathing with the promise of stories to be shared beneath a fading sun.",
