    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in the embrace of a sunny afternoon, promising a respite from the frequent mist that often descends upon the city. The air carries a mild warmth, though a hint of the expected evening chill lingers beneath the surface, urging a thoughtful choice of attire. As the afternoon progresses, the temperatures hover around a comfortable 62, tempered by a brisk west wind that dances through the streets, bringing with it the scent of the ocean. Gusts reach into the high twenties, a reminder of nature\u2019s insistence on keeping the atmosphere vibrant and alive. \n\nTonight, the skies will cloak themselves in a mostly cloudy shroud, a gentle contrast to the day's brightness, dipping to a tranquil 54. The winds will persist, whispering tales of the sea, and as you prepare to venture out, consider layering your clothing\u2014perhaps a light jacket layered over a cozy sweater before you set off for a leisurely stroll or a quiet dinner at a local bistro. This is a night ideal for quiet reflection or simple pleasures; take in the twinkling city lights or lose yourself in conversation with a friend. The weather beckons an evening spent reveling in the understated beauty that San Francisco offers as it transitions from day into night.",
