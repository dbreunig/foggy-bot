    "weather_report": "As the curtain of night gently draws back, Downtown San Francisco awakens to a tranquil scene, wrapped in the quiet embrace of a clear sky. The chill in the air, lingering at a low of 47, can be felt but carries with it a freshness that invigorates the spirit. Tonight, the city lies resolutely free of the usual fog, with only a whisper of wind brushing against one\u2019s face, offering a serene moment before the bustle of the day begins.\n\nTomorrow brings the promise of a sunny Friday, with temperatures rising modestly to embrace a comfortable 65. The afternoon will see a gentle slide towards 63 as the sun dips its golden hue over the iconic skyline. For those in the city, a light jacket may serve well during the early hours, but as the day unfolds, layers become optional for an outing to a local caf\u00e9 or perhaps a leisurely stroll through one of the city\u2019s many parks. With a clear sky and pleasant warmth on the horizon, it is a perfect canvas for enjoying the simplicity of a day that beckons one to step outside, explore, and take in the beauty of the urban landscape, whether it be in conversation with friends or simply savoring a moment of quiet solitude.",
