The cloud cover blankets the city, weaving a gauzy shroud over its iconic skyline, with temperatures settling into the cool embrace of around 55 degrees. A light southwest wind stirs gently, perhaps inviting a cardigan or light jacket as one ventures out into the dimming streets. \n\nTomorrow holds the potential for patches of sun to break through, a welcome change from the enigmatic clouds of tonight. With temperatures expected to flirt with 65 degrees before retreating slightly in the afternoon, it could be a day for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero or quiet moments in one of the local cafes, sipping something warm as the world gradually brightens. Preparing for the day may call for layers\u2014perhaps a comfortable long-sleeve shirt beneath that cardigan, allowing for easy adjustments as the sun dances with the fog throughout the brightening hours.\n\nIn this ethereal moment between dusk and dawn, where the marine layer hovers with a slightly chilled breath against the skin, the city feels both intimate and expansive, a perfect stage for the wanderer.",
