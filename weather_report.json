    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun makes its tentative ascent, embracing the day with a filtered glow against a canvas of blue sky. The gentle breeze carries whispers of the ocean, reminding onlookers of the bay\u2019s ever-present embrace. With temperatures reaching into the mid-60s, this afternoon invites adventure balanced with the cool touch of coastal air. The fog might linger, but not as a shroud; it hovers softly in the distance, framing the Golden Gate Bridge like a delicate painting, while the city itself basks in clarity. \n\nThis evening, expect a soft transition into cooler tones as the sun retreats, leaving behind traces of warmth. Consider donning a light sweater or jacket, particularly as the hours slip toward twilight. As the swirling fog begins to deepen, it creates an atmospheric charm perfect for a peaceful stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a leisurely coffee at a quaint caf\u00e9, where the chatter of locals matches the rhythm of the streets. A calm day like this beckons exploration away from the typical haunts, inviting a quiet moment to simply revel in the beauty of the Bay.",
