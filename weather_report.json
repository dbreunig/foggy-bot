    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the skies are bright and sunny, showcasing the city\u2019s charm as it embraces warmth with occasional breezes that flutter through the streets. However, as the day progresses, the temperatures will gently sink, and the wind will maintain its lively dance, mingling with whispers of the ocean. In this bustling urban landscape, the distant views of Marin shimmer under the golden sun, yet some areas may find themselves wrapped in a tender, secretive embrace of fog as the afternoon unfolds.\n\nAs night shadows begin to fall, the clouds will gently blanket the skies, ushering a low that hints at a cozy evening ahead. With winds that retain their spirited presence, it\u2019s wise to don layers, perhaps a light jacket over a comfortable sweater, to navigate the coolness after sunset. Perfectly suited for an evening stroll along the Embarcadero or finding a welcoming spot in a caf\u00e9, the atmospheric blend of comfort and coolness encourages leisurely conversations and quiet reflections. Whether it\u2019s savoring a warm drink or indulging in a good book, the San Francisco evening awaits you with open arms, inviting you to relish in its subtle beauty and warmth.",
