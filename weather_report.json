With temperatures lingering in the low sixties, there\u2019s an invitation for light layers\u2014a cozy sweater or a light jacket would serve well against the subtle, refreshing breeze blowing in from the west.\n\nExpect the day to unfold enchantingly, with hints of warmth tempered by a caress of cool air. As the afternoon progresses, any lingering fog should recede, allowing striking views that stretch all the way to the Golden Gate. The mild temperatures will encourage leisurely strolls through Golden Gate Park or quiet moments on a bench with a book. As night merges softly into the day, the skies will don a more subdued palette, perfect for winding down with a serene walk or a quiet dinner, perhaps near the waterfront. In this blend of warmth and coolness, there lies a beauty in the balance\u2014a vivid reminder of what makes San Francisco a timeless wonder.",
