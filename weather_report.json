    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city peeks through a veil of soft fog, remnants of the marine layer that often hugs the coastline. This morning carries a hint of moisture, a faint chance of rain whispering through the air before the sun takes command, bringing forth a mostly sunny day that promises to lift spirits into the ether. The temperature is a gentle reminder of the bay's notorious chill, hovering around sixty degrees and poised to slide down slightly as the afternoon rolls in. The wind, a familiar companion, dances with a spirited gusto, swirling at 12 to 15 mph, occasionally gusting higher, a cool touch that speaks to the untamed nature of the Pacific.\n\nTonight, clouds will blanket the sky, settling into a quiet embrace, leaving the city at around fifty degrees, a soft invitation to wrap oneself in warmer layers. As you step out into the day, consider a light jacket or a cozy sweater for the early chill, complemented by comfortable footwear for a leisurely stroll through the avenues. Take the opportunity to explore, perhaps visiting a local cafe for a warm drink or meandering along the Embarcadero, where the views of the bay can be savored even through the fog. Let the city unfold at your feet, a tapestry of sights and sounds waiting to be discovered amidst this mellow San Francisco morning.",
