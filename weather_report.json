    "weather_report": "As twilight descends on Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a hint of moisture, with a slight chance of drizzle lingering in the early hours. The sky, draped in a cloak of clouds, offers a subdued warmth with temperatures dipping toward the mid-fifties. A gentle wind sweeps through the streets, whispering tales of the day gone by. The horizon, while mostly veiled in the soft embrace of marine layer fog, suggests occasional fragments of clear skies, hinting at a shift toward clearer conditions by morning.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the grey will gradually yield to sunshine, with temperatures nudging toward the low sixties. The promise of a brightening day beckons outdoor pursuits, whether it be a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9, with the invigorating breeze adding a delightful touch. Dress in layers to warm against the coolness of the morning and prepare for the gentle escalation of the afternoon\u2019s sun. As the city awakens, it will present a canvas of potential, where each moment can be crafted into something memorable against the backdrop of emerging light.",
