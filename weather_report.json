    "weather_report": "In the gentle caress of the early morning light, San Francisco is cloaked in a tranquil palette of soft clouds and fading stars. The air, cool yet refreshing, holds a promise of warmth. As dawn unfolds, expect temperatures to drift towards a mild 79 by midday, tempered by an affectionate breeze from the north-northwest. The distant peaks of the Golden Gate are tinged golden, hinting at a mostly sunny day to come, a rare slice of clarity for this resilient city known for its foggy caprices.\n\nThough the horizon has yet to reveal all its splendor, hints of fog might linger in the corners, holding onto the coast like a secret. Dress comfortably, perhaps opting for layers; a light jacket in the morning is wise, as the chill of night still lingers, giving way to a pleasantly warm afternoon. As the day unfolds, this serene weather invites you to take a leisurely stroll through the vibrant streets, indulge in the aromas wafting from local cafes, or gather with friends over a picnic in one of the neighborhood parks. Such moments are woven into the fabric of San Francisco\u2014tasteful, unhurried, and rich in potential.",
