    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a calming sun. The temperature hovers at a pleasant 65 degrees, gradually nudging downwards as the afternoon matures. A soft wind weaves through the streets, whispering at about ten miles per hour, creating a refreshing ambiance while keeping the warmth in check. The clarity of the day is remarkably inviting; the skyline stands proud, its outlines crisp against a sky painted in serene blue, unmarred by fog, save for the gentle envelopment near the Golden Gate Bridge, hinting at the ever-present marine layer just beyond.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect the evening to settle into stillness and comfort, dipping to around 50 degrees under a mostly clear sky. It\u2019s a lovely time to unwind outdoors\u2014perhaps a stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where one can sip on something warm and watch the world glide by. Dressing in layers would be wise; a light sweater or jacket will provide just the right amount of warmth against the evening chill, ensuring one is comfortably nestled as the sun sets with grace. After all, in this charming city, each moment is a gentle reminder of the beauty that can be found in simplicity.",
