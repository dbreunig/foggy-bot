    "weather_report": "As daylight unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, a muted gray sky shrouds the city, hinting at the remnants of a marine layer that clings to the coastal hills. The air carries a crisp chill, a gentle reminder of the bay's embrace, as the temperature hovers comfortably in the low 54s, a herald of the warmer day to come. Wind whistles softly from the southwest, a cool companion to morning commutes. \n\nLater, the sun will breach through the clouds, casting its golden warmth over the city, with high temperatures nudging close to 65 degrees. By afternoon, expect a slight cooling as temperatures settle around 63, accompanied by a playful breeze intensifying throughout the day. Layers would be your ally: a light jacket or cardigan should suffice for early excursions, transitioning to lighter attire in the early afternoon when the sun stretches its rays. Perfect conditions for weaving through local galleries, savoring artisan coffee, or wandering the piers. In this transitional day, the world invites contemplation and gentle activity, a reminder to savor the beauty of San Francisco\u2019s ever-changing allure.",
