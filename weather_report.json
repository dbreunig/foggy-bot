    "weather_report": "As the evening descends lightly upon Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth embraces the city, tempered by the whisper of the southwest wind. The atmosphere holds a hush, partly cloaked in the sprawling shadows of clouds that drift lazily across the skyline. The evening low settles around a comfortable 59, inviting you to draw on a light sweater or a well-loved jacket\u2014a practical choice against the chill that often creeps in as daylight fades.\n\nRising with anticipation, Monday beckons with the promise of sunshine that bathes the city in a golden glow. Temperatures will reach a pleasant high around 77, sliding gracefully to the mid-70s as the afternoon unfolds. The sky will reveal itself, casting aside its veils of cloud to unveil a day marked by clarity. Those planning outdoor ventures will find joy in the mild breeze, perfect for a stroll along the Embarcadero or an indulgence at a local caf\u00e9, where the essence of freshly brewed coffee mingles with soft conversations.\n\nThough the morning may start with a hint of the marine layer lingering like a whisper off the bay, it is expected to dissipate, leaving the golden hues of the day to shine unimpeded. As the sun travels above and the winds gently shift, it might be wise to wear layers, allowing you to adapt with the day\u2019s progression. Perhaps a visit to one of the green parks, where time slows and the spirit of the city unveils itself, can be the perfect way to embrace the charm of a typical San Francisco day.",
