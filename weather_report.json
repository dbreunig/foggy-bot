    "weather_report": "In the early hours of Sunday, Downtown San Francisco lies under a mostly clear canopy, inviting the dawn's embrace with a low gentle breeze rustling through the streets. The crispness of the air carries a promise of warmth as the sun arcs toward its zenith, forecasting a delightful high near 64. As the day unfolds, expect the temperatures to slightly ease down to around 62 in the afternoon, a tender reminder of the city's fickle nature. In observing the gentle stir of the west-southwest wind, one may appreciate the clarity that unfolds over the horizon, hinting at the glorious daylight ahead.\n\nWith the current conditions supportive of leisurely pursuits, consider a stroll through the city\u2019s quieter corners, perhaps the enchanting pathways of the Presidio, or a peaceful walk along Crissy Field, where the iconic bridge stands sentinel. Attire should meld comfort with an awareness of the shifting elements; a light jacket would snugly accompany a layered ensemble, keeping one prepared for the ever-present slight chill that often settles by the bay. As you venture out, let the tranquil essence of the morning guide you toward a cup of coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9, offering the perfect moment to savor the city\u2019s morning serenity before the day fully awakens.",
