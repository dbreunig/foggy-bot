    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks just past midnight, Downtown San Francisco finds itself cloaked in a gentle embrace of rain, where the rhythmic patter on rooftops melds into a symphony of city sounds. Tonight is marked by a low of around 54 degrees, with the southwest wind swirling softly at 5 to 9 mph. The air is laden with moisture, and the sky wears a heavy, grey shroud, promising a deluge with a 90% chance of precipitation. Some timid drops may offer semblance to a sprinkle, but expect the morning light to break amidst a curtain of cloud.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the city remains in the grip of rain as the high reaches a mere 58 degrees, surrendering slightly to a cooler 55 in the afternoon. The southeast winds whistle through the buildings at 3 to 8 mph, wrapping the streets in a sharp chill that calls for comfort. With precipitation forecasts hovering at a full 100% chance, a significant soaking is inevitable, likely delivering half to three quarters of an inch of rainfall. This is not a day for leisurely nature walks; rather, it is ideal for cozy gatherings indoors. A layered outfit with a water-resistant coat, soft scarf, and sturdy boots will fend off both the chill and the wet. Perhaps a leisurely afternoon spent in a quaint caf\u00e9, sipping on warm chai, while the world outside is softened by the rain will be just the right antidote to the dreariness of the weather.",
