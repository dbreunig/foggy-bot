    "weather_report": "As night cloaks Downtown San Francisco, the city rests serenely beneath a gentle cover of partly cloudy skies. The cool evening air, wrapping around the shoulders like a soft shawl, carries the salty promise of the nearby ocean. The temperature lingers around fifty-two degrees, with a subtle breeze whispering through the streets, nudging the day\u2019s warmth away. This peaceful ambiance is perfect for an evening stroll along the Embarcadero, where streetlights cast a warm glow, illuminating the path for those seeking a quiet moment by the bay.\n\nLooking into the morrow, a promise of sunshine emerges, beckoning with the allure of a day filled with soft golden rays. Expect the warmth to rise, reaching near sixty-six before gently descending as the afternoon unfurls, inviting a comfortable ambiance marked by a light southwest wind that dances at five to fourteen miles per hour. As the fog typically lifts with the sun, one can expect clear views of both the iconic Golden Gate and the rolling hills beyond, making it an ideal day for exploration. For attire, a light jacket will suffice in the early moments, transitioning to a comfortable tee or a breathable dress as the sun rises higher. The vibrant energy of a sunny day offers numerous possibilities; perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm brew or an expedition to Golden Gate Park, where one can enjoy the blossoming flowers and leisurely trails.",
