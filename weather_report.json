    "weather_report": "As dawn brushes the skyline of Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of clouds lingers in the gentle embrace of the night, leaving a cool, fragrant air in its wake. The city finds itself wrapped in a soft shroud, the low around fifty degrees whispering of a typical spring chill. As the sun rises higher, the clouds will part, yielding to a mostly sunny day. By the afternoon, temperatures will float near 63, gradually retreating to a pleasant 60, the southwest winds lightly dancing at 2 to 10 mph, as if playfully nudging the city awake.\n\nFor those contemplating their wardrobe, layers will serve as wise allies in this ever-shifting coastal weather. A light sweater or jacket, perhaps, would be prudent for the early hours, giving way to more comforting attires as the day unfurls. As the sun bathes the city in warmth, consider a stroll through the quieter streets, with coffee in hand from a local caf\u00e9 or perhaps a visit to one of the city's numerous parks, where the greenery celebrates the day's welcome clarity. It appears to be a day where one can find solace in the ordinary, perhaps indulging in a leisurely read on a sunny bench or engaging in quiet conversation with friends, as the soft rhythms of San Francisco hum in the background.",
