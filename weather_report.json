    "weather_report": "As the sun hangs low in the sky this afternoon, Downtown San Francisco enjoys a rare stretch of sunlit clarity, although whispers of drizzle may make an appearance later. The air carries a soft chill, characteristic of this vibrant city, with temperatures hovering around a pleasant 67 degrees, gradually easing into the mid-60s as daylight wanes. The west wind dances through the streets at 18 mph, occasionally gusting higher, sending a refreshing breeze that invites a light jacket\u2014just enough to shield against the cool coastal air.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the horizon will remain mostly clear, hinting at the possibility of evening drizzle as temperatures dip to a comfortable 56 degrees. It\u2019s an auspicious evening for a stroll, perhaps wandering along the waterfront or finding a cozy spot at a local caf\u00e9, where the hum of conversation mingles with the gentle sound of waves lapping at the shore. As the city prepares to unfurl its nighttime charm, a blend of light layers and a scarf would be well-suited to embrace the ebb and flow of this intermittently misty yet captivating day.",
