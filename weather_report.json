    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco under a bright sun, illuminating the city with a warm glow. The temperature, approaching 66 degrees, invites a certain buoyancy into the air, although the breeze\u2014stirring at a lively pace from the west-southwest\u2014adds a refreshing crispness that makes the environment feel invigorating. As the sun dips toward the afternoon, it will steadily ease down to a welcoming 62, nudged along by a gentle yet determined wind.\n\nAs evening beckons, the sky will transition into a tapestry of partial clouds, painting the horizon a bit softer, echoing the serene energy of late spring. Temperatures are expected to settle around a mild 53, harmonizing with the cool evening air that whispers of tranquil nights to come. Though the fog that often blankets the Bay Area may linger at a distance, it seems to be biding its time today, leaving the city largely unshrouded in its ethereal embrace.\n\nConsidering the day\u2019s gentle warmth and fleeting clouds, a light jacket or a cozy sweater would serve well for those planning to stroll along the Embarcadero or enjoy an early dinner outside. One might find pleasure in wandering through the city\u2019s vibrant streets\u2014perhaps seeking out a decadent pastry from a local caf\u00e9 or exploring the unique offerings of one of the many artisanal shops. The afternoon light encourages a sense of exploration, whether you perch on a sun-kissed bench, drink in hand, or venture closer to the iconic landmarks that punctuate San Francisco\u2019s skyline.",
