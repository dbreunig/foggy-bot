    "weather_report": "As the afternoon light filters gently through the urban landscape of Downtown San Francisco, the city wears a cloak of mostly sunny skies, only occasionally interrupted by the spirited embrace of a west-southwest wind. With a high near 60 degrees, the air carries a crispness that speaks of the ocean's proximity while infusing the streets with a refreshing vibrance. Despite the bright patches illuminating the architecture, one can sense the subtle presence of marine fog just beyond the Golden Gate, teasing the edges of visibility and lending an ethereal quality to the horizon. \n\nInto the evening, the skyline will shift to a more muted palette as clouds gather, inviting a chill to descend with temperatures dipping to around 52 degrees. A light sweater will be advisable as the winds, though gentler this time, could unexpectedly rise and tease at your collar. With the fading daylight, this afternoon's clarity harbors an opportunity for quiet exploration; stroll along the waterfront or enjoy a late caf\u00e9 stop, where the ambiance remains welcoming even as twilight approaches. In essence, the day beckons you to revel in the fleeting burst of sunshine, while the evening whispers tales of cozy indoor corners waiting to be discovered.",
