    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, today greets you with an inviting sunlit embrace, casting a clear golden hue over the cityscape. The air is pleasantly mild, with a warmth that hovers near the high sixties, giving a hint of vibrancy that beckons outdoor explorations. As the afternoon approaches, temperatures will gently ease down to around sixty-six, carried along by a delightful, soft southwest breeze that whispers through the streets, offering a hint of that coastal freshness.\n\nThe sky, a canvas of azure, allows for an unobstructed view of iconic silhouettes in the distance, though one might catch glimpses of faint marine layers near the Golden Gate, hinting at the ever-mysterious fog waiting just beyond the bay. Tonight, as day transitions to dusk, expect a gentle invitation to cozy up as the temperature dips to around fifty-four. A light jacket would suffice against the coolness, especially if you find yourself meandering through the streets. The weather strums the perfect chord for simple joys: perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 where you can sip on an artisan brew, or a quiet moment spent in one of the nearby parks, soaking in the growing night as it settles in.",
