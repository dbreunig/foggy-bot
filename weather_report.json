    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a whisper of spritz, as a slight chance of drizzle lingers before the sun fully takes its stage. The sky, a canvas of blue sprinkled with hints of clouds, is set against the city\u2019s familiar silhouette. Highs will dance around 64 before easing into a more temperate 62, as the gentle west-southwest wind carries with it the promise of a warm afternoon, disrupted only by the occasional gust. For now, the air is crisp and invigorating, with the chance of a little sprinkle hovering around 20%. \n\nAs the day transitions into evening, clouds will weave themselves into a more prominent tapestry, overshadowing the city\u2019s cheerful expanse and hinting at the unassuming drizzles expected after 2am. Whether one takes a contemplative stroll along the waterfront or simply enjoys the quietude of a caf\u00e9, today\u2019s conditions invite soft layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a well-loved jacket\u2014to cradle against the subtle chill. The city feels both alive and tranquil, a canvas where one can find solace in everyday moments, be it savoring an artisan pastry or meandering through a sun-dappled park.",
