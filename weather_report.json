    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the cityscape, though its reach seems just shy of embracing the fog-laden horizon. Currently hovering around 66 degrees, the warmth is reassuring, though a slight cooling sweeps through as the afternoon progresses, bringing breezy whispers from the west at speeds that flirt with 21 miles per hour. This gentle wind rustles the ambitious flowers in the gardens and adds a playful touch to leisurely strolls. As the sun arches higher, the city feels vibrantly alive, yet tendrils of mist cling to the Golden Gate, hinting at the marine layer that often weaves through this iconic landscape.\n\nAs night approaches, the sky transforms into a canvas of partly cloudy hues, with temperatures gently dropping to around 54. The crisp air is inviting enough for an evening out, perhaps enjoying a quiet cup of coffee or a stroll by the waterfront, where the lapping waves harmonize with the evening's calm. Dress in layers, starting with a light sweater, perhaps a light jacket for the evening chill. This is a day best spent savoring the subtle beauty of San Francisco, finding comfort in hidden enclaves or watching the sunset paint the sky, knowing that tomorrow will bring another dance of fog and sun.",
