    "weather_report": "As the clock gently rolls into the early hours of the night, Downtown San Francisco rests under a blanket of clouds, a quiet prelude to the day ahead. The low temperature settles around 54 degrees, with a light southwestern breeze whispering through the streets. A slight chance of drizzle flirts with the possibility of moisture, but for now, the air remains crisp and still, carrying the salty tang of the sea.\n\nAwakening to Tuesday brings a soft promise of sunlight, albeit after a morning that might tease with light drizzle before 11 a.m. As the skies clear, expect a modest high of around 63, gradually giving way to a pleasant afternoon cooled by variable breezes, where gusts can reach up to 23 mph. The clouds that adorn the early skyline may give way to clearer vistas, though hints of fog may linger where the water kisses the land, transforming the day into one of refreshing beauty. A versatile wardrobe is advised; consider layers, perhaps a light jacket or sweater for the morning's chill, transitioning to something comfortably breezy as the sun rises. Ideal for an invigorating stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment in one of the city's many parks, today offers a canvas for the simple pleasures of life\u2014an afternoon spent with a book in hand or a leisurely coffee taken al fresco amidst the gentle ebb and flow of city life.",
