The streets, alive with their night rhythm, are softened by a layer of high clouds that whisper of the evening's allure. With temperatures dipping into the low fifties, a brisk west-southwest breeze lingers, offering a refreshing chill\u2014those venturing outside may want to wrap themselves in a light jacket, perhaps a well-loved sweater. The marine layer hangs delicately over the bay, hinting at fog that appears ready to tease but remains shy for now, unveiling the glowing silhouettes of the city\u2019s landmarks.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will reclaim its throne, promising a day of mostly sunny skies and moderate warmth. While temperatures begin around 66, they will taper off to a comfortable 64 by afternoon. With a reassuring southwest wind blowing gently, this is the kind of day made for leisurely strolls along neighborhood streets or quiet moments in a local caf\u00e9, sipping a warm drink while watching the world drift by. One might find the joy in a last-minute visit to a nearby park, where the remnants of a fading day blend beautifully with the soothing sounds of nature. For now, let the evening revel in its cool grace, as it transforms into a canvas streaked with possibility, restful yet full of life.",
