    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a muted atmosphere cloaks the city, reminiscent of a well-loved novel left on the shelf for too long. The day is draped in clouds, thick and unyielding, a precursory curtain drawn before the rain begins to fall. With a high flirting with the mid-sixties, the air carries the tang of moisture and a cool breeze that is altogether invigorating yet chillier than you might expect. The South Southwest wind weaves through the streets, a lively chain of whispers that dance between the buildings, while the anticipation of rain bears a certainty of 90% before the sun bids adieu.\n\nAs the day wanes into evening, the clouds will deepen, promising fresh rainfalls after the hour strikes eleven. Temperatures will gently lift to around fifty-four, hinting at the comfort of additional layers. Perhaps a light jacket and an umbrella might accompany a leisurely stroll through Washington Square, tracing the edges of the vibrant neighborhood with a warm drink in hand. While the marine layer lends a thickness to the air, obscuring the skyline in places, it also reveals a softness that beckons you to pause and savor the freshness that only city rains can summon. A quiet moment spent in the local cafe, watching the world glisten beyond the window, might just recompense for those cooler moments outside.",
