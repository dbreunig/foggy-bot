    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, the atmosphere is crisp and mostly clear, with the city\u2019s lights casting a twinkling glow against the velvety night sky. The temperature hovers comfortably in the cooler realm, gently rising as the night unfolds. A soft breeze from the north northwest adds a whisper of chill, inviting you to wrap up in a light jacket, perhaps even remembering a cozy scarf to fend off the evening's nippy embrace. \n\nAs the day breaks tomorrow, the sun will usher in a vibrant splash of warmth, illuminating the iconic city with its inviting rays. The forecast promises abundant sunshine, a refreshing change that the locals will surely welcome. Temperatures will peak near sixty-one, but a subtle decline in warmth may signal a gradual transition as afternoon approaches. For those contemplating their plans, a leisurely stroll across the Embarcadero seems fitting, or perhaps a quiet moment with a warm drink while watching the world wake up around you. The absence of fog will enhance the day's clarity, perfect for appreciating the city\u2019s stunning vistas stretching towards the Golden Gate.",
