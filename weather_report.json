    "weather_report": "As dawn lightly brushes the horizon, Downtown San Francisco stirs quietly under a mostly clear sky, suggesting a pleasant day ahead. The temperature dips around forty-six degrees, an invitation to wrap oneself in a light sweater or jacket\u2014enveloping warmth for the morning chill while remaining comfortable as the sun ascends. The gentle south winds, barely stirring at two miles per hour, carry a hint of the sea, mingling soft scents of salt and adventure.\n\nAs sunlight bathes the city, expect a cheerful embrace of warmth, climbing to the low sixties. The allure of the day beckons to those looking for simple pleasures; a stroll along the Embarcadero could evoke a sense of serenity as you watch the boats glide on shimmering waters. Alternatively, finding a cozy caf\u00e9 to sip on a warm beverage while observing the world can transform an ordinary Sunday into a cherished moment. There\u2019s an added charm to the way the city appears unclouded; although a faint marine layer spills off the shores, it does not intrude upon the beauty unfolding\u2014a perfect day for casual exploration and quiet reflection.",
