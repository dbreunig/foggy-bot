The thermometer teeters around a serene 50 degrees, cradled by a light west-southwest breeze. Each passing minute brings the promise of a day that will gradually unveil pockets of blue. By the late morning, the drizzles may dissipate, giving way to a promising expanse of sunshine by a touch before noon. The high will hover near a refreshing 64, only slipping to a subtle 62 later, inviting residents and visitors alike to sip warm beverages as they welcome the sun's soft warmth.\n\nAs you consider your attire for the day, think layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater coupled with a comfortable jacket to fend off the morning chill and that slight, lingering dampness in the air. Ideal activities might include a casual stroll along the waterfront, where the gentle waves seem to beckon, or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of brewing coffee mingles with soft conversations. As the day unfurls, the clarity will reveal the delicate charm of the city sprinkled with light, perfect for exploring hidden gems of local art or simply enjoying the rhythmic pulse of urban life.",
