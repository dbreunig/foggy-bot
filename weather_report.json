    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air holds the scent of impending drizzle, whispering a promise of soft, misty moments after 11 PM. The clouds veiling the sky create a somber but soothing backdrop, as the temperature hovers around a mild 58 degrees. Winds from the west-southwest gently stir about, occasionally picking up in vigor, adding a slight chill that calls for a light jacket or sweater. \n\nTomorrow dawns with similar hints of moisture, but the clouds will part to reveal a more cheerful sky. A warm embrace awaits with temperatures creeping toward the mid-sixties, inviting the leisurely pursuit of outdoor pleasures\u2014perhaps a stroll through one of the nearby parks or a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9. The slight chance of morning drizzle is merely a reminder of the ocean\u2019s embrace, a transient drizzle that refreshes rather than deters. As the day unfurls, the sun will beam warmly down, making way for a pleasant afternoon. A light scarf might be welcome as you venture out, but the promise of sunshine suggests wearing layers for the shifting temperatures. Overall, savor a day that combines serenity with the possibility for exploration\u2014a perfect canvas painted with the shades of San Francisco's enigmatic charm.",
