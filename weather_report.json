    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the skies are draped in a veil of clouds, intensifying the deepening shade as the evening unfolds. With a low in the mid-fifties and a brisk breeze swirling from the west-southwest at around 14 mph, the atmosphere carries a coolness that suggests layers would be prudent. Those out in the night air may find an extra sweater or jacket comforting, as the chill wraps around the shoulders like a midnight shawl.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Wednesday, expect a shift to a canvas of mostly sunny skies. The promise of brighter light dances across the day, with temperatures inching toward the mid-sixties before settling back slightly in the afternoon. The wind, a faithful companion, will gust through the streets, energizing the air with movement. In this enchanting daylight, the city may bloom with opportunities: a stroll through the lush expanses of Golden Gate Park, where nature's colors awaken; perhaps a leisurely coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, where warmth and community blend. Dress in layers to embrace the cool of the morning and the gentle embrace of the afternoon sun\u2014simple choices that allow for comfort as the day unfolds with a pleasant clarity over the iconic skyline, leaving behind any remnants of fog that linger near the coast.",
