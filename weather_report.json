    "weather_report": "As one emerges from the embrace of night, Downtown San Francisco greets the day partly clouded yet radiant, with hints of sunlight dancing gently across the streets. A soothing Southwest wind rustles through the neighborhoods, whispering tales of warmth and seasonal embrace. The temperature is poised gracefully in the mid-50s, a comfortable foundation for the day's ascent toward a pleasant high near 68. By afternoon, the sun will cast its glow, nudging temperatures slightly lower, ensuring the cool still lingers in the air.\n\nThe horizon paints a calm picture; fog blankets the hills softly, retreating as the sun's golden rays beckon. Scattered clouds drape the sky, offering a textured canvas without overwhelming the beauty below. It\u2019s a scene that invites one to step outside; perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the gentle lapping of waves harmonizes with the distant hum of city life. Layering light fabrics is advisable, a cardigan perhaps, to alternate between shades of warmth and coolness. Equip your feet for a bit of walking; today\u2019s not a day for hasty confines. Instead, embrace the outdoors with the sweet scent of salt air mingling with fresh, sun-kissed streets. It\u2019s an elegant day in the city, waiting to be savored.",
