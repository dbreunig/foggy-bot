The air is crisp and invigorating, with a gentle west wind lacing through the streets, adding a lively cadence to the day. The forecast hints at a high near 62, which suggests that, despite the warmth of the sun, a light jacket or sweater might be a wise companion for those venturing outdoors. The sky is a brilliant blue, unmarred by the usual marine layer that creeps in on lazy mornings, leaving a panorama that sparkles with possibility.\n\nAs evening approaches, the forecast offers the comfort of mostly clear skies, perfect for unwinding with a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. The sunset promises to unfurl in soft hues, making for a serene backdrop against the silhouettes of the city\u2019s alluring skyline. A gentle breeze rustles through the trees, inviting locals to partake in simple pleasures\u2014perhaps a visit to a charming caf\u00e9 or an amble through a nearby park.
