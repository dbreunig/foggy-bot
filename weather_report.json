    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this peaceful morning, Downtown San Francisco awakens under a nearly clear sky, where the silver of the city glimmers faintly in the muted light. The temperature hovers comfortably at about 51 degrees, inviting you to embrace the chill with a light sweater or a cozy shawl as you step outside. Breaths of gentle southwest wind, barely a whisper at 3 mph, stir the cool air, hinting at the warmth that awaits as the sun climbs higher.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the forecast brings a promise of sun, with temperatures expected to rise to a pleasant 70 degrees. The golden rays will soon cast shadows over the iconic skyline, warming the pavements and barely stirring the remnants of fog that cling to the horizon. The air remains crisp, and the hazy outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge suggest that the marine layer may linger offshore, a reminder of the region's unique climate. With such inviting weather, a stroll through the Mission District calls, where vibrant murals pepper the landscape, or perhaps a serene moment at one of the coffee shops lining Valencia Street, where the aromas of freshly brewed coffee waft through the air. In the embrace of this early San Francisco day, there's little to do but enjoy the simplicity of the moment, dressed for comfort and ready to savor the city's unmistakable charm.",
