    "weather_report": "As dawn edges into the waking hours, San Francisco rests beneath a quilt of gentle clouds, the remnants of an evening whispering through the night. The temperature hovers in the comfortable embrace of the low fifties, with a light breeze that stirs the stillness\u2014a soft caress from the southwest. The air is crisp yet soothing, hinting at the promise of a warm embrace later in the day.\n\nBy morning, the sun will unfurl its golden edges, illuminating the city with bright clarity. As the sun rises, expect temperatures to grace the mid-sixties, settling into a leisurely high around sixty-nine, before gently tapering off. The winds will dance between five and thirteen miles per hour, carrying whispers of warmth in bursts and hints of the ocean's breath that may break against the shores of the Golden Gate. Fog may linger in the early hours, blanketing the coast, but it will gradually yield to the sun's rays, revealing breathtaking vistas and reminding all of the city's shimmering coastlines.\n\nAs you step outside, consider a light layer\u2014a cardigan or a flattering jacket\u2014to shield against the cool air and embrace the comfort of midday warmth. Choose a pleasant walk along the waterfront, perhaps along the Embarcadero, where the gentle sound of waves mingles with the laughter of fellow early risers. Alternatively, immerse yourself in the tranquility of a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm cup of coffee as the sun breaks free. The day is poised to invite exploration\u2014be it a leisurely stroll in the park or a quiet moment of introspection among the city's historic corners.",
