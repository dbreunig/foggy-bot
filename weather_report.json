    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a tapestry of cloudiness envelops the city, whispered by a cool breeze from the west-southwest. The temperature lingers around the mild comfort of fifty-seven degrees, perfect for wrapping oneself in a light sweater, especially as gusts flirt mysteriously with the hair and the hem of your clothes. Tonight, the skyline glimmers beneath a veil of clouds, occasionally revealing pinpricks of lights that suggest life is still abustle in the dimness, an urban pulse hidden beneath weathered layers.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the clouds will part to welcome a refreshing sun, bathing the city in warmth with highs reaching near sixty-seven. As the day progresses, the chill will return, nudging temperatures back down to a comfortable sixty-five by afternoon. The wind remains a notable companion, dancing playfully and reminding everyone that while the sun may shine bright, the coastal influence ensures a lively atmosphere. With all this in mind, it\u2019s an ideal moment for a leisurely stroll through one of the many charming streets or perhaps finding solace in a cozy caf\u00e9 where one can sip a warm drink while indulging in the steady rhythm of city life.",
