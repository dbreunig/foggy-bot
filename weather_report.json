    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a soft veil of clouds embraces the city, hinting at the possibility of rain before dawn. The air is cool and holds the faint scent of approaching moisture, a gentle reminder of the Pacific's influence. With temperatures gracefully hovering around 56 degrees, the southwest winds whisper through the streets, maintaining a steady yet tender caress. Cloud cover blankets the skyline, obscuring the usually vibrant views but instilling a sense of tranquility, as the bay merges into the night. \n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the clouds will linger, shepherding in a day notable for its muted warmth and persistent grayness. The high temperature shall reach approximately 62, inviting you to reconsider layers before heading out. A light jacket or a cozy sweater would serve well against the brisk air, allowing for comfort amidst the subdued chill. The day presents an understated charm; ideal for a leisurely stroll to explore the hidden corners of the city, maybe savoring a warm beverage from a local caf\u00e9 while watching the world go by. The fog may wrap around the nearby hills, beckoning you for a quiet morning walk along the waterfront, where solitude and reflection can harmonize beautifully with the gentle rhythm of waves.",
