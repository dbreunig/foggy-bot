    "weather_report": "In the embrace of a sun-drenched morning, Downtown San Francisco awakens under a soothing blanket of cheerfully warm weather. The golden rays illuminate the cityscape, casting gentle shadows and revealing the undulating hills that cradle this vibrant metropolis. As the day unfolds, a pleasant warmth, reaching towards the high of 70, beckons residents outdoors. The breeze whispers softly from the west-southwest, offering just enough of a refreshing touch to keep spirits high without the chill that often accompanies coastal living.\n\nTonight, the city will don a more subdued robe of partly cloudy skies as temperatures retreat to a comfortable 52. The winds will continue to flirt in the gentle range of 5 to 10 mph, maintaining a sense of calm and tranquility. A fleeting marine layer lingers, though mostly absent from today\u2019s luminous skies, allowing for a clear view of iconic silhouettes\u2014like the majestic Golden Gate Bridge. For those who seek solace in the simple pleasures, a stroll along the waterfront feels remarkably inviting, where one can savor a warm cup of coffee at a quaint caf\u00e9 or enjoy the lively buzz of a village market that thrives upon the sun\u2019s glow. A light jacket may be prudent as the evening draws near, but for now, let the warmth of the day coax you into a leisurely afternoon filled with little adventures.",
