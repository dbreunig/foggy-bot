    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, a gentle warmth permeates the air as the sun casts its golden glow across the city, creating a lovely contrast against the backdrop of a mostly clear sky. While the temperature hovers around the mid-sixties, a soft breeze from the west-southwest, brisk at times, carries with it the remnants of the previous night's marine layer. The fog is not entirely absent; it lingers at the edges, retreating into the embrace of the bay and creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow over the Golden Gate.\n\nAs evening approaches, clouds will gradually take their place in the sky, lending an inviting coolness to the atmosphere, with temperatures dipping to the low fifties. On this splendid day, donning layers may be wise\u2014perhaps a light jacket for the cooler breeze once the sun dips below the horizon. Such conditions beckon a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where one might sit and savor a warm cup, taking in the city's enchanting twilight. With each moment, San Francisco unfolds its charm, inviting you to explore its hidden corners and timeless beauty.",
