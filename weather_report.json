    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle hush falls on the city bathed in a soft, tender glow from streetlights and distant buildings. The forecast for today offers a pleasant reprieve, with sunny spells yielding to rolling patches of cloud. The air is crisp, buoyed by a brisk wind that stirs the leaves without intruding on one\u2019s sense of peace. As night descends, temperatures will tiptoe upward to a mild 56 degrees, cloaked in an inviting layer of partial cloud cover. \n\nThe lingering marine layer, a soft breath from the ocean, may create delicate bands of fog along the coast, casting an ethereal quality over landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge. As you venture out, a light jacket would suffice, allowing you to wander the vibrant streets or perhaps find a cozy caf\u00e9 to enjoy a warm cup or a leisurely conversation with a friend. This delightful evening invites exploration\u2014be it a stroll along the Embarcadero or an intimate gathering with good company, encapsulating the very essence of urban life.",
