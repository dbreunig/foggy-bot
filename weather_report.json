The west wind whispers through the streets, a steady 18 mph breeze punctuated by occasional gusts, bringing the refreshing touch of a coastal night. The streets may be dark now, but the dawn promises a different story. \n\nWith the sun\u2019s ascent on the horizon, Friday unveils itself in radiant glory. A bright sun will cast its warm embrace, raising temperatures to a gentle 64 degrees, and as the afternoon wanes, expect a gradual cooling to around 62. The wind, ever-present, strengthens to a playful dance of 17 to 22 mph, echoing the sea\u2019s proximity. The likelihood of fog seems to linger at a distance, but the overall clarity enhances the striking views of the Golden Gate and beyond, presenting an idyllic opportunity for exploration. Dressed in layers\u2014a light sweater or jacket will serve well against the chill of the morning and evening. As the day unfolds, take a stroll along the waterfront or find solace in one of the quaint cafes that dot the city, basking in the warmth of coffee while the world outside settles into a vibrant Friday rhythm.",
