    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night unfolds quietly, a gentle embrace of partly cloudy skies cradling the city. The temperature hovers around a cool 48 degrees, gradually rising to a comfortable 50. A light breeze drifts from the west-northwest at about 7 mph, adding to the serene ambiance of a wintry night. While moderate cloud cover plays a subtle game with the stars, it\u2019s clear that any hint of fog is minimal, allowing the city lights to twinkle like distant constellations.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the promise of a sunny Tuesday emerges, with temperatures expected to peak at a pleasant 62 before retreating to the lower 60s by the afternoon. The northwest breeze may whip through the streets, moving briskly at 8 mph, hinting at the freshness of the day ahead. In anticipation of such clarity, layering becomes essential. A light jacket will serve well against the morning chill, while shedding it in the afternoon will reveal the warmth of the sunlight. This day leans toward the inviting, encouraging leisurely strolls along the waterfront or a quiet morning at your favorite caf\u00e9, perhaps with a book in hand, as the city awakens to the joys of a sunny embrace.",
