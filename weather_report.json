    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a gently inviting sun spills its warmth, casting a light glow upon the day as the temperature gracefully hovers near 65 degrees. The robust gusts from the west southwest, dancing at 7 to 15 mph, bring a lively energy, their whispers occasionally gusting up to 23 mph, creating a delightful interplay with the city's iconic skyline. Presently, the air remains clear, devoid of the usual fog that tends to embrace this storied locale. As the afternoon approaches, temperatures will ease down to around 63, lending a cooler touch to the air, but thankfully, the patchy clouds remain just enough to add soft contrast against the striking azure overhead.\n\nAs dusk draws near, the promise of a partly cloudy night emerges, with temperatures dipping to a comfortable 56 degrees. For those venturing out, light layers are advisable\u2014a light jacket or a cozy sweater should suffice to ward off the evening chill while allowing one to bask in the stunning views that San Francisco offers. Embrace the evening by wandering through the lively streets, perhaps soaking in the sights along the Embarcadero, or finding a quiet corner to reflect as the city begins to twinkle against the twilight sky. In this serene yet vibrant setting, the day unfolds beautifully, inviting exploration and tranquility alike.",
