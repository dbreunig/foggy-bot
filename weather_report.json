    "weather_report": "In the heart of San Francisco, the day awakens beneath a mostly sunny sky, illuminating the cityscape with a gentle warmth that belies the briskness of the west-southwest wind. As the morning unfolds, expect a high near sixty-two, supported by gusts that may stir the treetops. This is a delightful day for a leisurely stroll, perhaps alongside the Embarcadero, where the bay breeze meets the sun-drenched pavement, offering a refreshing reminder that this city breathes both fog and light.\n\nTonight, the clouds will gather softly, wrapping the area in a light veil, as temperatures dip to a comfortable fifty-three. While the marine layer may dance playfully, it should not overshadow the serenity of the evening. As dusk approaches, a light jacket will provide just the right amount of comfort against the evening chill. Consider embracing the moment by visiting a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh brews invites good conversation or introspection. Whether you choose to wander among the bustling streets or retreat to the warmth of home, the city is alive with understated beauty today.",
