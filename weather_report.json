The air carries with it a faint haze, a whisper of marine influence, hinting at the potential for a delicate drizzle later tonight. The temperature is a mild 56 degrees, cushioned by a west-southwest wind that breathes gently at times but swells into gusts, carrying a refreshing coolness along its path. The evening, though cloaked in cloud cover, offers a subtle charm, perfect for those meandering through lantern-lit streets or perhaps savoring a warm brew at a local caf\u00e9.\n\nAs dawn's light unfurls over Wednesday, the city awakens with a slight chance of morning drizzle before giving way to a gentle embrace of sun peeking through the retreating clouds. The expected high dances around 64, allowing the chill of the morning to gradually yield to a more inviting warmth in the afternoon. Attire should strike a balance\u2014light layers are essential, providing comfort against the remnants of cool air while remaining versatile for the fleeting bursts of sunlight. Whether it\u2019s a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero, visiting artisan shops, or simply finding a cozy nook to read, the day presents itself as an intriguing tapestry woven with possibilities amidst the gentle rhythms of urban life.",
