    "weather_report": "Under the delicate embrace of a sun-drenched afternoon, Downtown San Francisco reveals its charm in crystalline clarity. The golden light spills over the cityscape, casting playful shadows while the gentle rustle of the west wind dances through the streets at a brisk 18 miles per hour. With temperatures hovering near 60 degrees, the air feels invigorating, perfect for an afternoon stroll or an outdoor caf\u00e9 moment. As the day softens into twilight, you may notice the evening coaxing in a few more clouds, yet the presence of low-lying fog, that enigmatic marine layer, lingers only at the edges, leaving the city's vibrant colors unmasked.\n\nAs the sun dips lower in the sky, the temperature is expected to cool further, settling comfortably around the mid-50s. For those planning to venture out tonight, layering becomes a quaint necessity\u2014a light sweater or jacket will serve as a reliable companion against the evening chill. This splendid weather invites one to embrace the simple pleasures of city life: perhaps a leisurely wander through a bustling market, a quiet moment in a neighborhood park, or the delight of discovering a cozy bookshop adorned with local treasures. As you navigate the streets, take a moment to breathe in the salty air carried from the bay\u2014it's a reminder of the unique beauty that defines this city by the sea.",
