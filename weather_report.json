    "weather_report": "As the evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a gentle chill sweeps through the air, inviting residents to wrap themselves in layers. The forecast speaks of a partly cloudy night, with temperatures settling around a cool 51 degrees. A light southwest breeze adds a whisper of crispness, hinting at the city's proximity to the restless ocean. The current view from the heights reveals a delicate marine layer, softening the sharp edges of the horizon and cloaking the city in a light veil of fog that drapes the Golden Gate Bridge and the hills beyond.\n\nCome morning, the skies are expected to brighten into a mostly sunny tableau, though the air will remain invigoratingly cool, peaking at around 64 degrees. One might choose to slip on a light jacket or a cozy sweater, perfect for an afternoon stroll through the neighborhood or a casual coffee on a sun-drenched patio. As the city's vibrant rhythm unfolds, the weather invites outdoor exploration\u2014perhaps a visit to the iconic Ferry Building, where the morning's market buzzes with activity, or a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the gentle lapping of the bay serenades the senses. With the promise of clearer skies over the mountains and the clinging fog dissipating, it\u2019s a splendid day to embrace the city\u2019s eclectic charm without feeling overwhelmed by the briskness of the air.",
