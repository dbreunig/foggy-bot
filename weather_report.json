    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp and refreshing with a promise of clarity. The sun, a gentle companion, casts its warmth as the temperature hovers just above sixties, gradually settling into a comfortable 60 degrees. A westward breeze, at times robust, dances through the streets at eighteen miles per hour, occasionally gusting up to twenty-three, adding a vibrant energy to the day. While the sky enjoys a mostly sunny disposition, delicate clouds float lazily across the horizon, a reminder of the marine layer's lingering presence, but the cityscape shines through without restriction, particularly toward the Golden Gate.\n\nAs the sun prepares to dip into the evening, the weather remains subtle and inviting. With temperatures cooling down to around fifty-one, a light jacket will keep you in comfortable spirits as the night draws near. For those seeking a leisurely afternoon, consider a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the cool breeze mingles with the scent of the sea, or find a cozy caf\u00e9 in which to sip a warming brew while watching the world go by. The conditions allow for simple pleasures\u2014a book read under the sun or a quiet moment in a park, enjoying the serene dance of the day sliding into twilight.",
