    "weather_report": "In this quiet hour before dawn, the air over Downtown San Francisco carries the faint promise of drizzle, a gentle but persistent reminder of the cooler days that often sweep in from the bay. With the temperature lingering near 56 degrees, the west-southwest breeze murmurs through the city at about seven miles per hour, rustling the leaves and beckoning an air of serene anticipation. The clouds bob above, thick and soft like a gray blanket gently thrown over the landscape, hinting at the patchy drizzle that might grace the sidewalks just before dawn breaks. \n\nAs the sun stretches over the horizon tomorrow, the forecast promises a mix of clouds and golden rays struggling to shine through, leading to an enjoyable day that peaks around 64 degrees. The wind will pick up just enough to tousle hair and scarves, with gusts reaching for 21 miles per hour, breathing life into the coolness. Those heading out would do well to wear layers: a light jacket over a breathable top, perhaps even a sturdy pair of shoes for that touch of city wandering. With such atmospherics, a stroll through the less crowded streets or a quiet coffee at a corner caf\u00e9 would suit the day perfectly\u2014embracing the city's cool charm while the sky shifts from gray to vibrant hues, a humble homage to the beauty of an evolving view against this grand urban backdrop.",
