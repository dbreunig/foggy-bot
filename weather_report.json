    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, one encounters a bright yet mild canvas, where the sun graces the skyline with a gentle warmth, reaching highs near 65 degrees. The afternoon will usher in a subtle chill as temperatures dip to around 62. A steady west-southwest breeze, brisk at 14 to 20 mph, encourages a slight rustle among the treetops, contributing to the invigorating atmosphere of the day. Despite the sun's presence, there is a veil of clarity, offering a glimpse of the iconic landmarks while hinting at the omnipresent, elusive marine layer that can crawl back over the bay as the evening descends.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the skies will transition to a mostly cloudy embrace, with lows settling around 55 degrees. The wind will calm, becoming less boisterous but still present, wrapping the evening in a cool, soft layer. For those venturing outside, a light jacket will suffice, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or an exploration of the city's charming nooks and crannies. Dining al fresco or indulging in a cozy caf\u00e9 in the neighborhood beckons, enhanced by the crisp air. The week is still young; the city invites you to relish in its understated elegance this afternoon.",
