    "weather_report": "As the night waxes on over Downtown San Francisco, one can sense the somber embrace of the marine layer, cloaking the city in a cool, silken veil. The forecast hints at a chance of rain, suggesting that the heavens might soon weep. With cloud cover thickening and winds gently stirring from the south, the air carries a richness, almost an anticipation of what is to come. Temperatures linger at a mild 55 degrees, inviting a light jacket to ward off the briskness, particularly as the first hints of dawn approach.\n\nTomorrow uncovers an expectation of persistent rain, with temperatures likely to hover around 61 before yielding to a cooler 59 in the afternoon. As the city awakens, wrapped in this quietude, one might contemplate the existential beauty of rainy days. Indoor pursuits offer a warmth and comfort; a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 could offer refuge, perhaps even a moment to savor the simple pleasure of steaming coffee in hand. Alternatively, exploring eclectic bookshops or marveling at the city's art spaces can transform the drizzly backdrop into a canvas of inspiration, while the pitter-patter of raindrops against windows adds a rhythm to the day. As the sky greets the dawn, dress comfortably\u2014layer up, for the chill lingers, and let the enchantment of a rainy San Francisco unfold.",
