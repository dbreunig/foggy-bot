    "weather_report": "A night cloaked in calmness blankets Downtown San Francisco, with the air remarkably clear, inviting an evening stroll through the illuminated streets. The coolness brushes against your skin, heralding a low temperature of about 44 degrees. As the gentle winds weave through city blockades, one might find tranquility in the space between thoughts while walking along the marina or perhaps enjoying a quiet moment at a favorite caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink.\n\nLooking ahead, the day promises a gentle shift. Rain is likely to make its entrance post five in the evening, though it seems prepared to arrive softly, with expectations of minimal accumulation. The morning sunlight will dance intermittently with the clouds, allowing for a brief flirtation with brightness before the sky dons a grayish cloak. As daylight unfurls, a light sweater or a layered jacket would serve as prudent companions, accommodating the fluctuating temperatures as the day progresses toward evening.\n\nWhen the rain approaches later, seek refuge in local museums or galleries, where the art can serve as a conversation piece amid the patter of rain outside. A bookshop might beckon, inviting an exploration of stories that transport you beyond the confines of the storm. This Tuesday offers a humble charm; whether by the shores or amid the city's heart, the simple pleasures await an unfolding day.",
