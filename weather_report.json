The temperature dips to a mild 53 degrees, accompanied by a brisk west-southwest wind that dances through the streets at about 16 mph, pushing the day closer to its sunlit potential. As the morning stretches into afternoon, expect the sun to push through the clouds, offering a tentative warmth with a high of 61 degrees. The breeze will pick up, escorting occasional gusts that may flirt with 28 mph, playfully rustling the leaves and clothing of those venturing outdoors.\n\nThe day unfolds with a tranquil clarity, although the marine layer lingers in the distance, hinting at a lingering presence of fog that remains more spectral than imposing. Those in search of outdoor activities should seize this moment to explore quieter pathways or perhaps enjoy a reflective stroll by the bay, where the cool air mingles with the warmth of the sun, creating an inviting atmosphere for contemplation. Dressing in layers would be wise\u2014an adaptable ensemble to navigate the cool morning and give way to the brisk energy of the afternoon. With the weather set to become more pleasant, securing a cozy caf\u00e9 spot or visiting a local bookstore might just be the remedy for an easygoing midweek charm.",
