    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night envelopes the city in a gentle shroud of clouds, the air cool and tinged with the scent of salt from the nearby bay. The temperature hovers around a mild fifty-four degrees, accompanied by a soft breeze whispering at seven miles per hour. As dawn approaches, a quiet anticipation brews, promising a transition into a day where the sun will reclaim its territory, casting warmth over the iconic skyline.\n\nBy midday, expect the clouds to relent and yield to a mostly sunny disposition, as temperatures rise to about sixty-four before gently settling into the afternoon at sixty-two. The west-southwest winds will steadily pick up, occasionally gusting up to eighteen miles per hour, dancing through the streets with a refreshing vigor. Despite the promise of sunshine, a hint of the ever-present marine layer may linger, particularly near the coast, adding a layer of mystique to the Golden Gate Bridge and hinting at the city's notorious fog. In light of this brisk but pleasant weather, dressing in layers is prudent; a light jacket during the cooler morning hours will give way to a more comfortable attire as the sun makes its appearance. Today is ripe for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to the local cafes, where you can savor your morning coffee while soaking in the city's ambiance, your jacket draped casually over your arm as the day unfolds.",
