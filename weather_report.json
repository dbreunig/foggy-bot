    "weather_report": "The night unfolds quietly above Downtown San Francisco, a gentle breeze swirling in from the west while the city slumbers beneath a mostly clear sky. As dawn approaches, temperatures linger comfortably at around 61 degrees, inviting a soothing stillness that hints at promise. The marine layer has yet to reclaim the streets, leaving the iconic skyline illuminated only by the muted glow of city lights against a backdrop of black velvet.\n\nCome Tuesday, the sun will rise triumphantly, bestowing a warm embrace upon the city. With temperatures nudging up towards the high seventies and dipping slightly in the afternoon, the day looks to be a picture of pleasantness, free from the fog that often loiters offshore. Residents will find solace in light attire; perhaps a lightweight shirt accompanied by a cardigan for when the sea breeze begins to dance in the afternoon. It\u2019s a perfect occasion for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps to indulge in the local flavors at a street-side caf\u00e9, or for an early afternoon visit to one of the charming boutiques that dot the nearby neighborhoods. As the daylight wanes, one might find contentment in the simple act of watching the sun set behind the Golden Gate, casting a warm blush over the storied hills and bustling streets below.",
