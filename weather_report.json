    "weather_report": "As the sun graces Downtown San Francisco with its understated warmth today, a gentle breeze sweeps in from the west, bringing a refreshing embrace to the air. With a high of 62 degrees, the day presents a canvas painted with clarity and tranquility, although the surrounding coastal fog still lies in wait, veiling the edges of the Golden Gate Bridge. You may notice patches of shimmering light where the sun pierces through, but the marine layer lingers close, just a whisper away, painting a soft, heavenly glow over the hills and rooftops.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the skies will remain mostly clear, inviting one to bask in the calm evening air or perhaps take a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. The evening's low settling around 51 degrees suggests a light wrap may be prudent for those choosing to linger outdoors. Think lightly layered attire, with a soft sweater or light jacket to fend off any evening chill. Today is perfect for taking a scenic drive along the coast, visiting a quaint caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or simply savoring the gentle rhythm of city life in this splendid May atmosphere.",
