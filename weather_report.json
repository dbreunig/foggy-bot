With such clarity, it\u2019s a splendid day for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to one of the insightful art exhibits dotting the cityscape. Dress casually but bring a light layer for when the sun dips, as the air will turn crisp, making a cozy caf\u00e9 or an intimate bookshop the perfect refuge to unwind and bask in the serenity of the evening.",
