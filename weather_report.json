    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the night, Downtown San Francisco sleeps beneath a sky that hints at the morning sun's eventual rise. The air is cool, filled with a gentle breeze whispering through the city\u2019s palms. As the hours inch toward dawn, temperatures settle around a pleasant 52 degrees, making for a serene, albeit brisk, atmosphere for those awake to savor the quiet. The forecast promises a delightful Sunday, with the clouds retreating to unveil a clear expanse and warmth creeping in, set to reach about 64 degrees by day\u2019s peak.\n\nAs the illuminated buildings gleam against the dark canvas of night, one can anticipate the lifting marine layer that cloaks the Golden Gate Bridge, hinting at a day characterized by clarity and sunshine. The air, seldom heavy with fog, invites the city to breathe freely. Today seems ideal for leisurely wanderings; perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the bay glistens, or uncovering the treasures of the local art scene. Layers are advisable, a stylish, light jacket will do well against the crisp breeze that will nudge its way through the day. Adventure awaits in those winding streets, beckoning the curious to step outside and embrace the beauty of early summer in the city.",
