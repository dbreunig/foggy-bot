As twilight draws near, a blanket of clouds obscures the sun's departure, offering a soft, muted palette that can feel both inviting and introspective.\n\nLooking toward tomorrow, the forecast promises a transformation as the sun emerges, casting golden rays over the city by midday, with a high near a pleasant 65. The southwest winds will remain a steady companion, ensuring a fresh, invigorating air throughout the day. While the fog may linger over the Golden Gate, perhaps teasing a hint of its ghostly presence in the early hours, clarity will undoubtedly win out as the day unfolds. \n\nIn this unfolding scenario, the choice of attire becomes both practical and thoughtful\u2014layers are the way to go. A light jacket will serve well against the evening chill, but come morning, a simple shirt with a cardigan can be the right balance for comfort while exploring.
