    "weather_report": "Today, Downtown San Francisco greets you with sunny warmth, though as the hours stretch, the afternoon will usher in a gradual cooling. Expect gentle winds from the west-southwest, mingling with the air and bringing a delightful vibrancy to the day. While the morning sun paints the cityscape in bright strokes, keep an eye on the skies; the promise of a partly cloudy evening hints at a soft transition as the day dips into twilight.\n\nAs for fog, the presence of a marine layer may linger in the distance, shrouding the bridge and the coast in a subtle veil, whispering reminders of the sea. This creates an ethereal backdrop that elegantly contrasts the city\u2019s vibrancy. Dress in light layers, perhaps a light jacket to guard against the evening chill, allowing for comfort when the sunshine gives way to cooler temperatures later. An ideal afternoon may be spent exploring the nearby parks, grabbing a coffee at a quaint caf\u00e9, or simply enjoying the melodic hum of city life from a cozy spot where you can take in the panorama.",
