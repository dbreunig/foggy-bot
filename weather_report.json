A west-southwest wind carries a refreshing breath, dancing through the streets at about 12 mph. Yet, as the sun inches toward the horizon, a familiar marine layer cloaks portions of the city, draping itself over the Golden Gate with a whisper of fog. This is a quintessential San Francisco scene, where the clarity of the day offers glimpses of vibrant city life beneath a unique tapestry of cloud and light.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the clouds will deepen, blanketing the skyline with a mostly cloudy embrace, lowering the temperature to about 50 degrees. It\u2019s a time for cozy layers\u2014a light jacket or a soft scarf would be ideal companions against the subtle chill that often seeps through the evening air. The lingering fog hints at adventure; a stroll along the Embarcadero, or perhaps a quiet moment in a caf\u00e9 nestled among friends\u2014a perfect opportunity to share stories while watching the dance of lights across the bay. Tonight, the city invites you to linger, to appreciate the beauty of its ethereal quality, as the fog rolls in softly, settling down over the familiar streets.",
