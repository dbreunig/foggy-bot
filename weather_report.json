    "weather_report": "As night drapes its velvety fabric over Downtown San Francisco, the air is pregnant with the promise of rain, anticipated to arrive shortly after the clock strikes eleven. With the mercury settling around a cool 49 degrees, the atmosphere feels refreshingly crisp, invigorated by the south-southwest winds that whisper at a gentle 6 to 15 mph. The clouds, thick and brooding, gather above, setting the stage for the evening's impending showers. The likelihood of rain sits comfortably at 90%, with hopes of a light drizzle to come, perhaps just enough to wash away the dust of the day.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the weather will remain overcast, the sun hesitant to break through the thick sheet of gray. The high will barely scrape 60, accompanied once again by gusty winds, making it an uninviting companion for outdoor pursuits. With such conditions, dressing in layers, including a waterproof jacket and sturdy footwear, will be essential for those who venture out. A quiet day in the city might include a stroll through nearby museums or galleries, where the art serves as a cozy refuge from the damp chill. Alternatively, one might settle into a caf\u00e9, warming up with a favorite brew while watching the rain dance against the window, a perfect setting for introspection or leisurely conversation. Such is the welcome charm of San Francisco, where even the gloom has its own delicate beauty.",
