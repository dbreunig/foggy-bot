    "weather_report": "In the embrace of the evening, Downtown San Francisco finds itself cloaked in a shroud of cloudiness, with the temperature hovering around a mild 57 degrees. The gentle, westerly breeze whispers through the streets at about 7 to 10 miles per hour, lending a soothing touch to the air. As night unfolds its velvet cloak, the skies remain vast yet muted, with the promise of more luminous vistas beckoning for tomorrow.\n\nAs dawn approaches, a transformation awaits. On Thursday, the clouds will recede, allowing the sun to bathe the city in warmth, reaching a comfortable high of 65 degrees. The winds will pick up slightly, stirring with the southwest at 6 to 14 miles per hour, punctuated by occasional gusts. The prospect of a mostly sunny day teases the senses, hinting at clear horizons and radiant skies. While the evening\u2019s fog softly cradles the shore, it will retreat, revealing the city's charm in all its brightness.\n\nFor those planning their attire, layers are key, gracefully accommodating the transition from the coolness of night to the gentle warm embrace of the midday sun. An adaptable light jacket, perhaps, paired with comfortable shoes, suggests readiness for wandering through open spaces or indulging in the hidden corners of the city. With such inviting conditions on the horizon, one might consider an afternoon stroll along the Embarcadero, or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the ebb and flow of the crowd mingles harmoniously with the day's promises.",
