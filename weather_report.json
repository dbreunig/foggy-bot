    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco finds itself in the embrace of a balmy afternoon, where the sun casts its gentle light across the streets, warming the air to a comfortable 66 degrees. The vibrant blue sky is only occasionally interrupted by the wisps of cloud, a precursor to the evening\u2019s quiet transition into partly cloudy twilight. As the day wanes, the temperature will gracefully descend, creating a cozy atmosphere that hovers around 54 degrees at night. The west wind, a steady companion at about 21 mph, carries with it a refreshing crispness, occasionally gusting to remind us of its spirited nature.\n\nWhile the iconic Golden Gate Bridge may be concealed in a light haze, the day remains clear enough to revel in the beauty of the city. The soft marine layer, while persistent, does not steal the charm of this San Francisco afternoon; rather, it lends an ethereal quality to the horizon. Dressing in layers is prudent today\u2014a light jacket over a comfortable top will suffice, allowing one to adapt to the gentle shifts in temperature. As dusk approaches and the city lights begin to twinkle, finding solace in a quaint caf\u00e9 or meandering through local artisan shops will perfectly complement the serene ambiance of the evening.",
