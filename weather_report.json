    "weather_report": "A veil of clouds gently blankets Downtown San Francisco this morning, lending a somber charm to the skyline. The day begins mostly sunny in the sense of hope, though that promising light may struggle to pierce through the haze as afternoon approaches. While the temperature hovers around the low sixties, a southwest breeze dances lightly through the streets, a reminder of spring\u2019s tenderness amidst the lingering chill.\n\nAs evening descends, expect a further softening of clarity, with clouds thickening and temperatures dipping to that comforting wrap of fifty degrees. The marine layer, ever the sly visitor from the Pacific, finds itself lurking over the bay, possibly casting a shroud over familiar landmarks like the Golden Gate. For now, the waterfront glistens as a sight to behold; it's a day for warm jackets, perhaps layered over a sweater, and a cozy scarf might not go amiss as you stroll along the Embarcadero. A gentle walk or a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 beckons, where one might linger over a warm drink, savoring the moment while the clouds gather, crafting the perfect backdrop for a peaceful day in the city.",
