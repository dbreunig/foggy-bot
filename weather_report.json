    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, this morning dawns with bright sun spilling across the skyline, a refreshing promise of clarity in the crisp air. The high today is expected to settle near 65 degrees, inviting you to relish the day as temperatures gradually retreat to a more mellow 62 this afternoon. A gentle breeze from the south-southwest, whispering between 3 and 10 mph, brings a light touch that complements the delightful warmth of the sun. Despite the lovely conditions, shadows stir beneath the Marin headlands, hinting at the subtle presence of a marine layer nearby. It\u2019s there, just beyond sight, hinting at the ever-elusive fog that characterizes this city.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect a transition to a tranquil night marked by mostly clear skies and a low of around 50 degrees. This is an evening for walks along the Embarcadero or perhaps a leisurely meal at one of the local bistros, where the warmth of the culinary offerings will be embraced against the mild chill. Dressing in layers is advisable; start with a light, breathable top and add a cozy jacket for the evening\u2019s coolness. Take the opportunity to savor a moment outdoors, whether it is sipping coffee as the sun sets or contemplating the lights twinkling against the bay, for these simple pleasures weave together the fabric of San Francisco living.",
