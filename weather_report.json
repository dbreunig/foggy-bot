    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun casts its golden hue over Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in clear skies and a lively breeze. Temperatures hover around a comfortable 63 degrees, promising a pleasant afternoon as they gently descend towards a more mellow 60. The westward winds dance through the streets at about 25 mph, occasionally gusting even stronger, coaxing the leaves into a spirited rustle and hinting at the coastal energy that defines this vibrant locale. While the forecasted marine layer appears tamed today, the distant hills may hint at the ocean's lingering coolness, though the view remains unmarred by fog and the horizon stretches tantalizingly clear.\n\nAs twilight approaches, clouds will start to weave through the twilight fabric, yielding a low of about 50 degrees that urges you to layer up. With the refreshing wind continuing its playful nudge, a light jacket or sweater will serve you well should you decide to wander about, perhaps along one of the countless scenic streets or waterfront paths. The evening remains perfect for a leisurely stroll to savor the softening light on the bay and the glimmering reflections on the water. As the sun dips, consider unwinding at a cozy caf\u00e9 or enjoying a quiet moment in a park, surrendering to the city\u2019s charm as it gracefully transitions into night.",
