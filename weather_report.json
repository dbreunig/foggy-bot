    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun bathes Downtown San Francisco in a soft golden light, soothing the bustling city with a promise of warmth. As the temperature hovers pleasantly around 67 degrees, a gentle westward breeze stirs the air, providing a refreshing contrast to the sun's embrace. With clear views extending toward the Golden Gate, the day carries a serene clarity, unobscured by fog or the teasing tendrils of a marine layer. As twilight approaches, the palette shifts to deeper hues, hinting at the cooler night ahead, where temperatures dip towards a comfortable 57 degrees. \n\nDressing in layers is advisable; a light sweater or jacket offers just the right touch of comfort for evening outings while embracing the lingering warmth of the sun for afternoon strolls. As the city quiets toward nightfall, consider a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering reflections of lights dance upon the bay's surface, or perhaps an early dinner at a quaint caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating, allowing the soft, crisp wind to serenade you as day transitions seamlessly into night.",
