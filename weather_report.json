    "weather_report": "As night settles softly over downtown San Francisco, a gentle embrace of clouds hangs in the air like a light curtain, hinting at the possibility of a drizzle that may sneak in after the witching hour. The temperature hovers comfortably around the mid-50s, inviting a light jacket to ward off any lingering coolness stirred by the west-southwest wind. The promise of tomorrow brings a slight chance of early morning drizzle that will shy away, unveiling mostly sunny skies by afternoon. Expect a high of around 64, but as the day progresses, temperatures will gradually retreat, escorting the warmth of the sun into the shadows.\n\nThe current atmosphere suggests a subdued elegance, with fog dancing along the waterways and creeping into the crevices of the city. It\u2019s a time when the marine layer cloaks the silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge, creating an ethereal backdrop against the shimmering lights of the city. Dress in layers; perhaps a soft sweater under a light jacket will suffice, allowing you to embrace the day with comfort and style. For those unperturbed by the cooler evening air, an after-dinner walk along the Embarcadero would be delightful; the waterfront reflecting the city lights offers a rare tranquility before the bustling day unfolds anew. Whether savoring a warm drink on a subdued caf\u00e9 patio or seeking the warmth of a friend\u2019s company, the temperature and conditions invite quiet reflection amid the beauty of a San Francisco summer night.",
