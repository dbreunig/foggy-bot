    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun blesses the city with a gentle warmth, illuminating the iconic skyline and casting glittering reflections upon the bay. With temperatures hovering near the low sixties, the air is refreshingly crisp, inviting a pleasant wander along the waterfront or a casual stroll through the verdant parks. The west-northwest breeze dances lightly through the streets, offering just enough of a chill to coax the layered look from an eager wardrobe. \n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will remain mostly clear, with temperatures dipping into the mid-forties. This transition calls for a light jacket as the night delivers a cool embrace, and perhaps a walk along the Embarcadero would be a fitting way to enjoy the serene views of the moonlit waters. There\u2019s no fog to obscure the horizon but a hint of the marine layer lingers\u2014promising crisp, coastal air. With such clarity overhead, it seems a perfect time to sip on coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, surrounded by the soft buzz of city life, while watching the sun slowly dip beyond the Golden Gate.",
