Currently, the temperature hovers around a crisp 47 degrees, inviting those who venture outdoors to wrap themselves in light layers. The shadows stretch long, casting an enchanting contrast between the lingering light of day and the deepening night. \n\nTomorrow, anticipation hangs in the air for a transition to mostly sunny conditions as the sun reaches its zenith, peaking near 63 degrees before yielding to a cooler afternoon of around 59. This gradual warming blend promises a pleasant, albeit breezy, day, where the north-northwest winds might playfully tousle one\u2019s hair. The marine layer, often a playful visitor to the city, may linger at the edges yet is unlikely to shroud the iconic skyline for long. \n\nFor those among you seeking evening pleasures, consider a leisurely stroll through the vibrant streets, perhaps indulging in a warm cup of coffee or tea, or gathering with friends under the twinkling lights. Expect charm from the city\u2019s bustling caf\u00e9s and the community vibe that fills the air. Dress comfortably but warmly, and lean into the crispness of the evening\u2014a light jacket is a prudent companion.",
