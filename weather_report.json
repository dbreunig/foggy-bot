Gusts, bold yet playful, may catch your hat\u2014a reminder that even in this serene setting, Mother Nature has her moods.\n\nAs evening descends, expect clouds to gather subtly, casting a soft shadow against twilight. The forecast speaks of patchy drizzle after midnight, a tender kiss from the moisture-laden air, though the chance remains slight, leaving room for an ultimately gentle night. With temperatures dipping to a mild 57 degrees, a light jacket will suffice; perhaps a favorite scarf for comfort, as the chill bites softly in the shadows. Such a day invites leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9, where one can sip warm coffee and watch the city transition from day to night.",
