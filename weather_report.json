The air is imbued with a coolness, holding onto the overnight chill, which has settled around 53 degrees. The muted colors of the morning hint at a day that will blossom slowly; expect the fog to recede, though the clouds will hang about, casting a diffuse light across the city.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, temperatures will rise but remain comfortably cool, peaking around 61 degrees before the afternoon brings a slight drop, settling near 58. It\u2019s a day ripe for layers\u2014consider a light sweater or jacket to stave off the briskness, particularly in the transition from the cozy indoors to the cool embrace of the streets. The atmosphere invites a leisurely day spent exploring local cafes or perhaps strolling through the quieter neighborhoods, where the fog drapes like a timeless shawl. A quiet afternoon in a bookshop or a visit to a hidden gallery could be just the remedy for the soul, as the city reveals its quieter charm through shifting veils of fog and cloud.",
