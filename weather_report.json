    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the skies unfurl a brilliant tapestry of sunshine, teasing the promise of a warm afternoon. With temperatures hovering around a pleasant 72, the day calls for a light, breathable attire; perhaps a soft linen shirt paired with comfortable trousers, ensuring freedom of movement as you wander through the vibrant streets. The gentle caress of a west-southwest breeze\u2014picking up momentum to 21 mph\u2014adds a refreshing element, encouraging leisurely strolls past the charming cafes and art-filled alleyways.\n\nAs you gaze out over the cityscape, the clarity is undeniable; the horizon stretches wide, the Golden Gate Bridge proudly piercing through the radiant blue. However, a hint of the enduring marine layer can be spotted, whispering its lurking presence in pockets near the bridge, a reminder of the ocean's embrace that often dances with the city's weather. Tonight, as the sun dips below the horizon, expect a mellow chill, calling for a light jacket, especially under the fading light when temperatures will retreat to a cozy 58. A perfect evening would find you perhaps enjoying a quiet dinner in a quaint bistro, watching the twilight envelop the iconic skyline as you relish the cheerful buzz of the city winding down.",
