    "weather_report": "As night cloaks Downtown San Francisco, the sky wears a gentle shroud of cloud cover, holding a low around 47 degrees. A light breeze whispers through, barely disturbing the calm. The forecast offers a promise of a mostly sunny Saturday, where temperatures will hover near 63, slipping to a cooler 59 as the afternoon wanes. Currently, the clarity of the evening hints at a marine layer lurking nearby, though it remains elusive. The fog does not drape the city tonight, allowing the faint glow of lights to twinkle like starlight scattered on an urban canvas.\n\nAs you prepare for the evening ahead, think layers. A light jacket will serve you well against the coolness, perhaps accompanied by a soft scarf if you linger longer outdoors. The serenity of this evening beckons you to stroll along the waterfront or enjoy a quiet cup of tea in a cozy caf\u00e9, free from the usual bustle. Embrace the stillness, and let the city's lingering charm wash over you.",
