    "weather_report": "As the sun dips toward the horizon, Downtown San Francisco basks in the embrace of a pristine afternoon. Warm rays spill over the iconic skyline, their brilliance intensified by the crisp, fresh air that dances through the streets. A gentle west-southwest wind, brisk but invigorating, carries with it whispers of the ocean, teasing the edges of the city. Despite the mild high of 66 degrees, the atmosphere is lively, with the energy of a city in motion\u2014people meander, enjoying the almost-comforting warmth, seeking out pockets of sunlight that drench the pavement.\n\nAs night approaches, the clarity of the day hints at a charming twilight, with mostly clear skies and a soft breeze winding down. A low of 58 beckons those out for evening strolls, yet the fresh air may nudge you toward a light jacket or a comfortable sweater, perfect for tender late-night conversations in cozy cafes or under the swaying branches of city trees. The promise of an idyllic evening lies ahead\u2014one that invites a quiet exploration, perhaps a visit to your favorite perch for rooftop views, or a seat by a window, mug in hand, savoring the city\u2019s heartbeat as it transitions from day to night.",
