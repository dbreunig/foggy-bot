    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night descends with a softness that hints at tranquility. The air is clear and crisp, whispering of a pleasant morning ahead, as the stars begin to fade, making way for another bright day. As dawn approaches, temperatures will dip to a comfortable 56 degrees, carried on gentle winds from the west-southwest. \n\nAs the sun breaks through the horizon, a promising warmth will envelope the city, ushering in a sunny Saturday. With the mercury expected to rise to a near-perfect 73 degrees, the day will feel inviting yet relaxed, encouraging a lightness in both dress and spirit. Fog, that familiar coastal companion, is absent tonight, leaving the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge bathed in clarity, unclouded by the usual marine layer that often sweeps in. This morning is ideal for leisurely strolls through local parks, perhaps stopping for a coffee and a moment to savor the crisp air. A light sweater may suffice for the earlier hours, but as the sun climbs higher, lighter layers will keep you comfortable in the growing warmth. Consider a visit to the Ferry Building Marketplace; there, you might enjoy the vibrant atmosphere and local delicacies, all set against the stunning backdrop of a city awakening to the day.",
