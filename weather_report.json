    "weather_report": "As dawn creeps over Downtown San Francisco, a soft veil of clouds blankets the city, lending a muted intimacy to the urban landscape. The cool air, lingering around 50 degrees, is buoyed by a westward breeze that whispers through the streets, occasionally kicking up gentle gusts. While the cheerful sun is expected to make a fleeting appearance today, its warmth may feel scattered, peeking briefly through the clouds to elevate the high temperature to a cool 58 before settling into a brisk 56 by afternoon.\n\nThe typical fog that often enchants the bay is noticeably absent for now, replaced by a shroud of low cloud cover that adds a contemplative air to the day. This is not a day for sunbathing or strolling in shorts and sandals; rather, a light jacket or layered sweater would serve you well as you navigate the charming streets. The subtle charm of the city invites leisurely pursuits\u2014perhaps a warm cup of coffee at your favorite caf\u00e9, where you can watch the world unfold, or browsing the unique shops that call this vibrant area home. With a hint of sun and a whisper of wind, today beckons you to enjoy the calm rhythm of a San Francisco morning, where the promise of a brighter afternoon lies just beyond the horizon.",
