    "weather_report": "The dawn breaks gently over Downtown San Francisco, with clouds draping the sky in a soft, gray blanket. A lingering hint of drizzle weaves through the air, adding a touch of moisture to the cool morning. As the day unfolds, a flicker of promise emerges\u2014by mid-morning, the clouds are expected to retreat, revealing elongated stretches of blue sky. The temperatures will rise around the mid-60s, ushering in a warmth just shy of outright summer brilliance. An invigorating west-southwest breeze sweeps through the city, rustling leaves and filling coastal air with a hint of salt.\n\nFog creeps softly at the edges of the sylvan hills and might cast a gentle embrace toward the ocean, signaling the subtle dance of the marine layer. As the sun climbs higher, the fog should recede, yielding clearer vistas. An ideal day calls for a light jacket in the morning, perfect for strolling along the Embarcadero as the city begins to pulsate with life. A late-morning visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of coffee would harmonize well with the brisk air, while an afternoon walk could reveal the kaleidoscope of colors as the sun mingles with the urban landscape. Today is ripe for quiet exploration\u2014be it a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park or a reflective moment atop a scenic overlook as the city awakens.",
