The city, nestled among its undulating hills, is quiet, preparing for the sun's ascent. As the day unfurls, the clouds will yield to mostly sunny conditions, ushering in a high near 67\u2014a pleasant warmth that may soften to about 65 as the afternoon wanes. Calm winds from the west-southwest will stir to a light 2 to 14 mph, enhancing the gentle hum of urban life.\n\nWhile fog may still cling to the edges of the bay, creating a dreamy haze around the Golden Gate, the clarity gradually improves as the sunlight breaks through. A light jacket or layers will suffice for those venturing out, allowing for ease of movement in the light breeze and temperature changes. With such lovely weather, consider a leisurely stroll through one of the vibrant neighborhoods\u2014perhaps a quiet caf\u00e9 in the Mission for a calming morning brew, or a walk along the Embarcadero, taking in the delicate interplay of light on the water. The day promises equal parts comfort and inspiration, inviting simple excursions into the heart of this dynamic city.",
