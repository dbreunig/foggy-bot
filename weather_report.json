    "weather_report": "As twilight descends on Downtown San Francisco, a serene calm envelops the streets, punctuated only by the soft rustle of leaves in the mild breeze. The evening is predominantly clear, ideal for contemplating the world from a cozy corner caf\u00e9 or meandering through the quiet city streets. The temperature dips gently toward a cool 46 degrees, accompanied by a light Southwest wind, infusing the air with a refreshing crispness that beckons for a light jacket or a snug sweater to keep the chill at bay.\n\nTomorrow promises a bright sunlit day, as the warmth of the sun will embrace the city, rising toward a high near 60. The afternoon will soften slightly, settling around 58 degrees, inviting leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a leisurely visit to a weekend market. The elusive marine layer stays at bay for now, leaving the iconic sightlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and urban landscapes clearly defined against the cerulean sky, making it a perfect day for outdoor exploration or enjoying the vibrant local art scene. Whether an afternoon in a sun-drenched park or a tranquil walk with the coastline in view, the day ahead offers a delightful canvas for simple pleasures.",
