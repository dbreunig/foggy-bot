    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle interplay of light and cloud greets the day, offering a distinct calmness that lingers in the air. A veil of light drizzle may have passed earlier, marking its presence with a touch of moisture, but now the sun breaks through, scattering golden rays against golden gates. The city lies beneath a canopy of slowly shifting clouds, with hints of fog still dancing along the edges, particularly towards the bridge. This marine layer appears more lingering than overwhelming, framing the skyline in a soft embrace that enlivens the senses.\n\nWith temperatures nudging near 65 degrees, there's a pleasantness to the atmosphere that beckons one to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a cardigan paired with breathable fabrics, perfect for the mild breeze coursing through the neighborhoods. As the afternoon approaches, the warmth of the sun is predicted to taper back to a comfortable 63. This tranquil midday scene invites you to explore local caf\u00e9s or to enjoy a leisurely stroll through the parks, where the combination of fresh air and delicate sunlight creates a sanctuary for the soul. In these moments, it\u2019s not just the weather that captivates; it\u2019s the very essence of a day in San Francisco, leaving a promise for what lies ahead as the evening draws near.",
