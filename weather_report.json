    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a soft layer of clouds wraps the city in a gentle embrace, with a cool breeze whispering down the streets. The air hovers at a mild 50 degrees, setting a tranquil yet slightly crisp tone for the day unfolding. The sun, eager to make its presence felt, will break through the cloud cover later, transitioning to a partly sunny afternoon where the temperature pauses at a comfortable 58 before settling back to 56. A friendly west wind dances through the city, stirring the leaves and adding just enough briskness to remind us of spring's playful nature.\n\nThe marine layer, while not weighing heavily on visibility, brings a hint of fog that shrouds the bridge and softens the outlines of the skyline. One might find pleasure in donning a light jacket over a cozy sweater, perfect for the morning's chill, while preparing for the warmth of the sun expected to seep in as the day matures. It\u2019s a day that calls for contemplative walks along the Embarcadero, a visit to a tucked-away caf\u00e9, or simply finding a sunny spot in one of the city's charming parks to watch life unfold around you. Immerse yourself in the city's gentle rhythm; let the cool air invigorate your senses as you wander through this iconic landscape.",
