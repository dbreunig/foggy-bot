    "weather_report": "As twilight settles gently over Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp and carries the subtle fragrance of the bay, couched beneath a wide, clear sky. The shoreline reveals no trace of the notorious fog that often cloaks the Golden Gate; instead, the city basks in the soft embrace of serenity, with the temperature slipping to around 50 degrees as night unfolds. There's a gentle whisper of wind, barely rustling the leaves, as if nature itself is settling down for the evening.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, expect the sun to rise in full splendor, casting a warm glow over the city, with temperatures climbing to a pleasant high near 70. By afternoon, a light breeze will sweep through the streets, making it an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to one of the city's many vibrant parks. Dress in layers, as the mornings may still carry a hint of chill, but as day progresses, a light shirt or dress will embrace the warmth, inviting you to indulge in all the outdoor pleasures this beautiful city has to offer. The clear skies present a perfect backdrop for exploring local cafes or galleries, inviting both quiet reflection and the buzz of conversation as people savor a rare, cloudless spring day.",
