    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a radiant clarity, the city basking under a golden sun that has banished the veil of fog typical of this time of year. The air carries a crispness, a reminder that winter\u2019s chill lingers in the shadows, yet the warmth of the sunlight offers a gentle embrace. As the temperature rises to a pleasant height, the slight northwest breeze whispers secrets of Spring, rustling through the leaves of the ancient streets.\n\nThroughout the day, this clear weather will persist, with radiant blues painting the sky and the sight of iconic landmarks standing tall against the backdrop of an evolving canvas. While the fog lies reserved in the distance, a distant marine layer hovers over the horizon, marking the rugged beauty of the coastline. This delightful weather invites you to venture outdoors, perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero or an afternoon exploring the galleries of SoMa. Dress comfortably \u2014 a light jacket may be wise for when the sun dips low and the evening chill sets in. Revel in the warmth of the day and the promise of a picturesque sunset painting the bay, creating fleeting moments of beauty that linger in memory long after the light has faded.",
