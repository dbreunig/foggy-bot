Tonight, the temperature will nestle comfortably around 52 degrees, and a soft wind from the west southwest, whispering at about 12 miles per hour, encourages a sense of tranquility. The absence of fog paints a nearly unobstructed tapestry that gives promise to the day ahead.\n\nThursday dawns with a bright disposition, bathing the city in cheerful sunlight as a high near 64 degrees pulls at the curtain of the morning. While the mercury may dip to about 62 by afternoon, expect a refreshing breeze swaying at 10 to 20 miles per hour, with gusts flirting with 25. This delightful bout of weather invites one to dress in light layers\u2014perhaps a breathable sweater or a light jacket to embrace the coolness of the wind. Seize the opportunity to stroll through Golden Gate Park or sip coffee at a street-side caf\u00e9, basking in the vibrant energy of the city while the fog remains at bay, allowing the landmarks of San Francisco to shine in all their glory.",
