    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day dawns with a gentle embrace of sunlight, the kind that filters through the city\u2019s iconic architecture, casting playful shadows on the bustling streets below. The air is fresh, though a subtle coolness lingers as temperatures inch toward a comfortable average of 66 degrees. A light wind stirs, whispering through the avenues, bringing with it a hint of the bay's salty spray. Tonight, the sky will draw its curtain of clouds lower, settling at around 56 degrees, making for a cozy evening.\n\nAs you step outside, you may notice areas where the marine layer clings stubbornly to the city\u2019s edges\u2014particularly around the Golden Gate, a reminder of nature's gentle persistence. However, in the heart of downtown, visibility is ample, allowing the details of the cityscape to emerge clearly against the azure. This combination of sun and cloud creates an inviting atmosphere, perfect for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s quaint caf\u00e9s with a warm drink in hand. Dress in layers to adapt to the ebb and flow of temperatures throughout the day, and consider a light jacket for the evening as the coolness wraps around the city like a soft shawl.",
