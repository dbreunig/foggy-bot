    "weather_report": "As dawn softly breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp and invigorating, carrying a whisper of drizzle that quickly dissipates into clarity. The skies are mostly clear, revealing glimpses of blue, though a light marine layer hovers in the distance, a delicate veil obscuring some of the notable landmarks. The westward breeze, gentle yet persistent, rustles through the trees, hinting at the warmth that awaits when the sun fully emerges. \n\nFor your Sunday ahead, prepare for a day painted in vibrant sunshine tempered by cool afternoon breezes. The temperature will gracefully rise to about the low 70s, though that balmy warmth may gradually retreat as the day unfolds. With a touch of lightness in the air, it's wise to dress in layers \u2014 a light sweater over your shirt should suffice for the morning chill, easily shedding it as the sun ascends. This is a perfect opportunity to enjoy a leisurely stroll through one of the city's peaceful parks or perhaps settle down at an outdoor caf\u00e9 with a good book, soaking in the gentle energy of a city that awakens with you.",
