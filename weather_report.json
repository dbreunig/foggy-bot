    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the city's charm remains cloaked in a delicate mixture of sunlight and lingering clouds. The forecast hints at a modest chance of rain before 4 p.m., though the atmosphere feels mostly dry at the moment and is adorned with fleeting glimpses of sunlight. The mercury hovers around a cool 58 degrees, but a subtle drop to 56 is expected as the hours pass. A gentle westward breeze creates a serene soundscape, rustling the leaves and stirring the spirits of pedestrians.\n\nTonight, the skies will clear, inviting a deeper chill that will settle around 46 degrees, edging slightly higher to wrap you in a cozy embrace as the night matures. The northwestern wind will whisper softly as you stroll through quiet streets, making a light jacket an ideal companion. Perhaps the city\u2019s charms beckon you to a mellow evening\u2014an exploratory walk along the Embarcadero, savoring the lower lights of incoming vessels, or a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, absorbing the city's rhythm while sipping something warm. The faint marine layer, a subtle reminder of the bay\u2019s presence, softly embraces the horizon, hinting at a coastal mystery that lingers just out of sight.",
