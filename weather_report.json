    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, the evening air carries a gentle chill that whispers of nearby fog, settling softly like a silken shawl upon the city. The forecast hints at patchy fog rolling in after midnight, painting the skyline in muted hues, while the night holds steadfast at a cool 53 degrees. A light breeze stirs, barely perceptible, yet the tranquility of the moment promises a reprieve from the day's mundane bustle.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the day will greet you with a damp embrace, the fog lingering before the sun struggles against the clouds, a last breath of winter. As temperatures hover around a modest 61 degrees, falling gently to 58 by afternoon, it offers the perfect backdrop for a contemplative walk along the waterfront or a leisurely brunch at a cozy cafe, warmed by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Adorning yourself in layers will serve you well; a light jacket, perhaps even a scarf, will guard you against the coolness of the marine layer, enabling you to savor the day without distraction. Embrace the mystique of San Francisco as it gently reveals its charm, inviting you to explore its quiet streets or lose yourself in a book at a hidden park bench, all while the city dances gracefully between fog and fleeting glimpses of sunshine.",
