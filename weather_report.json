    "weather_report": "The sun casts a golden hue over Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, bathing the city in warmth as temperatures flirt with the pleasant mid-70s. Fluffy white clouds dot the azure sky, but it remains predominantly clear, allowing the iconic skyline to sparkle against the backdrop of the bay's deep blue waters. A gentle westward breeze carries the crisp scent of the Pacific, teasing leaves and offering a refreshing contrast to the day's warmth. There is no fog to obscure the view; if anything, the clarity of the air enhances the beauty of landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge, standing tall and inviting against the horizon.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect the skies to maintain their clear disposition while temperatures slide toward the comfortable embrace of the upper 50s. A light layer will be prudent for those venturing out after dark, perhaps a light jacket to shield against the cool breeze that will accompany the night. Such enchanting weather invites a leisurely stroll along Embarcadero or a tranquil moment at one of the city\u2019s cozy cafes, where one might savor a warm drink while relishing the comforting expanse of evening views. This gentle transition from day to night, framed by the shimmering lights of the city, promises a truly delightful San Francisco experience.",
