    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a tapestry of gray clouds, holding an uncertain promise of rain. The atmosphere is mostly cloudy, with a chill that whispers through the streets, urging you to layer comfortably. As temperatures gently decline from a mild beginning, the peak of warmth rests around 57 degrees, easing toward 55 as the afternoon wears on. A light wind drifts quietly, carrying the scent of salty ocean air mixed with the hint of impending showers.\n\nAs the evening beckons, the chance of rain begins to rise, with drops expected to serenade the city after 10 PM. The clouds deepen, enveloping the skyline, while the cool, nipping breeze from the north gives reason to retreat indoors with a warm beverage and a good book. For a day like this, dressing in a soft, thick cardigan and sturdy shoes will keep one both comfortable and prepared for the damp, fleeting moments of rain. This is not a day for bustling outdoor activities; rather, consider a leisurely stroll through a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring the warmth of a freshly brewed cup. The city, although veiled, hums with life, waiting to reveal its charm behind the clouds.",
