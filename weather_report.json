    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Downtown San Francisco, a gentle blanket of clouds hangs low, casting soft shadows over the iconic skyline. The evening is cool, with temperatures dipping to a comfortable 52 degrees, inviting the kind of reflective solitude one often finds in the city\u2019s hidden corners. The west-southwest wind, a light caress at 6 to 9 mph, rustles through the trees, whispering secrets of the bay and the golden hues of the day transitioning into night. Although the lower visibility hints at the potential presence of fog, it is not yet a decisive figure, merely adding a mystique to the horizon.\n\nLooking ahead, Wednesday promises a shift from the cloud-draped evening to a partially sunny disposition that will warm up to near 60 degrees. With a boost of southwest winds kicking up to 13 mph, one can expect a fresher, more lively atmosphere. As the day unfolds, that gentle hint of the marine layer may linger along the golden gate, blending with the vibrancy of city life. Dressing in layers will be prudent; a light jacket or sweater will suffice to navigate the day's cool edges, while comfortable footwear beckons for a leisurely stroll\u2014perhaps through a local park or along the waterfront, where the last whispers of evening fade into the lull of the night.",
