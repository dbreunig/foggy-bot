    "weather_report": "The night hangs heavy over Downtown San Francisco, cloaked in a gentle veil of clouds that whisper tales of impending rain. A soft swathe of fog mingles with the cool air, hinting at the marine layer just beyond, perhaps retreating into the depths of the Bay. As the dawn approaches, the temperature settles around a balmy 62 degrees, inviting one to embrace warmth yet clutch a light jacket for that lingering chill. \n\nCome Tuesday, the clouds may part just slightly, revealing gleams of sunshine against a backdrop of unsettled skies. A chance of rain shows its face early but gives way in the afternoon to a more spirited vibe, with a pleasant high near 68 degrees. While the winds shift from the southwest, carrying a hint of sea spray, they promise only gentle companionship. This is not the day for grand outdoor escapades, but rather one for tranquil meanderings\u2014perhaps a stroll along the waterfront, where the breeze dances through the palm fronds, or a quiet morning spent in a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring freshly brewed coffee while watching the city wake. Layered attire would serve well, a light sweater draped easily over a tee, setting the stage for an evolving day that dances between cool and comfortable.",
