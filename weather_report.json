    "weather_report": "The air around Downtown San Francisco tonight is surprisingly clear, a tranquil eye before the sun rises again. A gentle calm has settled, the temperature dipping to a cool embrace, inviting those who cherish the crispness of spring evenings to stroll along quiet streets. A faint breeze whispers through, its soft touch urging a light jacket or sweater, perfect for the vibrant afterglow of city lights mingling with the darkening sky. \n\nAs dawn approaches tomorrow, the forecast promises a sun-soaked day, where warmth paints the city with colors that shimmer and brighten. With highs around 65, the sun will warm the chill of morning, although the afternoon may see temperatures retreat slightly, reminding us of the city\u2019s whimsical climate. The air is expected to remain relatively clear, with no veil of fog obstructing views of the Golden Gate or the chestnut hills. A stroll through the park or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 would be a delightful way to savor the day, as the gentle breeze continues to weave through the streets, making any outing both refreshing and invigorating.",
