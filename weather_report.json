    "weather_report": "As dawn paints the early sky over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle whisper of drizzle lingers, a minor prelude to the day ahead, lifting just before the sun rises. The air is cool, settling into the low 56 degrees as a southwest breeze nudges through the neighborhoods, adding a subtle chill to the morning. By midday, the clouds will recede, yielding to a sunny disposition that promises warmth, reaching up to 65 degrees before taking a slight dip in the afternoon. The winds will pick up a bit, dancing joyfully in gusts, as if inviting you outside to savor the unfolding beauty of the city.\n\nYet, as the city stirs awake, the presence of fog, that familiar San Francisco companion, may still cling to the edges of the Golden Gate, offering a picturesque view of the bridges shrouded in mystery. Today's clarity beckons one to lace up comfortable shoes and stroll along the waterfront or meander through the tree-lined streets, seeking out tucked-away caf\u00e9s or lively markets. Dress in layers, as this urban landscape often oscillates between crisp liners of chill and the soft touch of afternoon sunshine. A lightweight sweater or a casual jacket would be your best companions, allowing you the freedom to bask comfortably in the warmth as the fog's allure lingers along the coast. Amidst this delightful shift in weather, consider capturing the day by exploring the local art scene or enjoying a leisurely lunch at an inviting outdoor eatery, where the atmosphere is just as refreshing as the day itself.",
