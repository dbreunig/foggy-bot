The cool air, resting just above the mild temperatures, holds a whisper of the ocean, hinting at the marine layer's presence\u2014most distinctly lingering around the Golden Gate, veiling it in its characteristic mystery. While the skies appear weary, with an expectant grayness, small pockets of brightness promise a gentler unfolding as the day progresses.\n\nBy lunchtime, the dripping crescendos of early drizzle will retreat, making way for flares of sunlight that will dance across the city\u2019s rooftops, although temperatures are unlikely to stir up much warmth. A light breeze will tug at your sleeves, encouraging layered outfits\u2014perhaps a light jacket paired with a cozy shirt underneath, perfect for meandering through local shops or indulging in the pleasure of a caf\u00e9 terrace. Whether you navigate the streets or catch a bridge view, the day's simplicity suggests a leisurely pace, inviting quiet reflections and satisfying conversations amidst the serene backdrop of the ever-enigmatic fog.",
