    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun casts a gentle warmth over Downtown San Francisco, with the crisp breeze whispering through the streets. While temperatures hover around a comfortable mid-60s, the allure of a sunny day may begin to fade as the afternoon ebbs, giving way to a slight chill. As daylight wanes, a hint of drizzled fog may blanket the horizon after two in the morning, yet with only a 20% chance, one might still revel in the clarity of a day that veers towards the serene.\n\nIn this delightful mix of sunshine and anticipation, dressing in layers seems wise\u2014considering a light sweater for when the sun dips low, perhaps complemented by light pants to navigate the breezy avenues. The ambiance invites casual strolls through Golden Gate Park, or perhaps a leisurely coffee at a downtown caf\u00e9, watching the world pass by while the city slowly transforms into an evening of twinkling lights. It\u2019s a perfect day to appreciate the quiet moments before dusk envelops the Bay in its gentle embrace.",
