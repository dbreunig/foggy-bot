    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the sun is making a determined appearance this afternoon, casting a warm glow over the city with temperatures hovering around a pleasant 60 degrees. As the day wears on, those temperatures will gently dip to a cozy 57, inviting urban explorers to take advantage of the daylight. The crisp air carries a hint of tranquility, with a light west wind fluttering at around six miles per hour, making it easy to breathe in the fresh energies of the season.\n\nAs twilight approaches and the city transitions into evening, a veil of mostly clear skies will cradle San Francisco, with the mercury settling into a cool 46. The gentle southwest winds will accompany the night, whispering promises of a peaceful rest. Given such delightful weather, a stroll through the vibrant streets might beckon. Perhaps a stop at a local caf\u00e9, where one can relish a warm drink while watching the world pass by, might be in order. A light jacket would suffice against the evening chill, allowing you to embrace the unfolding night comfortably.",
