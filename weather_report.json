    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, a veil of clouds drapes the skyline, giving the day a subdued yet serene quality. As the sun's rays struggle to break through the overcast, the temperature hovers around a comfortable 62 degrees, but it will gently retreat to around 60 as the evening creeps in. Expect a persistent south-southwest wind, carrying a hint of the sea, with gusts that might remind you of the gentle whispers of an old friend\u2014refreshing yet brisk. There's an impending dance with rain, a 40% chance teasing those seeking a dry escape.\n\nAs daylight wanes, the atmosphere may become a tad more somber, with continued chances of rain and a low settling around 54. Perhaps the marine layer, unseen yet felt, cloaks the horizon, leading to that distinctive San Francisco mystique\u2014the invisible boundary where land meets sea. For those brave souls wishing to embrace the city, a light jacket or sweater draped over a comfortable outfit will serve well against the cool breeze. A stroll along the Embarcadero or a casual visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 could be the perfect antidote to this cloudy interlude, offering warmth, comfort, and perhaps a fleeting glimpse of the iconic bridge peeking through the mist.",
