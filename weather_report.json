    "weather_report": "The day in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a delicate sky, where the sun spreads a golden warmth across the city while gentle breezes carry whispers of the sea. Temperatures hover pleasantly in the low sixties, dipping slightly as the afternoon approaches. As the day wears on, the clarity of the atmosphere remains inviting, with only the slightest hint of a marine layer lingering at the edges. The typical San Francisco fog has kept its distance, allowing unobstructed views of the iconic skyline and the majestic Golden Gate, splendidly poised for all who might venture outside.\n\nAs evening descends, a remaining lightness will mingle with a blanket of partly cloudy hues, suggesting a cozy, serene atmosphere. Those making plans for the night might find comfort in light layers\u2014perhaps a sweater or jacket to stave off the cooler air while they stroll through the neighborhoods or enjoy a quiet dinner on a patio, keeping the spirit of the day alive. With winds brisk but refreshing, an evening walk alongside the waterfront promises both calm and a touch of adventure, as the city lights begin to flicker to life, crafting their own magic against the deepening twilight.",
