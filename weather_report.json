The air is gently stirred by a southwestern breeze, whispering of warmer hours to come. For those venturing out, the day begins cool, with temperatures hovering near 55 degrees, a prelude to a morning wrapped in a muted light\u2014the city\u2019s iconic structures almost ghostlike against the gauzy backdrop. This is not the fog of summer\u2019s dreams, but rather a soft cover, hinting that the marine layer remains a close companion along the coast.\n\nBy midday, however, the sun shall reclaim its territory, gradually banishing the clouds as the temperatures climb toward a mild 64 degrees. The afternoon will see a playful dance of winds, with southwest gusts encouraging soft laughter, the swaying trees providing a rhythm to the day. Dress thoughtfully\u2014layering is essential as the warmth emerges, and a light jacket will guard against the chill and create a sense of comfort amid the shifting weather.\n\nAs the city awakens to this blend of cloud and sun, it offers a perfect backdrop for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 with the inviting aroma of freshly brewed coffee. The clamoring waves and distant hum of activity provide a soundtrack as one might sit and observe, unhurried, allowing the pulse of the city to wash over them. Today is not just a day to be weathered through, but an invitation to savor every moment, to take joy in the dance between fog and sun that is uniquely San Francisco.",
