    "weather_report": "Awakening to a serene morning in Downtown San Francisco, the skies stretch out mostly clear, with a gentle warmth beginning to encroach the chill of night. As dawn unfurls, the city lay beneath a soft embrace of light, a promise of pleasant hours ahead. Expect the sun to dominate this Friday, peeking through blue stretches, with temperatures inching closer to a comfortable warmth around 71 degrees before easing into the late afternoon. The breeze arrives, too, a casual nod from the southwest, stirring a playful dance among the leaves and bringing with it whispers of the bay.\n\nThe weather looks inviting, mercifully free of the usual fog blankets that might drape themselves over the iconic landmarks. Instead, the horizon offers clarity, beckoning one to explore the vibrant streets. As the day unfolds, a light jacket or a cozy sweater will serve as a faithful companion, especially as the evening descends and the temperatures dip once more. Take this splendid opportunity to stroll through the lush nooks of Golden Gate Park or perhaps indulge in a leisurely coffee al fresco, watching the world conquer the day. For art lovers, an afternoon visit to the SF Museum of Modern Art could provide a delightful respite from the sun, while the evening sun might just inspire a gentle walk across the bridge, a salute to the skyline that glows gracefully as day transitions into night.",
