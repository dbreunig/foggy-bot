    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco opens with a soft, muted light, the remnants of gentle drizzle pricking at the air before it dissipates, leaving the city beneath a curtain of partially sunny skies. While the temperature lingers comfortably close to 63 degrees, there's a distinct bite in the breeze, the west-southwest wind stirring at 7 to 15 mph with occasional gusts reminding one of the bay's temperamental nature. The horizon may appear slightly blurred, likely owing to a fine, silvery marine layer hanging low, hinting at fog's persistent touch, particularly near the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the clouds to roll in again, nudging the temperature down slightly to around 61 degrees by afternoon. This mild climate invites layered dressing; a light jacket or sweater would balance well against the cool wind and surprising chill of the evening. Given the forecast's inclination towards patches of drizzle after midnight, a walk through the neighborhoods or perhaps a quiet afternoon in the caf\u00e9 with a warm drink\u2014while leafing through a book or sharing conversations with friends\u2014would be perfectly delightful pursuits for the day. The city remains a tapestry of soft colors, the gentle weather demanding a pause, a moment to inhale the essence of San Francisco\u2019s charm even as it hints at nature's larger narrative.",
