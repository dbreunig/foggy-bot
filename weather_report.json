    "weather_report": "As twilight nudges its way into Downtown San Francisco, the horizon succumbs to a heavy cloud cover that drapes the city in a muted, worn gray. The winds whisper gently from the south, tending to rustle the leaves ever so slightly while a subtle salty scent hints at the proximity of the bay. The atmosphere is thick with anticipation, the kind that swells before a downpour\u2014tonight, rain is not merely likely; it's imminent, a curtain of droplets that will draw down from the sky after 11 PM. The chill in the air, with temperatures flirting around 49 degrees, suggests warm layers are a sensible choice for an evening venture. Those braving the night should reach for a comfortable jacket and perhaps a light scarf, while sturdy shoes might be prudent for navigating through potential puddles.\n\nTomorrow, the city will wake beneath a somber blanket of clouds, with the promise of persistent rain throughout the day. With high temperatures reaching a modest 60 degrees, it feels like a day best suited for quiet introspection. The downpour could become a soundtrack for those cozying up indoors with a good book or a classic film, while the brave-hearted may find solace in the understated beauty of the wet streets, glistening under the sparse light. A stop at a local caf\u00e9 may offer the perfect blend of warmth and comfort as the world outside transforms, softened and blurred by the rain. As the evening and the rain intertwine, San Francisco invites you to find solace amidst the impending storm.",
