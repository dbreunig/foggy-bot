    "weather_report": "As dawn gently breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the air retains a cool embrace, circled by a stillness that hints at the day\u2019s unfolding charm. With temperatures hovering in the low fifties, the city greets the morning with partly cloudy skies, where fleeting moments of light catch the contours of buildings, creating a silhouette that speaks to the resilience of this urban landscape. The southwest winds stir softly, ushering in the promise of a vibrant day.\n\nCome Sunday, expect the sun to step confidently onto the stage of this storied city. The forecast claims a mostly sunny disposition with highs peaking near sixty-two, allowing time for the clouds to retreat and reveal shades of blue that might coax locals outdoors. However, as the afternoon settles in, those temperatures will wane slightly, a gentle reminder to layer up as the breeze, subtle yet persistent at times, turns sharper with gusts that could playfully dance through your hair. Anyone watching for the familiar glimpse of the marine layer may notice it stretching languidly, melding with the familiar San Francisco mist that creeps along the coastline\u2014an ever-present pulse of nature\u2019s artistry.\n\nToday, dressing in layers will be your best ally. A light jacket will provide a defense against the morning chill, while a comfortable shirt or blouse can carry you into the warmth of midday. As the city awakens, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to one of the local cafes nestled within the bustling streets, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee beckons. The spirits of the locals and the pulse of the day form an invitation to enjoy the simple pleasure of being outside, absorbing the charm of a city that knows how to balance energy and tranquility.",
