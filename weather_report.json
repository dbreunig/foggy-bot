    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the skies unveil a scene painted in soft shades of blue and gold, though whispers of fog still linger in the air. The forecast promises a mostly sunny day, with temperatures nudging up to a comfortable 65 degrees before gradually dipping to a mild 62 in the afternoon. A gentle southwest breeze dances around the city, urging the morning\u2019s lingering chill to retreat and adding a refreshing edge to the ambiance. \n\nThis transitional light hints at both clarity and mystery, as the fog still drapes itself over the hills and just beneath the Golden Gate Bridge. It is a day where adventure beckons; perhaps a leisurely stroll through the Presidio would be refreshing, or a visit to one of the local cafes tucked away in the charming streets of the Mission. Dress in layers\u2014a light jacket will serve well against the brisk winds, particularly as twilight descends and the clouds gather. As the sun sets, the evening will envelop the city in a gentle embrace, with the cool air inviting you to gather outdoors before nightfall.",
