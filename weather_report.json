    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, the morning air carries a gentle chill, marking the transition from night to day. The sky above is mostly cloudy, with shades of gray lingering like a soft blanket over the city. These clouds, gentle yet pervasive, are a reminder of the marine layer that hugs the coastline, threading through the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the skyline. The high for today hovers near 60 degrees, which may feel like a reprieve for some after recent unfiltered sun; however, temperatures will fall back to a cooler 58 in the afternoon, caressed by a light southwest breeze that whispers through the streets.\n\nAs the day progresses, this partly sunny disposition invites an array of simple pleasures. Imagine strolling through one of the city's quieter parks, the crisp air invigorating as you breathe in the scent of damp earth and budding flowers. A light jacket or cardigan is your best companion, perfect for layering as you enjoy a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9, watching the world awaken. Ultimately, it\u2019s a day that holds the promise of understated beauty, where vibrant colors may emerge in fleeting glimpses as the fog dances with the sun.",
