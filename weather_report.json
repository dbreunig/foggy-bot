    "weather_report": "As dawn settles over Downtown San Francisco, the city greets the day with clear skies stretching expansively, inviting warmth and light to seep into every corner. With temperatures expected to hover around the low seventies, a gentle southwest breeze tickles the air, carrying the promise of a delightful summer day. While the peaks of the city are warm, a wisp of marine layer clings to the outer edges, hinting at the playful interplay between sunshine and the cool embrace of the Pacific. \n\nAs the golden orb continues its ascent, it casts a warm glow that dances on the rooftops and pavements, transforming the cool morning into an inviting afternoon. An outing beckons\u2014perhaps a stroll along the waterfront, where each step along the promenade breathes in the salty tang of the bay. Layering lightly with a comfortable jacket or sweater is wise, particularly as the evening will usher in a refreshingly cool breeze. This unassuming yet pleasant day calls for simple joys: find a quiet caf\u00e9, sample a warm pastry, or simply relish the spectacle of a city alive with summer's charm.",
