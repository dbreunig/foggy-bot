    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm blankets the city, the low overnight temperature kissing the air with a coolness that hints at approaching spring yet retains that peculiarity of coastal chill. The sky is partially obscured, casting a soft veil of clouds, but the promise of a mostly sunny Friday shines brightly ahead. The winds, teasingly mild from the west, carry the distant scent of the ocean\u2014anticipation stirs for a day of glory, with temperatures expected to reach a high near 60, then gently waning as the afternoon unfolds.\n\nThe vista this morning is relatively clear, though a slight haze lingers at the edges, suggesting the remnants of a marine layer ready to retreat as the sun climbs higher. Fog tends to linger in the shadows along the bay and Golden Gate, but those familiar with the rhythm of the city know this is merely a passing dance with nature before the full brightness sets in. The day beckons for simple pleasures: a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, a moment sipped from a coffee while sitting in the warmth of a sunbeam, or a quiet read in a favorite park nook, where the chatter of the city blends with the rustling leaves. With layers a must\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a light shirt\u2014the charm of San Francisco in early spring presents endless opportunities for those keen to embrace its tempered beauty.",
