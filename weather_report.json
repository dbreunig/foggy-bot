    "weather_report": "As the gentle embrace of drizzle blankets the evening in Downtown San Francisco, the sky hangs heavy with a shroud of clouds, heralding a night wrapped in gray cotton. The world below remains in relative calm, punctuated by a soft wind whispering through the streets, hinting at the chill of the sea. Despite the coolness, the amber lights of the city create a warm glow against the muted backdrop, casting a cozy invitation to explore the urban tapestry.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Friday, the promise of a partly sunny day begins to unfurl. Morning mists may linger with an air of mystery before yielding to brief glimpses of sunlight. Yet, the cool air remains, falling softly into the afternoon. Light layers paired with a light jacket will suit the weather beautifully, allowing for easy movement in the crisp breeze. Today is perfect for meandering through the artistic alleys of the Mission or sipping a warm cup at a local caf\u00e9, allowing the comforting embrace of good food and company to dispel any lingering chill. An art gallery visit or a leisurely walk along the waterfront would also reward any wanderer with fleeting views of a city both alive and momentarily at rest.",
