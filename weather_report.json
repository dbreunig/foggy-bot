    "weather_report": "In the still of the night, Downtown San Francisco rests beneath a modest blanket of clouds, with the temperature hovering around an inviting 50 degrees. This gentle warmth sets the stage for a day that promises a gradual transition from coolness to bright clarity. As the sun rises, it will rise above the city, ushering in a mostly sunny forecast. By midday, temperatures will find their rhythm, reaching towards a comfortable 68 degrees, before settling back to around 66 as the afternoon unfolds. Gentle southwestern winds whisper through the streets, maintaining a soft caress against the skin.\n\nAhead of the day, expect the fog to linger only as an afterthought, retreating to the peripheries by mid-morning. The clarity promises a pleasant ambience, ideal for a leisurely stroll along Fisherman\u2019s Wharf or a quiet read in one of the city\u2019s charming parks. Consider dressing in layers to embrace the morning chill and the midday warmth\u2014a light sweater or jacket paired with comfortable trousers will serve well. With the scene set, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm brew or a slow-paced walk through the Mission District\u2019s vibrant murals could make for a splendid way to appreciate a day that dances between sun and cloud.",
