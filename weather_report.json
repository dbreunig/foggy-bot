The gentle voices of the west-southwest winds whisper at 10 to 16 mph, their playful gusts heightening the rhythm of the day with a hint of summer's embrace. While the morning is bathed in sunlight, it hints at a familiar dance with the marine layer, never far from its coast. The atmosphere is mostly clear, with only the slightest wisps of fog lingering inland, reminding us of the city's unpredictable airways.\n\nAs the afternoon approaches, expect a subtle cooling as temperatures gracefully taper to 67\u2014a soft invitation to find refuge in a light jacket or a cozy shawl. The evening settles in, with a low around 56, making it perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero. Picture a scene of laughter and camaraderie at an outdoor caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the cool evening air. The day\u2019s brightness wanes to a vibrant twilight, a gentle reminder that in San Francisco, every moment offers its own unique charm.",
