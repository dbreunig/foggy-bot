    "weather_report": "As the night cloaks Downtown San Francisco, a gentle, cool ambiance whispers promises of change. The air carries a hint of moisture, suggesting the possibility of a light shower while the clouds drift lazily above, casting soft shadows across the gleaming city below. The wind, brisk from the west northwest, continues to swirl through the streets, embodying a refreshing energy amidst the stillness, with remnants of warmth retreating.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the clouds may yield to sunlit moments, revealing a sky that aims to be mostly clear, gradually breaking free from the gray embrace of night. Daytime brings a nuanced beauty, as the city prepares for a mild high around 56 degrees, tempered by a touch of sunlight. A light jacket would be wise, allowing for comfort against the cool breeze while venturing out. Perhaps a leisurely walk through the nearby parks could be in store, where the scent of damp earth mingles with the early blooms of spring, or maybe savoring a quiet cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9 while watching the city awaken to its rhythmic heartbeat. It promises to be a day reflective of the inviting charm of San Francisco, where the horizon can hint at warmth even on the cooler days.",
