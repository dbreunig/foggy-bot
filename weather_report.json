    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a pleasant touch, as the sun breaks through, casting a soft glow over the city. The high, expected to hover gently around 64 degrees, allows for a chill that dips toward 61 as the day progresses. A west wind whips through, offering whispers of coolness with gusts that dance lightly around 18 mph, reassuring you that the fog, a constant companion here, is retreating. Despite some clouds lingering above, they part just enough to reveal the city\u2019s charm, making it a fine time for a stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps indulging in some leisurely window shopping in the vibrant shops of Union Square.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the scenes will shift to a partly cloudy evening, with temperatures settling around 49 degrees. A light wrap or sweater would suffice against the cooling breeze. The allure of the twilight sky is undeniable; evenings in this city often beg for quiet contemplation. A cozy caf\u00e9 or a quiet bench in a park offers the perfect stage for unwinding, savoring a warm drink or a good book, surrounded by the city\u2019s intricate beauty as it enters the night.",
