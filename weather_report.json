As you gaze outwards, the sun casts its gentle warmth, though you may not quite feel it yet\u2014temperatures hover around a cool 58 degrees, and the day will soften to a brisk 56 as the afternoon unfolds. The west winds whisper lightly, a refreshing tune that beckons outdoor exploration. While the forecast promises mostly sunny skies, the morning reveals an overcast expanse and hints of the fog that often graces this coastal city, framing the Golden Gate Bridge in a misty allure.\n\nTonight, as twilight approaches, the atmosphere will shift, urging residents to wrap themselves in cozy layers against the cool embrace of a low dipping to around 49. A stroll through the nearby streets would prove inviting; perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink or a leisurely walk along the waterfront would allow one to bask in the joy of a city waking slowly to a sunlit promise. For those considering outings, this is a day to don a light jacket and welcome the fresh air, embracing the quiet charm that envelops San Francisco.",
