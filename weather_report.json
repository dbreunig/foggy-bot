    "weather_report": "In the early hours of the day, a subtle dampness fills the air over Downtown San Francisco. The horizon is cloaked in a veil of mist, softening the outlines of familiar landmarks. As the morning progresses, expect patchy drizzle to linger, but an invitation for the afternoon awaits with a promise of partially sunny skies. The low hanging clouds carry a whisper of the ocean, tucking in a gentle chill around 56 degrees, a typical embrace from the bay. By midday, the sun will expose more of its character\u2014settling into a mild high of about 64, tempered by a brisk west-southwest wind that dances playfully through the streets.\n\nAs this fog unfolds, the marine layer begins to lift, revealing glimpses of blue sky that may encourage passersby to cherish the outdoor offerings of the city. For those venturing outside, comfortable layers are the key; a light jacket will serve you well against the cool breeze while navigating the urban landscape. Consider a leisurely stroll through the Mission District, where the vibrant murals and aroma of fresh coffee create a delightful harmony. A visit to the Ferry Building might also be in order, coffee in hand, as you relish in the gentle hum of the city awakening. As this day unfolds, let the unusual blend of fog and emerging sunlight wrap you in the uniquely charming embrace of San Francisco.",
