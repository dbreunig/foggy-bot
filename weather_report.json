    "weather_report": "As the sun sets over Downtown San Francisco tonight, a gentle blanket of clouds drifts across the sky, cloaking the city in a soft shadow. The temperature dips to a comfortable 52 degrees, inviting those out and about to bundle themselves lightly against the whispering southwest wind that weaves through the streets. The ever-present marine layer often dances near the coastline, seemingly just beyond the reach of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, leaving the heart of the city with a calm, muted radiance.\n\nTomorrow dawns with a promise of partly sunny skies, where the city might awaken to patches of brilliance amid the lingering clouds. With a high near 61 degrees, it would be wise to embrace light layers\u2014a cozy sweater or light jacket should do just fine for the day ahead, allowing you to breathe in the fresh air while any lingering chill of the morning recedes. This quieter Tuesday invites exploration; perhaps a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero could yield peaceful moments at the waterfront. Alternatively, one might indulge in a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the warmth of coffee harmonizes with the soothing hum of conversation\u2014the perfect refuge as the city breathes in slow rhythm through the day.",
