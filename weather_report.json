    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the air whispers with a faint chill as clouds drift lazily across the sky, creating a soothing backdrop to the streetlights casting their warm glow. With the temperature settling around 47 degrees, the gentle breeze from the west northwest, at about 8 mph, invites a light jacket or perhaps a cozy sweater for evening strolls along the waterfront. \n\nAs dawn breaks on Friday, a promise of sunshine emerges, painting the city in soft, golden hues. Anticipate highs near 60, with a gradual cooling that\u2019s typical of this maritime locale, as the west wind continues to play its role, softly stirring the leaves. While the horizon may spark with clarity, hints of fog may linger in spots, potentially veiling the grand Golden Gate. This perfect balance of sun and sea will beckon you to venture outdoors\u2014perhaps to wander through the Mission District\u2019s vibrant murals or indulge in a leisurely coffee at a quaint caf\u00e9. Opt for layers, embracing the morning sunlight with a light scarf, knowing a soft layer will serve you well as the day unfolds into a fresh afternoon.",
