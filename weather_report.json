The night may have brought with it a whisper of drizzle, which now dissipates into the backdrop of a sky that is only beginning to clear. Today promises glimpses of that famed sun which has eluded the city for much of the early morning. Highs will hover around the mid-60s\u2014a comfortable warmth offered by the sun, though clouds will still linger in playful opposition.\n\nThe breeze from the west southwest carries with it a freshness, dancing through the streets with gusts that could lift spirits and skirts alike. Yet, it\u2019s wise to layer up in anticipation of the fluctuating temperatures; a light jacket will serve perfectly as the warmth of midday beckons. As the city stirs to life, the opportunity arises for leisurely strolls along the waterfront, perhaps a quiet moment in the shade of a tree in one of the parks, or indulging in the rich flavors at a local caf\u00e9 where the atmosphere is as inviting as the coffee itself. The day lays before you, filled with the promise of exploration and the simple pleasure of being amidst the city\u2019s enduring charm.",
