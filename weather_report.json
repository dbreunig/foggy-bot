    "weather_report": "Night blankets Downtown San Francisco in an embrace of clarity, where the low temperatures around 49 degrees speak of a breezy evening. The west-northwest winds, gentle yet spirited, dance through the city streets, whispering tales of the cool Pacific air. The sky stretches above, inky and serene, offering a promise of pleasantness for the coming day, with Sunday poised to unveil warm sunlight that will warm up the urban fabric underfoot. A high near 65 beckons with the allure of lazy, sun-soaked afternoons, while the background symphony of mild winds invites both wanderers and dreamers alike.\n\nAs dawn approaches, one might find that the fog has retreated, leaving room for the sun to spill over the horizon and illuminate the iconic streets. Dressing in layers will be the wise choice, as the day begins with the soft chill of twilight but soon blossoms into mild warmth. A light jacket and comfortable attire will serve one well, perfect for a stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many parks. The world awaits with simple pleasures \u2014 a leisurely coffee in a sunlit caf\u00e9, or perhaps the exploration of an art gallery, where inspiration can be as abundant as the brightening sky.",
