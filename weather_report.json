    "weather_report": "As the night drapes a velvet cloak over Downtown San Francisco, the city breathes in a refreshing clarity, the air cool and crisp, with a hint of coastal tranquility settling in. The forecast whispers of a serene Wednesday ahead, where the sun\u2019s warm embrace will elevate the day toward a gentle high of 68, though it will gradually give way to a comforting 65 in the afternoon. Currently, the skies unfurl mostly clear, each star flickering like a distant promise, accompanied only by a whispering breeze from the east-southeast.\n\nAs the dawn unfurls, expect a wave of sunshine to wash over the neighborhoods, brightening streets where the morning dew still lingers, glistening like pearls set against the pavements. While fog is a cherished companion of this coastal city, today it seems to hover further afield, leaving the iconic Golden Gate Bridge unveiled in all its splendor. This pleasant weather invites one to wear light layers\u2014a cozy sweater over a long-sleeve shirt should suffice, allowing for easy adjustments as the sun climbs higher. A leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9 would suit the day beautifully, with cups of warm coffee and contemplative reads providing perfect company as the city awakens.",
