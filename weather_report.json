    "weather_report": "In the early hours of Monday, Downtown San Francisco greets the day with a crisp clarity, as the night vacates and the sun prepares its ascent. A gentle northwest breeze whispers through the streets, nudging the chill from the air, while the starting temperatures linger in the mid-forties. Though remnants of the night still hang about, the promise of a sunlit morning beckons. The city seems poised, embracing the warmth that looms on the horizon, yet one can still find the cool embrace of the early hours nipping at the edges.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect a gentle shift towards warmth, where temperatures will rise to just around fifty-six, eventually settling down to a cooler afternoon in the mid-fifties. The atmosphere remains remarkably clear, with a notable absence of the usual fog that blankets the hills and valleys. As the sunlight pours over landmarks, the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate and the shimmering Bay come into focus, inviting residents and visitors alike to explore the outdoors. It\u2019s an ideal moment for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet stop at a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink while watching the world awaken. Layers are recommended\u2014a light jacket for the morning chill, but perhaps a cozy sweater as the sun takes its place above. The day is favored for simple pleasures, a chance to engage with the beauty of the city in an unhurried manner.",
