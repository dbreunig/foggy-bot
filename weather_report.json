    "weather_report": "As evening falls over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle breeze carries whispers of the night as temperatures settle around a mild 53 degrees. The skies hold a partly cloudy demeanor, a canvas of shifting clouds playing with the fading light. A brisk west wind, dancing at 21 mph, occasionally flirts with a stronger gust, lending an invigorating freshness to the air, hinting at the cool embrace of the Pacific. The fog, that familiar companion of the Bay, hovers just out of reach, likely lurking beyond the Golden Gate, preparing to drape its silken layers over the city come dawn.\n\nLooking ahead to Independence Day, the forecast holds a promise of sunshine, but with a characteristically San Francisco twist. Expect a high nearing 62, dipping gently into the 60s as the day unfolds. The winds will persist, weaving through the streets at 18 to 24 mph, offering both a refreshing lift and a reminder of the city\u2019s ever-changing nature. It would be wise to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a short-sleeve shirt\u2014allowing comfort whether basking in the sun's warmth or retreating into shaded nooks. Such a day invites a stroll along the Embarcadero, a visit to a bustling caf\u00e9, or perhaps a quiet moment on a park bench, soaking in the interplay of light and shadow, and preparing, with contentment, for the celebrations that lie ahead.",
