    "weather_report": "As the midnight hour settles softly over Downtown San Francisco, a curtain of rain showers begins to weave its way through the city. The air is imbued with that quintessential dampness, a precursor to the chill of the night, as temperatures hover around fifty degrees, lifting just slightly in the hours to come. With a gusty south wind whispering at fourteen to seventeen miles per hour, the landscape breathes a desolate beauty, the city\u2019s lights shrouded in a muted veil, blooming quietly in the muted darkness. \n\nBy Monday, the forecast continues along this thread\u2014more rain, a solid blanket of cloudiness wrapping tightly around the skyline, promising a high of around fifty-five, with a slight drop as the afternoon unfolds. The chance of precipitation lingers at eighty percent, making outdoor endeavors seem less appealing. Those venturing out should consider a sturdy raincoat and comfortable shoes that can gracefully tread through puddles, while those seeking solace might find comfort in a cozy caf\u00e9, perhaps delighting in a warm beverage as the storm rustles gently against the windows. Reflecting on the weather\u2019s temperament, while the sights may lack clarity, there is a certain charm in the muted ambiance of a rainy San Francisco day, where quiet moments can blossom amidst the clouds.",
