    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon light bathes the skyline in a clear, refreshing glow, as sunbeams dance over rooftops and cast long shadows across the gentle undulations of the city\u2019s architecture. The air carries a mild chill, with temperatures hovering in the upper fifties, a contrast made more pleasant by the gentle caress of a southwest breeze. While the day starts at a cool 60, it will slowly slip to around 58, allowing for a comfortable escape from the brisk morning, yet still requiring a light jacket. \n\nTonight promises a serene transition as the clouds begin to roll in, with partly cloudy skies making for a tableau of shifting silhouettes against the lingering twilight. As sunset approaches, the temperature will dip to around 46, ideal for cozy gathering spots or a leisurely stroll through the illuminated streets. With the marine layer remaining at bay, the iconic Golden Gate Bridge stands proudly visible, a beckoning call for evening explorations or quiet contemplation from a nearby caf\u00e9. Embrace this delightful outdoor scene with layers to navigate the fluctuating chill, and perhaps indulge in the simple pleasures of a quiet afternoon walk or a friendly gathering at a local eatery as the day winds down.",
