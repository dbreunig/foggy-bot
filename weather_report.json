    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco is awakening to a day graced by the mild embrace of mostly sunny skies. As the sun navigates its climb, temperatures lightly hover around 65, inviting both the wanderers and the contemplative souls to step outside. A gentle westerly breeze, whispering through the streets at 6 to 12 mph, adds a refreshing touch to the atmosphere, making it easier to breathe in the salt-tinged air that dances along the bay\u2019s edge. The remnants of the morning\u2019s fog linger just beyond, a soft blanket hugging the hills and softening the sharp lines of the cityscape. This gentle marine layer, while a familiar companion, is limited to the fringes, allowing the heart of Downtown to bask in clarity with just a hint of coastal mystery.\n\nAs the daylight gently unfurls, one might consider dressing in light layers\u2014a cozy sweater over a t-shirt, perhaps\u2014with a light jacket at the ready for the evening when temperatures dip to around 54. The pleasantly mild conditions invite wandering, meandering through local galleries or perhaps visiting a quaint caf\u00e9 to sip on warm tea while watching the world drift by. For those keen on embracing the outdoors, a stroll along the waterfront promises stunning views where the sun's rays meet the shimmering bay, perfect for a leisurely afternoon of exploration and reflection.",
