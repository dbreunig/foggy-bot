    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds beneath a generous sun, casting a warm glow over the cityscape. With highs reaching a pleasant 68 degrees, the day promises to unfold with clarity and gentle breezes. The west-southwest winds, whispering between 3 to 10 mph, provide a soft caress to early risers, hinting at a day ripe for exploration. \n\nThis early May morning, the city dances between moments of bright sunshine and the occasional drift of fog, remnants of the coastal marine layer lingering just out of reach. Early adventurers might find themselves meandering the parks, perhaps pausing with a coffee at a local caf\u00e9, or savoring the vibrant culture that spreads through the streets. As the sun dips in the afternoon, temperatures will soften to a comfortable 66, making it an ideal time to stroll along the waterfront, where the bay meets the rhythm of the city. Plan for the evening, as the sky shifts to mostly clear and the luscious hues of sunset beckon, bringing a coolness that might invite a light jacket or sweater. \n\nDress in layers to embrace the changing temperatures, allowing for the convenience of comfort as the day unfolds. Simple pursuits, whether it be reading in a sun-drenched plaza or visiting an art gallery, will resonate beautifully with the lighthearted spirit of the day. San Francisco's allure remains strong, as it welcomes all to experience its charm in this lovely weather.",
