    "weather_report": "A soft light brushes across Downtown San Francisco this morning, painting the city in warm hues beneath a striking blue sky. A few wisps of lingering marine layer drift gently in from the west, hinting at the city's characteristic coastal embrace, but they retreat, allowing the sun to dominate the scene for the day. Winds whisk through the streets, their cool embrace a reminder of the Pacific\u2019s presence as they gust to invigorating heights. The forecast suggests a high around 61 degrees, a comfortable state for those seeking a stroll or an afternoon coffee at a favorite caf\u00e9.\n\nAs the sun rises higher, the clarity of the day offers a perfect window to explore the nooks and crannies of the city. About town, you might engage in the simple pleasures: wandering through the Mission District's murals or perhaps sharing a quiet moment at one of the many parks, surrounded by locals enjoying the tranquility. Light layers will serve you well\u2014perhaps a light jacket for the breezy spells, giving way to a cozy sweater as the sun begins to dip. With the evening promising a clear sky that forks between the warmth of the day and the coolness of night, it's a splendid time to watch the skyline change hues at sunset before retreating to a comfy indoor space as the temperature delicately lowers.",
