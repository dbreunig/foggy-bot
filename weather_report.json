    "weather_report": "In the early morning light, Downtown San Francisco awakens beneath a soft blanket of predominantly clear skies, silhouetting the iconic skyline against a hint of haziness that teeters on the edge of morning fog. As the day unfolds, expect temperatures to rise to a comfortable 62 degrees, embraced by a gentle west wind that whispers through the streets, reaching up to 15 mph and occasionally gusting with a playful intensity. The air retains a crispness, a signature of this coastal city, where even the sunniest of days can prompt a light jacket.\n\nToday beckons for leisurely strolls down the Embarcadero or a quiet sip of coffee in one of the many cozy caf\u00e9s lining the streets, where warm aromas and laughter gently mingle. Perhaps a visit to the Ferry Building Farmers Market would stir your senses, as the vibrant stalls burst with fresh produce and local delicacies. With the sun's rays gradually piercing the coolness of the morning, the city calls for a day filled with calm exploration, where the spirit of adventure meets the serenity of a carefree holiday. Dress in layers\u2014a light sweater should suffice as the cool winds flit about, but the sun may coax you to shed that layer as the day unfolds.",
