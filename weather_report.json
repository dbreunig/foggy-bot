    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day begins with a gentle embrace from the Pacific breeze, teasing a hint of warmth amid the coolness in the air. A subtle veil of clouds lingers, suggesting that the sun may peek through periodically, but the marine layer casts a muted hue across the landscape\u2014a comforting gray that evokes the city\u2019s unique charm. As the afternoon progresses, conditions will shift, allowing for a slight chance of rain after five, but it\u2019s likely that most of the day will remain dry, with soft sunlight occasionally breaking through, painting the city in delicate shades of ochre and azure.\n\nTonight, expect a more overcast retreat, as clouds deepen and the likelihood of rain increases, with gentle drops teasing at the edges of the evening. A low of 62 will add a crispness to the air, so layering becomes a wise choice\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a comfortable tee, making room for both warmth and ease as you navigate the city\u2019s inviting streets. Should wanderlust strike, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront might reveal stunning views of the infamous fog rolling in, or a cozy caf\u00e9 beckons for a moment of serenity over a warm drink, as the day transitions into night. The conditions may not be perfect, but they hold their own subtle beauty, inviting you to embrace the rhythm of a fog-kissed city.",
