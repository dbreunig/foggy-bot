The atmosphere is quite cloudy, setting the stage for a day that teeters between the mystery of the marine layer and the promise of sunshine. A gentle wind rustles through the streets at modest speeds, stirring the air with a refreshing touch that complements the brisk temperature settling around 56 degrees. \n\nAs the sun rises high, it will coax the fog into retreat. By late morning, expect the skies to clear, unveiling a delightful warmth that hovers around 70 degrees before gradually easing down as afternoon approaches. The character of the day shifts to one of brightness, with occasional gusts breathing life into the scenery. For those taking to the city\u2019s streets, comfort is key; a light jacket paired with layers is advisable, as the coolness will still linger in the shadows, especially by the coast. This temperate day invites casual explorations\u2014consider a leisurely stroll through the vibrant neighborhoods or perhaps a visit to one of the many coffee shops that define the local culture. In this evolving atmosphere, each moment offers a fresh flavor, allowing for the simple pleasures to unfold amid the city's storied backdrop.",
