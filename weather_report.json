Tonight's low drops to a crisp 50 degrees, inviting residents to wrap themselves in light layers\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater or a soft scarf. The morning promises a slow awakening; as dawn breaks, expect the clouds to part slightly, revealing moments of sunshine amongst the lingering hues of gray.\n\nSunday will unfurl with a parting of the clouds, offering glimpses of blue amidst the gray, with highs reaching for a comfortable 62 degrees. However, as the afternoon creeps in, temperatures will ease back toward the 60s, gently reminding everyone to embrace the layers they donned earlier. The air may feel cool, particularly against the backdrop of the bay, where a subtle marine layer might cling close to the water, inviting a touch of chill that lingers in the shadows of the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nFor those looking to seize the day, a stroll along the Embarcadero could prove to be a soothing endeavor, allowing for introspection against the backdrop of sailboats dancing across the water. Alternatively, a cozy corner caf\u00e9 beckons, where the rich aromas of brewing coffee will warm both heart and spirit. Today\u2019s conditions call for practicality acknowledged with a hint of local flavor\u2014a chance to embrace the beauty of a typically moody San Francisco day.",
