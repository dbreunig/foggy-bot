    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a pristine blue sky, with brilliant sunlight pouring down, painting the city in warm hues. The day is expected to remain largely sunny, though a gentle transition to cooler temperatures in the afternoon will occur, inviting a distinct yet pleasant chill. With mostly clear conditions persisting into the evening, tonight promises a tranquil clarity under the stars, though temperatures will dip, reminding us of the San Francisco night's embrace.\n\nAs you step outside, a light wind from the northwest carries hints of spring, perfect for a light jacket or layers that you can easily shed as the sun arcs higher. You might stroll along the Embarcadero or the Mission District, taking in some of the vibrant street art and local cafes, allowing the day\u2019s warmth to rejuvenate your spirit. With the clarity of the sky, this afternoon is ideal for a leisurely walk or perhaps a quiet moment in a sun-dappled park, soaking in the serene atmosphere of the city.",
