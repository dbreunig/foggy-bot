    "weather_report": "As night descends over Downtown San Francisco, a soft blanket of clouds gathers, cloaked in shades of gray, whispering of moisture that may grace our streets by dawn. The chill nips at exposed skin, with temperatures hovering around 49 degrees and a gentle southwest wind guiding the evening along its course. The forecast hints at a possible light rain after 4 a.m., with a mere 30% chance of it materializing, contributing to an air thick with anticipation. \n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the city awakens to a landscape veiled in a touch of fog, typical for this coastal realm. Cloudy mornings often drift into clearer afternoons, with a high nearing 59. It paints a picture of a day where warmth will gently retreat as the sun makes its mark, but those early hours might retain a youthful chill that begs for a warm jacket or a cozy sweater. Early risers could find solace in a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero, the promise of rain in the air counterbalanced by the rhythmic sound of waves lapping on the shore. In the embrace of a San Francisco morning, one might savor a quiet coffee at a local spot, watching the clouds dance above\u2014ensuring a grounding experience amid the bustling life that defines this iconic city.",
