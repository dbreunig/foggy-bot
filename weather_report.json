    "weather_report": "The morning ushers in a typically fog-kissed San Francisco day, with the remnants of the marine layer clinging softly to the hills. As the sun gradually breaks through, the atmosphere dances between partly sunny and just a hint of a gray blanket overhead. The temperatures hover around a crisp 58 degrees, inviting light layers for those venturing out. A gentle west wind, whispering at 7 to 10 mph, stirs the air, bringing the scents of the bay and awakening the city.\n\nAs we transition into the evening, expect a clear sky to wrap the day with a warmth that settles around 49 degrees. This evening\u2019s calmness beckons residents to stroll along the waterfront, perhaps stopping for a warm beverage or to indulge in the city\u2019s vibrant culinary scene. With the tranquility of a mostly clear night ahead, layering up in a light jacket will ensure comfort while enjoying the twinkling lights of the city. For the afternoon adventures, contemplate seeking out one of the city's hidden parks or enjoying the serene ambiance of a quiet caf\u00e9.",
