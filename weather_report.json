    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a tranquil scene unfolds beneath the partly cloudy sky. The temperature hovers near 47 degrees, softened by a west-northwest wind whispering through the streets at about 10 to 15 mph. The night air has a crispness, a freshness that invites contemplative walks along the waterfront, where the subtle sound of the tides meets the shore. While the faintest hint of fog may gather at the edges of the bay, it lingers far from the city, allowing a clear view of the shimmering lights that twinkle like stars scattered across the earth.\n\nOn the morrow, a mostly sunny day beckons\u2014a welcome shift where the high approaches a comfortable 57 degrees, only slightly cooling in the afternoon. The winds will remain gentle, promising a comfortable atmosphere fit for leisurely pursuits. With such clarity expected, this presents a perfect opportunity for a stroll through the bustling streets or perhaps a leisurely visit to one of the many art galleries showcasing local talent. Dressing in layers would be wise; a light sweater over a casual shirt, paired with some comfortable shoes, will prepare you for both the warmth of midday and the coolness that lingers in the shadows. Engage in the everyday wonders of a San Francisco afternoon, whether indulging in the local coffee culture or simply enjoying a moment of quiet reflection in a sunlit corner of a park.",
