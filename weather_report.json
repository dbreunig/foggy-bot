    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over Downtown San Francisco, a tranquil palette of blue accompanies the season's slight summer warmth. The city basks under a radiant sky, harmonizing with temperatures hovering in the mid-sixties. With a gentle southwest breeze rustling through the streets, the atmosphere feels comfortably brisk, yet the hints of warmth promise a pleasant day ahead. \n\nDespite the sun\u2019s confident ascent, the morning reveals residual whispers of fog lingering near the coast, particularly around the Golden Gate Bridge, where the marine layer refuses to relinquish its hold just yet. But this silent veil of cloud will gradually dissipate, allowing the city to bask fully in its golden rays, fostering a sense of invigoration that beckons for exploration. Dress in layers to embrace the day\u2019s transitions: start with a light sweater and perhaps a stylish scarf, shedding them as the warmth wraps around your shoulders. Today is perhaps best spent wandering through the crisscrossing streets, discovering a hidden coffee shop or revisiting a favorite corner of a spacious park. Whether it\u2019s a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment at your favorite vista point, the day invites you to embrace its simplicity and charm.",
