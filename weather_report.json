    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this morning, the sun peeks through a canvas of clear skies, casting a gentle glow over the city. As the day unfolds, temperatures will reach a comfortable 64 degrees before settling to a cooler 62 in the afternoon. With a soft west-southwest breeze whispering through at 7 to 15 mph and occasional gusts nudging up to 22, the air carries a refreshing crispness that invigorates yet does not overwhelm. Tonight, as dusk unfolds, expect a gentle transition to partly cloudy skies with temperatures dipping to around 52, offering a cool embrace as the evening sets in.\n\nThe clarity of the day is remarkable, perhaps inviting a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero where the bay offers its shimmering allure. For those inclined to take a moment with a book, a cozy caf\u00e9 patio might serve as the perfect spot, the fresh air mingling with the aroma of coffee. Light layers will be your trusted companions\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket for the cooler moments, and comfortably breathable fabrics to enjoy the warmth without feeling constrained. In a city that reverberates with life, today holds the promise of simple joys, whether you choose to wander through parks or engage in the quiet reflection that these mild, sunlit hours bring.",
