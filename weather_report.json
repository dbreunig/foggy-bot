The overnight clouds blanket the city, cloaking it in a serene stillness that holds the promise of moisture-laden droplets, though the breeze whispers softly from the southwest. As morning gives way to day, expect a curious dance between partly sunny intervals and the erratic flirtation of rain beginning after five o'clock. The horizon will temper your expectations with temperatures hovering around a modest 62 degrees, gradually receding as the afternoon unfolds, with brisk gusts catching you off guard\u2014upwards of 21 mph\u2014so be prepared for nature\u2019s playful whims.\n\nDress in layers that allow you to embrace both warmth and the sudden coolness of the wind. A light jacket might serve well, while a comfortable pair of shoes invites you to wander the city\u2019s storied streets, perfect for that casual cafe crawl or a gentle promenade along the waterfront. Given the time of day, a leisurely stroll with a steaming cup of coffee or tea will be an enjoyable escape. Grab a seat outside, and allow the mist and backdrop of fog to wrap you in a moment of reflection as you watch the day slowly yield to evening.",
