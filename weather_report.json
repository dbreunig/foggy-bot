    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco beneath a welcoming sun, casting a gentle glow over the majestic cityscape. Though the temperature is set to peak at a modest 61 degrees, a crisp west-southwest breeze stirs the air, adding a lively energy while making it feel cooler than it truly is. The promise of warmth lingers in the air, but one might still wish for the comfort of a light jacket, especially as the day transitions into evening and the mercury dips to around 50.\n\nAs the sun dips lower, the sky carries a quiet canvas of partly cloudy tones, with whispers of marine fog lurking just out of sight. The marine layer, typical of this coastal haven, may still weave its way through the valleys and the more hidden spots of the city. While the day may appear radiant, the spirit of the Bay holds onto a certain mystery, inviting admirers to explore its quieter corners\u2014perhaps a stroll through one of the lush parks or a casual gathering at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, sipping something warm as the cool breeze tousles your hair. It's a perfect time to bask in the ethereal charm of the city, embracing the unique blend of tranquility and invigorating vibrancy that makes San Francisco truly enchanting.",
