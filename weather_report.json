    "weather_report": "As the sun gently stirs beneath the horizon, a thick veil of clouds lingers overhead, presenting a predominantly cloudy overnight scene in Downtown San Francisco. The calm southwest winds whisper through the streets, bringing a mild chill that wraps around the city like a familiar embrace. Though the dawn is yet to fully break, hints of brightness linger on the edges of the horizon, promising a sketch of sun-drenched moments in the day ahead.\n\nCome Sunday, the clouds will part to reveal a canvas of mostly sunny skies, as the warmth peaks at a pleasant sixty-two degrees before softly ebbing into coolerafternoon temperatures. The west-southwest winds will pick up, gently stirring the day, while occasional gusts may add a touch of excitement to the otherwise tranquil atmosphere. Expect to encounter a light marine layer, where coastal fog dances just beyond the Golden Gate, subtly reminding us of the ocean\u2019s embrace even as daylight stretches its fingers across the city.\n\nDressing for the day calls for layers; a light jacket or sweater in the morning and a comfortable top underneath to adapt to the warmth as the sun rises. As the day blossoms, it would be a perfect time to wander down hidden alleyways, toast to new connections at a cozy caf\u00e9, or perhaps lose oneself in the resplendent beauty of Golden Gate Park as it bathes in the sun, inviting gentle strolls and reflective moments.",
