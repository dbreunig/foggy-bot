    "weather_report": "As dusk descends on Downtown San Francisco, a thick veil of clouds softens the evening light, painting the skyline in understated grays and muted blues. The air, holding a cool 54 degrees, whispers hints of the sea as a gentle west-southwest breeze stirs through the streets. Tonight, the sky may seem largely draped in clouds, yet the promise of clarity lingers, suggesting the fog, which characteristically dances around the Golden Gate, might linger lower down while the city above remains serene.\n\nThe morrow beckons with the sun\u2019s anticipated return, ushering in a day that turns largely sunny. Temperatures will rise modestly, reaching a pleasant high around 64 degrees before a gradual descent in the afternoon to a softer 62, complementing the day\u2019s rhythm. A lightweight jacket or layered attire will be your trusted companion, ideal for the cool morning air and the mild warmth that often graces the afternoon. As the world awakens and the sun breaks through the cloud cover, today is ripe for casual strolls along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where one can indulge in a quiet moment over coffee and pastries, all while watching the city transition into evening.",
