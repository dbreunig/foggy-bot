    "weather_report": "In the gentle embrace of early dawn, Downtown San Francisco awakens under a shroud of patchy drizzle\u2014a soft whisper of moisture that hints at the lingering marine layer. The sky, a muted canvas of gray, casts a subdued light over the city, wrapping it in a cool blanket, with temperatures hovering around 59 degrees. As the day unfolds, the morning drizzle is set to retreat, making way for the sun\u2019s gradual ascent, coaxing the atmosphere to transform into a palate of warm golden hues, though a receding chill will linger, especially as the afternoon approaches.\n\nAs the sun breaks through the clouds, expect a high of 67, dipping slightly in the afternoon. The west wind, a brisk companion, will dance through the streets at 7 to 15 miles per hour, stirring the air and reminding us of autumn's advance. The fog, a fleeting visitor, may still cling to the edges of the Golden Gate but will likely yield to clearer skies as the morning matures. Dress in layers\u2014a light sweater or jacket will serve well for the brisk morning, easing into lighter clothing as the warmth of the day evolves. Given the captivating interplay of sunshine and clouds, a leisurely stroll through the parks or along the waterfront could be the perfect way to relish the city's charm, allowing one to immerse in the changing landscape of an ever-energetic city while savoring a hot cup of coffee from a local caf\u00e9.",
