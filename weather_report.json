    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the sky opens up to a wide canvas of serene blue, painted gently by the sun's early rays. This morning feels pleasantly mild, with temperatures lingering comfortably in the low sixties, a fitting welcome for the day ahead. Afternoon glimpses of the skyline promise the warmth of 65, though a whisper of chill may brush softly against your skin as the sun begins to dip toward the horizon. The gentle north-northwest wind stirs, carrying with it the crispness of the bay, inviting moments spent wandering.\n\nTonight, the sky will transition into a richly textured tapestry of clouds, gently surrounding a low that settles around 51 degrees. This inviting, cool air beckons you to layer lightly; a cardigan or a light jacket will suffice as the evening unfolds into a quiet, starlit interlude. Without the weight of fog obscuring the iconic landmarks, it\u2019s a perfect day to grab a coffee from your favorite caf\u00e9 and find a spot along the waterfront, or perhaps take a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park, absorbing the rich scents of springtime blooms before nightfall blankets the city.",
