The day shines bright, with temperatures poised near a cool 65 degrees, the kind of warmth that beckons a light jacket or a cozy cardigan. The winds, emboldened by the west, dance briskly through the streets, whispering reminders of the day\u2019s unyielding punctuation, gusting up to 30 mph. This sharp breeze stirs the leaves and ruffles the hair of pedestrians, adding an exhilarating element to the calm ambiance.\n\nTonight, the skies will shift toward a deeper clarity, though the warmth of the day gives a reassuring embrace amidst the chilly air settling into the evening. As the temperatures dip to around 56 degrees, attire will best be layered\u2014embracing comfort with a mid-weight jacket to fend off the coolness while still savoring the remnants of the day, whether it\u2019s a stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment in one of the city's inviting parks. Given the current sunlight\u2014a rarity in summer\u2019s embrace\u2014you may find inspiration to forage for a quiet caf\u00e9, where a warm drink can be enjoyed at the window, or to venture into the golden hues of the evening, letting the city\u2019s illuminated charms wash over you.",
