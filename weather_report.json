The skies are mostly clear, a canvas of deepening blues stretching toward the horizon.

A pleasant evening awaits, with the city aglow in the last vestiges of twilight.\n\nTransitioning into tomorrow, expect a sunlit day marked by mostly sunny skies, where highs near 66 will cool slightly to around 64 as the afternoon unfolds. The winds shall continue their playful ballet, shifting to 6 to 15 mph. With no fog shrouding the golden towers and bridges, it's an opportune moment to venture out\u2014perhaps a leisurely walk along the waterfront or a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many parks. For those planning to embrace the outdoor charm, consider layers; a light sweater paired with comfortable shoes would be wise to prepare for the occasional chill that can weave through the afternoon. San Francisco\u2019s beauty beckons; let the city\u2019s vibrant rhythm guide your exploration under clear, open skies.",
