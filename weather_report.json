With a gentle north-northwest breeze, the air is cool and carries the faint scent of moisture, as there lies a 40% chance that the clouds will spill their contents after the witching hour. Currently, temperatures hover near a brisk 50 degrees, a reminder that the chill of winter lingers. Tonight's potential drizzle is not only a dance upon the rooftops but a soft lullaby, inviting introspection and quiet contemplation.\n\nTomorrow holds a similar promise with shifting skies and a high near 57. Through breaks in the clouds, the sun may seek to pierce the gray, lighting an afternoon that will yield a cooler breeze, reaching down to around 53. With gusts on the stronger side, you might want to wear layers that can shift easily\u2014a light jacket paired with a cozy sweater could harmonize comfortably with the day's playful warmth and the chill that follows. Such nuanced weather calls for mundane pleasures: perhaps a stroll through Embarcadero's waterfront, savoring a warm cup of coffee as you watch commerce unfold or a quiet expedition through one of the city\u2019s rich museums, embracing the vibrant culture warmed by the promise of the sun\u2019s eventual return.",
