    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a bright, sunlit sky, sharply contrasting with the city's usual tapestry of fog. The clarity is striking, with visibility extended over the landscape, revealing a panorama of the Golden Gate Bridge standing proud against the azure backdrop. As the temperature begins to settle around a comfortable 65 degrees, a gentle westward breeze whispers through the streets, offering a refreshing touch to the warm afternoon. The marine layer, typically known for casting its ethereal shroud, seems absent today, allowing San Francisco's architectural gems to bask in the sun\u2019s golden glow.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect a smooth transition into a partly cloudy evening. The air cools slightly, settling around 56 degrees, making it wise to don a light jacket or sweater for comfort during an evening stroll. In light of these graciously pleasant conditions, consider taking a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero to witness the sunset reflecting off the bay. Perhaps stop at a cozy caf\u00e9 for a few moments of quiet contentment, or simply enjoy the vibrant city life from one of the nearby parks. Tonight invites a tranquil connection with the outdoors, enhanced by the fading warmth of the day and the calming presence of the evening breeze.",
