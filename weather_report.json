Fog may linger at the edges, offering dramatic views of the Golden Gate Bridge while the city remains clear and vibrant inland. For the discerning San Franciscan or intrepid visitor, today promises a lovely interplay of clouds and sun\u2014the perfect reason to step outside and immerse oneself in the city's charming bustle or the tranquility of its parks.",
