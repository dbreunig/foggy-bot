    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the early hours breathe a cool, dampness into the air, with a gentle drizzle whispering against the pavement. The sky hangs mostly cloudy overhead, an expanse of muted grays offering only a modest glow from the hidden sun. As the chill settles in, the temperature hovers comfortably around 58 degrees, accompanied by a light breeze from the west, nudging through the streets like a soft sigh.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the morning's drizzle to dissipate, yielding to patches of sun that strive to reclaim the sky. While the high will cap around 66, a gradual retreat to about 64 in the afternoon hints at a day that won\u2019t rise too extravagantly above the coolness inherited from the night. Winds may pick up, rustling through trees and along sidewalks, reminding those who wander that layering will be prudent. A light jacket or cardigan would serve well against the brisk touch of wind. \n\nToday beckons thoughtful ventures\u2014perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the air carries hints of salt and sea, or a quiet caf\u00e9 visit nestled within the Mission, where the warmth of good company and fresh pastries can content the soul. As fog lingers in the distance, the marine layer wraps parts of the Golden Gate, a soft shroud that invites reflection. Enjoy these nuances of the day, where beauty lies not just in the sunlight, but also in the moody grace of a city that embraces its own rhythm.",
