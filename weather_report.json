    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a refreshing chill, hinting at the gentle embrace of a mild summer day. The city awakens under a partially cloudy sky, and temperatures hover serenely at around fifty-four degrees, flanked by a light southwest breeze that nudges the morning along. While the sun is yet to peek fully through, a sense of promise lingers in the air, heralding a day of bright sunshine, likely to rise near seventy degrees as midday draws closer. \n\nAs the hours unfurl, the clouds will dissipate, making way for the golden orb to warm the streets, though the afternoon may see temperatures cool slightly, offering relief in the form of a fresh Southern breeze. Fog, however, remains kept at bay for now, with no sign of the characteristic marine layer that often blankets the bay. For those navigating the early hours, light layers would suffice\u2014perhaps a light jacket or cardigan to ward off the dampness of night that lingers still. With the day brightening, a stroll along the Embarcadero could be delightful, perhaps culminating in a coffee at a local caf\u00e9 where one can soak in the burgeoning vibrancy of the city. Embrace the midweek charm, with plans as unhurried as the rising sun.",
