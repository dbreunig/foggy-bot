    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, this afternoon unfolds with a rare brilliance, the sun casting a warm glow over a city that often cloaks itself in mist. The temperature swells to a comfortable 66 degrees, gradually retreating to a gentle 64 as the late afternoon whispers its arrival. A brisk wind from the west dances through the streets, invigorating the senses with hints of salt from the nearby sea. The clarity is striking\u2014the skies are a pale blue canvas, unmarred except by wisps of white that suggest the marine layer, lingering at the coast but holding its distance.\n\nAs the evening approaches, a gentle calm will settle in, with temperatures dipping to a cool 53 degrees. The winds will ease, inviting the city\u2019s charm to linger into the night, softening the edges of the day. This delightful weather beckons outdoor activities; perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero to savor the sunset as it casts a golden hue over the bay, or a visit to one of the many hidden cafes where the aroma of fresh pastries mingles with the cool air. Dressing in layers will offer comfort; a light jacket will suffice against the evening chill, pairing well with a casual outfit perfect for spectacularly ordinary moments.",
