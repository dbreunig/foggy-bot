    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, there's a soft clarity to the morning sky, kissed by the low-hanging light of early day. The serene hills cradle the city, revealing a panorama imbued with promise, but whispers of impending rain drift on the air, heralding a change. With the temperature hovering around a cool 58 degrees, the day stands in quiet contrast, likely to yield to the chill of afternoon as it surrenders gradually to an overcast embrace. A gentle breeze from the west, not quite a whisper but felt, offers comfort through the morning chill.\n\nAs the day deepens, clouds will gather, manifesting the promise of rain after nightfall. Tonight, nestled under these blankets of cloud, temperatures will dip to a crisp 49. The certainty of a 90% chance of precipitation calls for preparedness. The marine layer may stretch over the Golden Gate, cloaking the bridge in a soft veil, while the rest of the city enjoys dappled sunny spells. As you navigate this day, consider light layers to adapt to the shifting tones of warmth and coolness. A light jacket or sweater will serve well against the morning\u2019s cool caress, and an umbrella surely will be a faithful companion into the evening. With rain on the horizon, it may be the perfect occasion to wander through the warmth of a cozy caf\u00e9, perhaps with a book in hand or a dear friend to share in conversation, sheltering from the rain\u2019s gentle taps against the windows.",
