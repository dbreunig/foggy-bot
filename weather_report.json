    "weather_report": "As the quiet hum of early morning envelops Downtown San Francisco, the air is saturated with a cool dampness that hints at the residual fog lingering from the night. This morning's mostly cloudy sky, adorned with a soft blanket of gray, barely teases the sun, which seeks its stage above. A mild low of around 58 provides subtle comfort, though the gentle southwest wind stirs as it whispers through the streets, currently calm but capable of lively gusts by afternoon.\n\nAs the day unfolds, a transformation is expected; the clouds will yield to a mostly sunny sky. Daytime highs will flirt with 69, sliding slightly down to 67 as afternoon sets in, inviting warmer layers to be shed or amended. The promise of such brightness calls for a stroll through the Presidio or a leisurely brunch at a local caf\u00e9, perhaps, with a quaint breeze urging you to stay a while. With comfortable temperatures and the gentle sway of the winds\u2014a modest 3 to 14 mph\u2014today could well be one of those serendipitous moments when the city reveals its charm through unfogged vistas and alluring warmth. A light jacket or a cozy cardigan is advisable for those venturing out early or lingering into the cooler twilight.",
