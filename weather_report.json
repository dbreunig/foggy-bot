    "weather_report": "As night descends over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere paints a scene of gentle tranquility, draped in a blanket of soft clouds. The temperature, steady at a comfortable 50 degrees, invites a cozy wrap of a light jacket or cardigan, an embrace against the whispering winds from the west. The skies are intermittently clear, suggesting a dappled final glow of twilight can still be glimpsed. There is no prominent fog hidden among the hills, just the soft outlines of the city bathed in muted hues, faintly illuminated by distant lights.\n\nAs the clock edges toward a new day, Friday offers a promise of warmth, with the sun poised to emerge, heralding a brighter spectacle. The forecast hints at a mostly sunny disposition with temperatures nudging toward 63, while the afternoon may see a gentle retreat to a cool 61. Attire that layers well will suit this transitioning day perfectly, inviting leisurely strolls through charming neighborhoods or perhaps a quiet coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, where the world can be watched unfold at a leisurely pace. As the city stirs, its character will be revealed, and with this fine balance of climes, it encourages the spirit to wander.",
