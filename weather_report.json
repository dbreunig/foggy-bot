    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle curtain of clouds dances across the sky, offering a brief interlude before nightfall. The temperature, modestly settled around 54 degrees, invites a light sweater or a stylish cardigan to ward off the cool air wafting in from the southwest at a leisurely 6 to 10 mph. The whispers of the wind carry a promise of a pleasant night, with the kind of ambiance perfect for a contemplative walk along the waterfront or a quiet gathering in the comforting corners of a neighborhood caf\u00e9.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the city is poised for a transition into warmth. A radiant sun will herald in the day, pushing temperatures to a comfortable near 67 degrees, followed by a gentle decline in the afternoon. With a delightful southwest breeze dancing at 6 to 13 mph, those venturing out will find the day inviting, perhaps optimal for a leisurely visit to the local bookstores or a peaceful afternoon at a nearby park, absorbing the vibrant life that the city offers. However, for the morning, it would be wise to dress in layers, allowing for a transition from the cooler morning chill to the sunlit warmth of midday, making it a lovely day to explore, to linger, and to appreciate the aesthetics of this eclectic city, unmarred by fog or haze.",
