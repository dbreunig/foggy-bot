    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, today unfolds under a sunny embrace, the horizon punctuated by golden rays that coax the city awake. The high temperature flirts around the mid-60s, a fleeting warmth that ebbs as the afternoon approaches, ushering in a gentle chill carried by the west wind. While the skyline remains mostly clear, the promise of warmth may coax those bundled in jackets to shed a layer or two, but a light sweater could still be a wise companion as the day transitions into evening. As dusk draws near, the brilliant sun will yield to a quilt of partially cloudy skies, delicately framing the city in soft shades of twilight.\n\nWith such pleasant conditions, the day invites a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the rhythm of the bay plays a soft backdrop. One might find solace at an outdoor caf\u00e9, sipping on a warm drink while watching the world drift by, or seek quiet in the verdant expanses of Golden Gate Park, where gentle breezes weave through the trees. The elusive marine layer, so often a hallmark of the city, seems to have receded for the moment, though it remains a whisper away, hinting at the nearby Pacific. Dress comfortably, with versatility in mind, as this San Francisco day offers both sun and the promise of chill come nightfall.",
