    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a clear blue sky, welcoming the sun\u2019s gentle warmth as it begins its ascent. The forecast suggests a high hovering close to 62 degrees, providing a delightful contrast to the brisk morning air. As afternoon approaches, temperatures will gracefully settle to around 60, while light winds dance through the streets, barely stirring the calm atmosphere. Tonight promises a retreat into clarity, with a night sky boasting a low near 47, the crisp air beckoning residents to embrace warmth.\n\nWhile the sun shines, the iconic fog that often cloaks the coastal city remains dormant in the distance, with hints of the marine layer retreating inland, allowing for unobstructed views toward landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge. The lack of fog makes for an inviting outdoor experience, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many charming parks. Dressing in layers would be wise, as the billowing warmth of the day can quickly yield to the coolness of the evening, ensuring comfort throughout your afternoon adventures. Whether enjoying a coffee al fresco or exploring a tucked-away street, today invites you to savor the clarity and beauty of a San Francisco winter day.",
