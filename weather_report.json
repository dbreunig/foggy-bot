    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a delightful embrace of sunshine. The day is poised at a comfortable warmth, hovering around 69 degrees before gradually retreating to the mid-60s, letting a gentle breeze, fresh with the touch of the ocean, play through the streets. Although the sun beams down, a brisk west-southwest wind of 13 to 22 mph stirs, bringing with it whispers of the bay and a hint of lively energy to the atmosphere.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will transition into a softer palette, draped in wisps of cloud with a slight chance of drizzle creeping in after midnight. For now, the visibility is quite decent, with fog lingering at the fringes but not overwhelming the landscape. It frames the city rather than enveloping it, allowing for glimpses of the iconic skyline mingled with the distant hills. Dress comfortably, opting for layers to adapt to the mild warmth, complemented by a light jacket for the evening chill. Outdoor gatherings could be pleasant, perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or enjoying a quiet moment in a caf\u00e9, embracing the simple joys this urban haven offers.",
