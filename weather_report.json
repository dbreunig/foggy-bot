As temperatures hover near 67 degrees, you'll likely find many ladies and gentlemen out and about, jackets whisked away as the winds whisper in from the west. With gusts reaching 23 mph, one might feel a playful tug against their garments, invigorating yet amiable, nudging you toward the promise of the outdoors.\n\nAs the day gracefully flows into the evening, the lingering warmth is set to descend to a cozy 56 degrees. The west-southwest winds, now tamed, offer a softer touch, their coolness brushing against the skin, a reminder of the ocean\u2019s embrace. Tonight promises a mostly clear sky, where the bright stars may twinkle above, inviting a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps an evening visit to one of the city\u2019s quaint cafes. With such delightful weather, consider donning a light sweater for the chillier moments and allow the crisp air to invigorate your spirit. Evening activities could range from a walk along the waterfront to enjoying a peaceful read at a nearby park\u2014simple pleasures in the city's charming embrace.",
