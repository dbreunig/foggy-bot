    "weather_report": "As night blankets Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of fog begins to weave through the city streets, softening the harsh lines of architecture against the embracing clouds. The hushed whispers of raindrops before dawn linger in the air, promising the possibility of dampness that could grace the sidewalks. Temperatures hover in the low fifties, a coolness that calls for a light jacket, or perhaps a cozy scarf to ward off the chill as one ventures outside. The winds, though mild, wander through alleys and avenues, carrying the scent of the bay and damp earth.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the city wakes under a hopeful sun seeking to break through the clouds. The day invites exploration, with hints of sunshine promising to coax temperatures near sixty. Those venturing out may find pleasure in a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet coffee in a nook, where the warmth of a cup can be appreciated against the soft chill of the morning. Choose attire that layers well; a cardigan over a light shirt can adapt as the sun's rays dance through the lingering fog. Embrace the serenity of a mid-week day, perhaps offering a perfect backdrop for a short visit to a local gallery or an impromptu walk to rediscover the city\u2019s iconic landmarks, shrouded today in a serene, hazy mystery.",
