    "weather_report": "As another day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a gentle promise of moisture, with patchy drizzle anticipated after the witching hour. The temperature rests comfortably at around 56 degrees, cloaked in a mostly cloudy mantle. A light west-southwest wind whispers through the city, hinting at a soft, drizzly serenade that might linger through the morning hours, offering a refreshingly cool embrace to night owls and early risers alike.\n\nTomorrow's promise reveals itself: skies will gradually part to reveal rays of sunshine, transforming the atmosphere into a muted, yet inviting tableau. As the day stretches toward lunchtime, a high near 62 will beckon those wishing to escape the confines of their cozy abodes. In this temperate haven, one might opt for layered attire\u2014perhaps a light sweater beneath a breezy jacket, perfectly suited for the dance between fickle clouds and tentative sunshine. With the absence of heavy fog, the marine layer will playfully drift, kissing the edges of the iconic Golden Gate, inviting urban explorers to stroll along the waterfront promenade or savor a quiet moment over a warm cup of coffee in one of the city\u2019s many cozy cafes. \n\nAt this hour, even as the city settles into slumber, there is a feeling of untold stories waiting for the dawn\u2014each voice in the soft drizzle, an invitation to linger and appreciate the unique calm of an early San Francisco morning.",
