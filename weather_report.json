    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the skies embrace a patchwork of clouds, revealing an inviting coolness that hints at the whispers of early spring. The air is crisp, with temperatures dipping gently into the mid-forties, wrapped in a soft west-northwest breeze that stirs the urban glow. Tonight, the city shimmers under the remnants of daylight, a tapestry of city lights winking like stars, while the winds create a delicate rustle among the rooftops.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the forecast offers a promise of mostly sunny skies that bloom into a bright yet tender day. As the sun climbs toward its zenith, temperatures will hover in the high fifties, dropping slightly as the afternoon unfolds. The gentle northwest winds will carry a coolness, making it a fine moment for a stroll around the neighborhood or perhaps a visit to one of the nearby caf\u00e9s. Dress in layers: a light jacket paired with a comfortable shirt would suit the city's unpredictable embrace, allowing you to peel back the layers as the warmth creeps in, and now is the ideal time to wander along the waterfront or pop into a local bookstore, losing track of time amidst the pages of an old favorite. The absence of the marine layer lends clarity to the day ahead, ensuring that the golden hues of sunset will paint the sky in a resplendent display, urging you to seize the beauty that San Francisco unfailingly promises.",
