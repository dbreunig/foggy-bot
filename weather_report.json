    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a sunlit sky, a rare interlude of clarity amid the often-fickle seasonal fog. The temperature hovers around a crisp sixty-two degrees, but you might feel a slight chill as the day wanes, settling towards fifty-nine. As the golden light of day stretches towards dusk, a gentle west wind carries the refreshing breath of the bay, adding to the pleasantness of the strolls along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many parks. Although the horizon is mostly clear, hints of a marine layer linger just beyond the Golden Gate, suggesting that the infamous fog may creep in later tonight.\n\nAs the evening progresses, expect the sky to don a slightly more subdued attire, partly cloudy but still inviting. Dress in layers, perhaps donning a light sweater or a jacket, to balance against the coolness that will soon settle in. The evening is perfect for quiet exploration\u2014whether it\u2019s savoring a warm cup of coffee at a cherished caf\u00e9 or taking a leisurely walk with friends along the waterfront to breathe in the beauty of the bay.",
