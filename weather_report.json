The air carries a hint of cool humidity, whispering of a slight chance of drizzle later tonight. The west-southwest winds weave through the streets, bringing a brisk touch, making it a night for layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket or a cozy sweater.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of a mostly sunny day offers both a reprieve from the clouds and a gentle invitation to venture outside. Drizzle may flirt with the morning hours, but by midday, the sun will assert its presence, warming the air to a comfortable mildness just above sixty. Given the lingering marine layer, one might spot the fog retreating back into the bay, leaving behind a playful atmosphere ripe for exploration. A leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or a simple caf\u00e9 visit tucked within an inviting alley might be on the agenda\u2014a perfect way to embrace the day, savoring a moment of calm amidst the city\u2019s rhythm.",
