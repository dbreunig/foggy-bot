    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is draped in a soft blanket of clouds, evoking a refreshing yet muted charm typical of early June. As sunset draws near, the chill of the evening beckons. Current temperatures hover around the lower 60s, a gentle reminder to layer up. The occasional whisper of drizzle, lingering like distant memories, dissipates as the day unfolds, leaving a stage set for muted sunshine to break through the cloud cover. There\u2019s a hint of the marine layer still clinging to the hills, gently suggesting a dance between land and sea.\n\nAs the winds blow from the west-southwest, carrying the salty air of the bay, they invite you to step outside and partake in the city\u2019s understated beauty. With gusts reaching up to 29 mph, a light jacket will serve as a faithful companion to shield you from the brisk breezes. An afternoon stroll along the waterfront could be just the remedy for the soul, as the San Francisco scenery transforms under the fading light\u2014viewing the elegant silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge framed by low-hanging clouds might just capture your heart. Alternatively, a quiet afternoon in a local caf\u00e9, cradling a warm cup, would be an excellent way to embrace the day\u2019s ambiance, allowing fleeting moments to unravel while the city pulses with its typical vibrancy.",
