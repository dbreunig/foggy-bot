    "weather_report": "As the sun settles into its slumber, Downtown San Francisco wraps itself in a gentle embrace of twilight. The air carries a cool breath, whispering hints of fog that huddle close to the bay. Tonight's chill kisses the skin, dropping to a comfortable low, perfect for a light jacket. Above, a quilt of clouds cloaks the heavens, bringing a promise of patchy fog after midnight that may morph the skyline into a dreamlike tableau. \n\nMonday will dawn softly, the morning likely veiled in a fleeting mist, but as the day progresses, that fog will lift, revealing patches of gray and blue in the afternoon sky, with temperatures teetering in the low sixties. A casual stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps with coffee in hand, seems an ideal way to embrace the milky light filtering through the clouds. The cool southwesterly breeze serves as a reminder of the ocean's proximity, encouraging layers to ward off the evening's chill as one finds solace in quiet caf\u00e9s or lively bookstores. Dress comfortably\u2014think breathable fabrics topped with a snug cardigan\u2014and let the city's gentle vibrancy guide your evening plans.",
