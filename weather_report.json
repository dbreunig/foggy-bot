    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the skies are a pristine canvas painted in hues of early morning clarity, promising a delightful day ahead. The sun graces the horizon with a gentle glow, heralding a high close to 61 degrees, while the cool breeze dances lightly at 5 to 10 miles per hour from the northwest. The absence of any significant fog or marine layer invites a warmth that suggests an ideal setting for both the early riser strolling through the city\u2019s historic streets and the office worker making their way to the day's endeavors.\n\nAs the day unfolds, temperatures will ease slightly, settling around 58 degrees by afternoon, affording a comfortable atmosphere for a casual midday coffee break or a leisurely lunch outdoors. While the evening beckons with the promise of cooler air and stars beginning to twinkle in a mostly clear sky, a light jacket or sweater may be advisable for your transition into the night. Today invites sweet simplicity: perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a morning pastry, a stroll along the Embarcadero to savor the waterfront views, or a quiet moment spent watching the world go by from a park bench as life ebbs and flows\u2014a living tableau of urban rhythm.",
