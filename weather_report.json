    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a soft embrace of marine air. A gentle morning drizzle may linger, promising just enough moisture to nourish the streets but not enough to dampen the spirits of those beginning their day. With highs predicted to hover around the mid-60s, the temperature offers a comfortable invitation to venture outside, albeit with a light cardigan or a cozy sweater at hand for the afternoon\u2019s cooling descent. \n\nClouds wrap the city in a muted blanket, but they lift just enough to allow streaks of sunlight to peek through, creating a dance of shadows on the iconic buildings. The golden rays cast a warm glow against the mist, hinting at the transient beauty of the day ahead. Locals can expect a playful breeze, with gusts rolling in from the west, tugging at their sleeves but bringing a refreshing touch to the air. The fog, more a subtle companion today, makes its presence felt along the edges of the Golden Gate, softly curling around its towering majesty. As the sun begins its ascent, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or enjoy a peaceful moment in one of the city\u2019s hidden gardens, where the flavors of the season can ignite the senses. The weather whispers of simple pleasures\u2014today is made for quaint coffee shops, book nooks, or a quiet afternoon spent people-watching, as the city reveals its character, balancing rain and shine with effortless charm.",
