    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon is unfurling under the warmth of the sun, illuminating the city with a gentle brilliance. A high near 65 beckons outdoor wanderers, while a steady west-southwest wind dances through the streets, wrapping around the buildings and stirring the leaves. The sky above remains clear, a spacious blue canvas, but hints of the incoming evening suggest a slight chance of drizzle as the city transitions into night. As the hours pass and the temperature dips to around 56, the breeze cools, nudging you to reach for a light sweater or jacket as you head out.\n\nThe overall ambience is one of inviting pleasantness, ideal for a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 where you can savor a warm drink. The slight chance of drizzle after dark adds a cozy touch, creating an opportunity to enjoy the evening while wrapped in soft layers. Take a moment to embrace the city's vibrancy as you wander through its streets, perhaps finding a quiet corner to reflect or experience the gentle rhythm of urban life.",
