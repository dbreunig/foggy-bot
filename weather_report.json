    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls its delicate tendrils across downtown San Francisco, the air is marked by a gentle clarity, tinged with the fresh perfume of coastal breezes. Currently resting at approximately 55 degrees, it\u2019s a pleasant invitation for early risers. The southwest wind whispers softly at around six miles per hour, hinting at the warmth to come as the sun climbs higher in the cerulean sky. Throughout the day, expect golden rays to bathe the city, peaking near 65 before settling back to a cool 61 as afternoon approaches, accompanied by a light west-southwest wind that may rustle the leaves without much fuss.\n\nFor those venturing about this bright Tuesday, attire should be both thoughtful and comfortable: light layers to greet the morning chill and a light jacket to guard against the whisper of the wind might serve well until the sun\u2019s full embrace warms the heart of the day. With such delightful weather beckoning, consider a leisurely stroll through one of the city's charming neighborhoods, or perhaps indulge in a quiet corner of a local caf\u00e9, warming your hands around a cup of coffee while watching the world awaken. Embrace this refreshing day, a gentle reminder of spring\u2019s tender grip on the city that never ceases to inspire.",
