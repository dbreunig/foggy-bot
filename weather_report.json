    "weather_report": "The atmosphere in Downtown San Francisco today is painted with the gentle strokes of sunlit clarity, as the afternoon unfolds into a tapestry of golden warmth, quietly humming at a pleasant 63 degrees. With a robust westerly breeze brushing past, the day is marked by that refreshing San Francisco charm, the kind that reminds you that nature knows how to play the perfect host. While temperatures may dip slightly, hovering around 61, the skies are a bright canvas, devoid of fog or the heavy mantle of the marine layer, allowing for stunning views of city landmarks.\n\nAs evening approaches, the horizon will shift, bringing with it partly cloudy skies settling around 51 degrees, complemented by a steady breeze that brings a crisp touch to the air. It\u2019s a night where layers become your best friend; a light jacket will serve well as you stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps enjoy a quiet caf\u00e9 moment in the charming Mission District. The subtle radiance of the late afternoon makes it an ideal time for leisurely pursuits\u2014perhaps a visit to a local bookshop or an art gallery, where the ambiance remains inviting. All in all, it\u2019s an afternoon that encourages exploration and embraces the simple joys of city life in splendid weather.",
