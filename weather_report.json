    "weather_report": "As we drift through the early morning hours in Downtown San Francisco, the air feels fresh and carries the subtle promise of a mellow day ahead. The sky, still awakening, has begun to reveal itself with patches of blue peeking through, indicating a mostly sunny afternoon that\u2019s predicted to lend warmth and comfort, hovering around a gentle 67 degrees. You might notice the hints of a breeze, whispering through the streets at a brisk 17 mph, stirring leaves and creating a soothing rustle that harmonizes with the city's morning routine.\n\nYet, as the sun sinks later into the evening, anticipate a change in scenery and texture. A light drizzle may brush against your skin come midnight, perhaps awakening a part of you that feels invigorated by such tender, refreshing splashes of nature. With a low of around 57, it\u2019s advisable to dress warmly, perhaps wrapping yourself in a soft sweater or light jacket, as the evening brings forth a shift that could make the air feel cooler against your exposed skin. Although the chances of rain are minimal, the day\u2019s clarity invites chances for contemplation. Whether you choose to stroll along Market Street, exploring local cafes, or enjoy quiet moments with a book at home, the beauty of this city will wrap around you like an old friend, reminding you of its ever-changing charm.",
