    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, a warm embrace of sunshine envelops the city, presenting a delightful scene visible from the heights of Sutro Tower. The skies, a vibrant blue, stretch above with hardly a cloud to disrupt their expanse. As the afternoon approaches, temperatures will gently decline from their peak, creating a comfortable environment for leisurely pursuits. A mild northwest breeze whispers through the streets, enhancing the pleasant atmosphere.\n\nAs the sun dips toward evening, expect the warmth to transition into cooler air, inviting the gathering of light clouds as twilight falls. Dressing in layers will serve you well today, a lightweight sweater or a light long-sleeve beneath a breathable shirt will balance the warmth of the day and the fresh coolness of the evening. This is an opportune day to embrace simple joys\u2014perhaps a walk along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering waters reflect the city skyline, or an intimate caf\u00e9 visit to savor a warm drink as the city\u2019s vibrant energy shifts to a softer, more contemplative rhythm. With these conditions, San Francisco beckons for exploration and connection, both to its landmarks and to one another.",
