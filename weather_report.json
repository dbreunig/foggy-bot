    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a delicate veil of mist begins to creep in from the Pacific, coaxing even the most reluctant of drizzles to linger just beyond the horizon. It\u2019s a night marked by a gentle breeze, inviting a blend of coolness and warmth that envelops the city like a soft embrace. With temperatures hovering around the mild 57 degrees, attire should lean towards comfort\u2014a light jacket layered over a cotton tee should suffice, shielding you from both the brisk wind and the occasional fleeting rain.\n\nTomorrow promises the embrace of more sunlight, but until dawn breaks, the hazy silhouette of the Golden Gate rests like a secret. Expect patchy drizzle to precede the sun, soon giving way to the soft glow of a mostly sunny day. Highs will flirt with 64 degrees before retreating to 62, as a mild west-southwest wind sways through the streets. The marine layer still dances along the coast, lending a tranquil beauty to the bay while setting a tone for understated yet significant adventures\u2014perhaps a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero would yield the kind of peaceful introspection one seeks in such weather, or perhaps a loose gathering of friends at an outdoor cafe beneath a canopy of clouds, sharing stories with laughter carried in the breeze and a promise of clearer days ahead.",
