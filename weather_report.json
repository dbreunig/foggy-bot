    "weather_report": "In the depths of the night, Downtown San Francisco stands shrouded in the whispered embrace of showers and electric murmurs of thunder, a somber canopy of clouds hanging low over the city. The chill settles into the air, hinting at the subtle promise of rain. Approaching dawn will bring little respite, as the day unfolds under a predominantly gray sky, with intermittent showers continuing to aquaint the ground with its crisp, cool touch. Those venturing out should expect blustery winds, dancing lightly around the edges of a once-familiar landscape, adding an edge to daily routines.\n\nAs the sun fights through the clouds by late morning, fleeting glimpses of blue may still be hard to find. However, there lies a whispered promise of clarity in the afternoon, as the storms grow weary and make way for moments of sun\u2014albeit held at bay by a strong breeze. Yet, one must be prepared for sudden shifts, with rain that might return unexpectedly. A layered approach to clothing\u2014perhaps a lightweight waterproof jacket wrapped around a cozy sweater\u2014will suffice to ward off the late-night chill and an impromptu drizzle, keeping you comfortable whether you choose to explore the local caf\u00e9 scene or take a brisk walk along Market Street amidst the hustle of a city busily waking up.",
