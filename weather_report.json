    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfurls under a radiant sky, kissed by the warmth of the sun, all while the gentle breeze beckons those yearning for a brief escape. With temperatures hovering around a pleasant 67 degrees, the air is clear and invigorating, offering a striking contrast to the typical fog that often cloaks the city. Today, the landscape stands unveiled, showcasing a vivid panorama devoid of the usual marine layer. The golden spires of the Bay glisten invitingly in the sunlight.\n\nAs evening creeps in, a subtle shift awaits; the clouds will slip in, occasional aspersions of gray against the tranquil blue. The gentle west-southwest winds, currently cradling the air, will continue to whip ever-so-softly through the streets, bringing a hint of the chill that whispers of nightfall. It\u2019s wise to don layers, perhaps a light sweater, to harmonize with the evening coolness that will settle around 56 degrees. \n\nThis time of day promises the simple pleasures of a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9 where warm drinks can cradle your hands. For those who wish to savor the transition towards night, an excursion to view the artwork of the city under the softening light will surely enchant.",
