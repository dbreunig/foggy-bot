    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the city enjoys a largely clear sky, ushering in a sense of calm as evening falls. With temperatures drifting down to a cool 46 degrees and rising slightly as the night deepens, the air carries a crispness that hints at the approaching dawn. A gentle northwest breeze wraps around city corners, whispering through the trees and offering a refreshing touch. \n\nAs Thursday unfolds, the sun will awaken the landscape, brightening the streets with golden rays and bringing temperatures close to 61 degrees by midday. The afternoon will see a slight reprieve as the warmth dips to about 59, a comfortable embrace for those wandering about. The absence of fog tonight suggests clear views that invite leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to one of the city's charming cafes, where the comforting aroma of fresh coffee provides a momentary pause from the urban bustle. As the day progresses, a light jacket and comfortable shoes will serve well for enjoying the outdoors, celebrating the pleasant weather while it lasts.",
