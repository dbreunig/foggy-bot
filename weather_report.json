    "weather_report": "As dawn stirs and the city awakens, a shroud of cloudiness envelops Downtown San Francisco, casting a gentle veil over its iconic skyline. The air is still, the breeze barely stirring as it whispers through the streets. With a chance of rain anticipated after early morning, the low temperature hovers around a cool 56 degrees, inviting residents to layer themselves thoughtfully. \n\nTuesday promises a similar narrative, the clouds remaining steadfast throughout the day, interspersed with occasional hints of brightness and a gentle patter of rain expected before evening settles in. The forecasted high of 63 degrees might not evoke a rush for summer attire; instead, a light jacket or a cozy sweater would be wise companions for a brisk walk by the Embarcadero or a leisurely afternoon at one of the local coffee shops tucked away in the Mission District. As the day unfolds, the fog may linger and dance along the edges of the Golden Gate, a soft reminder of the coastal city\u2019s persistent marine influence. \n\nWhile visibility may not be at its peak, the charm of the city doesn't wane; it invites you to slow down, perhaps to explore the art of conversation over a warm drink or to lose yourself in the pages of a good book in a nearby caf\u00e9. Embrace the misty, serene atmosphere, allowing the city's quieter moments to cradle your day.",
