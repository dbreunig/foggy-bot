    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle shroud of clouds envelops the city, hinting at the cooler air settling in. With a low temperature resting comfortably around 51 degrees, a delicate west wind whispers through the streets, offering a soft embrace rather than a biting chill. The softness of the clouds suggests a night of introspection, where the city\u2019s iconic landmarks fade into shadows, their outlines softened against the sky.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will unfurl itself with tranquil certainty, bathing the day in warmth as temperatures approach 62 degrees. The gentle breeze will accompany this sunlit canvas, with gusts only reaching up to 10 mph, creating an ideal atmosphere for leisurely pursuits. While the clouds may linger, they are set to depart, revealing the vibrant hues of a San Francisco day that invites exploration rather than confinement. It will be a splendid occasion to don layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a denim jacket\u2014perfect for the brisk morning that gives way to afternoon brightness. Whether it's a stroll through the historic streets, a savoring of artisan coffee at a local caf\u00e9, or simply basking in the sun\u2019s embrace at a nearby park, the day beckons with the promise of serendipitous simplicity.",
