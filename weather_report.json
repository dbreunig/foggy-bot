    "weather_report": "As the stillness of night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the city wears a veil of patchy drizzle amidst a cloud-swathed sky. The air is cool, flirting gently with a temperature around 56 degrees, inviting a light jacket or an extra layer. The winds whisper softly from the west-southwest, a mere breeze that stirs the humidity yet does little to disturb the tranquility. As dawn approaches, the promise of morning brings a continuation of this drizzle, hinting at a rather overcast start to the day. \n\nBy midmorning, skies will yield slightly\u2014allowing for a patchy sun to break through as the high creeps towards 63 degrees. As daylight lingers into the afternoon, temperatures will modestly decline to around 61, perhaps echoing the slight chill that often accompanies the retreating sun. The wind picking up to 15 mph with occasional gusts may rustle away some of the haze, revealing the city\u2019s silhouette against the horizon. It is a day that invites leisurely walks along the waterfront, a cozy breakfast at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, or even an afternoon spent reading at a quiet park. Dressed in layers, those who venture outside will be met by a refreshing breath of city air, mixed with a light touch of the sea. In this atmosphere, where fog sometimes hugs the coast, one might find comfort in embracing the calm\u2014a day well-suited for indulging in the everyday simplicities of life.",
