Presently, the warmth of the day is yielding to a gentle coolness, edging toward a comfortable evening that hints at 56 degrees. A soft breeze from the southwest carries the faint scent of the waterfront, making it a delightful backdrop for a leisurely stroll or perhaps a quiet moment on a bench overlooking the bay. \n\nIn these twilight hours, only the slightest chance of drizzle lurks, poised to visit the city while the world sleeps. Dressed in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater under a jacket\u2014would be wise as the temperatures dip. The day ahead promises moments of sunshine, enriched by the characteristic coastal winds that remind us of the ocean\u2019s embrace. It would be a fine occasion to explore local cafes or simply savor the sights of the bustling streets, as the city prepares to welcome the night in its unique, captivating charm.",
