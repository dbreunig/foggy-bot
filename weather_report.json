    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Downtown San Francisco, the sky remains shrouded in a soft veil of clouds, with the temperature resting comfortably around 62 degrees. A gentle southwest breeze whispers through the streets, adding a hint of freshness to the air. The forecast hints at rain later in the day, particularly after 11 a.m., accompanied by a subtle drop in temperatures. The atmosphere carries whispers of potential drizzle, with a modest 30% chance looming over the skyline. \n\nIn these early hours, one might see the city's iconic structures peeking through the mist, painted against a backdrop of muted grays as the marine layer hovers nearby. Clarity varies, with the Golden Gate Bridge occasionally obscured, inviting a sense of mystery. For the day ahead, layers are advisable; a light sweater or jacket paired with comfortable shoes will allow for leisurely explorations, whether visiting a cozy caf\u00e9 or strolling through vibrant neighborhoods. Consider taking in a local exhibition or perhaps browsing the quaint shops that line the streets, as the rhythmic pulse of the city invites a wanderlust that is only enhanced by the cool, gentle embrace of the fog.",
