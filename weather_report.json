    "weather_report": "In the serene stillness of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco lies beneath a partly cloudy sky, with the promise of a brighter day unfolding. As the day breaks, the temperatures will rise gently, settling around a comfortable 69 degrees in the afternoon. The west-southwest breeze adds a light touch, whispering through the streets and inviting casual strolls. Though the night air carries a hint of the cool marine layer, the fog has receded, allowing for a clear view of the city\u2019s iconic architecture illuminated in soft daylight.\n\nAs you contemplate your attire for the day, consider layering\u2014a simple t-shirt beneath a light jacket will serve you well against the coolness of dawn and the warmth expected as the sun ascends higher. The day calls for simple pleasures; a visit to one of the many nearby parks, perhaps grabbing a coffee from a local caf\u00e9, or meandering through the streets to admire both hidden gems and popular sights. Each breath of the crisp air reminds you to savor the moment, as the city awakens to a beautiful San Francisco day.",
