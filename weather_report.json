    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon sun casts a gentle glow across the landscape, illuminating the city's iconic structures with a soft warmth. Temperatures hover around a mild sixty-four degrees, promising to dip slightly as the day unfolds. The west wind stirs playfully, carrying with it a fresh tang from the bay, while the clouds begin to weave in like a soft blanket in anticipation of nightfall. Although the horizon reveals shades of blue, a hint of marine layer suggests that certain vistas may be veiled in a delicate fog, particularly closer to the ocean where the chill embraces the shoreline.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent, wrap yourself in layers fit for the changing weather. A light jacket will serve well against the brisk winds that accompany these late afternoons, especially if you find yourself near the waterfront where the breezes can bite a bit more sharply. This is a delightful moment to embrace the little pleasures of the day\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet sit in one of the city's charming parks, watching as the bustle of people fades into the evening. As dusk paints the sky with sepia tones, savoring a warm cup of coffee or tea becomes a perfect afterthought, allowing the day's warmth to linger just a little longer within.",
