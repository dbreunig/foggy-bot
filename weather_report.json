    "weather_report": "As the first light of dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the sky wears a slate of ambiguous gray, hinting at overnight clouds that linger like a soft whisper against the contours of the city. With the temperature hovering comfortably in the mid-fifties, a gentle breeze stirs, bringing with it the subtle scent of the ocean, a reminder of the nearby bay. Come midday, the forecast promises a transition into clearer skies, where the sun will assert itself with delightful warmth, nudging the high toward a pleasant sixty-nine. Here, the temperature will gradually ease into the afternoon's embrace, allowing for those wandering outdoors to enjoy the lingering sun without fear of oppressive heat.\n\nFor those contemplating venturing out, layers are the wise choice\u2014perhaps a light sweater or cardigan to combat the early chill, which can swiftly shift to a more moderate warmth as the day unfolds. Strolling through the vibrant streets or savoring a coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, one could witness the rhythm of the city awaken. There\u2019s no hurry; the activity will flow as naturally as the bay\u2019s gentle waves, an invitation to indulge in the little pleasures: perhaps a leisurely walk across the Embarcadero or an exploration of local galleries that capture the essence of this spirited metropolis. The charm of San Francisco lies in its layers, just like today\u2019s weather.",
