    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, there's an embrace of warm sunlight, casting its gentle glow as temperatures hover near the pleasant mid-70s. The city's iconic skyline remains visible against a backdrop of bright azure skies, with hints of wind weaving through the air, announcing the playful character of the afternoon. With the breeze coming from the west at a brisk pace, one may feel a welcome chill, especially along the waterfront. As evening approaches, a slight chance of drizzle lingers on the horizon, but for now, the day unfolds clear and inviting, allowing a view of the Golden Gate Bridge and beyond.\n\nFor those contemplating evening plans, a light jacket or sweater is advisable as temperatures dip to a comfortable 60 degrees. This doesn't detract from the enjoyment of a leisurely evening stroll along the Embarcadero, where one might indulge in a casual meal at an outdoor caf\u00e9, relishing the mild air. Alternatively, gatherings at home with friends, perhaps enjoying a movie night or a board game, suit the tranquil evening perfectly. The slight chance of drizzle adds an air of cozy intimacy to the night, making it an ideal time to unwind and relax.",
