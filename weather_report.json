    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the late afternoon sun bathes the city in a gentle golden hue, a fitting embrace for the vibrant streets below. Clarity reigns, with the high temperature reaching a comfortable 71, promising an evening that transitions to a cooler low around 60. A brisk west wind at 22 mph, carrying occasional gusts, weaves through the city's iconic hills, lending a lively edge to the day. \n\nAs twilight approaches, a light chance of drizzle looms, but for now, the horizon remains predominantly clear. The absence of fog creates a sense of openness, inviting leisurely strolls along the waterfront or a quiet retreat to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the salty breeze. Donning a light jacket would be wise, especially as the night cools, and should a sprinkle greet you come evening, an umbrella might also serve well as a faithful companion for the extraordinary urban experience that this magnificent city offers.",
