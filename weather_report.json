    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of early morning, Downtown San Francisco embraces an atmosphere that feels promising yet slightly laden with the whispers of the night. The sun's ascent is soon to bathe the city in gentle warmth, while the coastal haze still lingers, suggesting the marine layer is still present, particularly hugging the Golden Gate and the hills beyond. Visibility, though not obscured, carries that elusive quality characteristic of this time of year, imparting a soft glow to the skyline, as the city's iconic features stand in muted contrast against the pale dawn.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect temperatures to hover pleasantly, ideal for light layers\u2014perhaps a cozy cardigan to ward off the morning chill, and comfortable trousers to navigate the casual rhythm of city life. A stroll along the waterfront would be delightful, where the interplay of sunlight and shifting clouds can coax the spirit to life, or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warming cup of coffee while basking in the rich aromas that fill the air. While there\u2019s a slight chance of rain later in the night, now is the perfect time to savor the unclouded moments, where each step feels woven with the energy that only a fresh San Francisco day can offer.",
