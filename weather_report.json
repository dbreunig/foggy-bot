    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the sky is gently veiled in clouds, allowing for the soft glow of distant lights to dance across the landscape. With a cool breeze swirling in from the west southwest, temperatures dip to a comfortable 52 degrees, setting the stage for a peaceful night. The air feels fresh, accented by the invigorating scent of the sea, as gusts gently rustle through the city streets, reminding us of the ever-present embrace of the coastal winds.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Sunday, expect the sun to cut through earlier cloudiness, beckoning a mostly sunny day with a high near 62. While the warmth may feel inviting, particularly in the early hours, the humidity from the ocean lingers, creating a slight chill that lingers in the shade of the buildings. Dress in layers to navigate the day\u2019s transitions; a light jacket or sweater will serve you well during those moments when the marine layer wavers between fog and clarity. Considering the pleasant, if slightly brisk, conditions, it\u2019s a fine time for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a caf\u00e9 for a warm drink. Occupying a novel nook with a good book could lead to a delightfully unhurried morning, perfect for savoring the nascent beauty of another day in this vibrant city.",
