    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a bright canopy, where mostly clear skies lend a gentle warmth to the lingering light. As the sun inches toward the horizon, the temperature hovers around 72, offering a comfortable embrace for those strolling the city streets. A brisk west-southwest wind, dancing at 18 mph with occasional gusts, adds a refreshing edge, stirring the scents of the bay. The atmosphere is punctuated by the faint brush of clouds, a soft reminder of the night's embrace yet to come.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the skies will turn partly cloudy, allowing a serene transition into evening. The coolness of the night is expected to settle in around 57 degrees, making a light jacket or sweater a wise choice. The coastal marine layer may swirl near the bridge, but it likely won\u2019t impose on the clarity of the day\u2014a brief cherishing of daylight before shadows stretch across the city. This idyllic weather beckons a gentle wander through parks, perhaps savoring an evening coffee al fresco or indulging in a quiet moment by the waterfront, where conversations drift easily with the breeze. Such simple pleasures transform a day into a lasting memory, embodying the charm of this vibrant city.",
