    "weather_report": "San Francisco is basking in a gentle embrace of sunshine this afternoon, with the air dancing pleasantly around 70 degrees. As the day unfolds, expect a subtle descent to about 64, the cool breath of a west-southwest wind weaving through the streets at a leisurely 9 mph. It's a generous invitation to step outside, where the clear blue sky casts a serene light over the iconic skyline, with the Golden Gate Bridge piercing through the horizon like a whisper of dreams on a canvas. \n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will wrap themselves in a soft cloak of clouds, dipping to a cozy 52. While the fog may linger at the edges, it won't wholly veil the city's charm, leaving plenty of room for exploration. This is a day for uncomplicated enjoyments: perhaps a stroll along the waterfront, where the familiar symbols of the city shimmer in the sunlight, or a leisurely coffee at an outdoor cafe, where the everyday fabric of life weaves stories to the rhythm of gentle conversation. As you step out, consider layering lightly, as the warmth of the day may fade into a cool evening, ensuring you remain comfortably attuned to the city's ever-changing moods.",
