With a cool breeze whispering through the streets, the clarity of the night is marked by an absence of fog, allowing the iconic skyline to emerge with a crisp precision. Tonight's low temperature of around 47 degrees invites the city's dwellers to wrap themselves in layers\u2014perhaps a soft sweater over a light shirt, paired with comfortable jeans, perfect for an evening stroll or a quiet cafe rendezvous. \n\nOn Friday, the forecast paints a sunny portrait with a high approaching 65, though a subtle afternoon descent to around 63 offers a reminder of the capricious nature of coastal weather. Florid rays of sunshine beckon for outdoor activities\u2014an artful wander through Golden Gate Park, or perhaps a leisurely brunch at one of the many sun-kissed terraces downtown. With light north winds to stoke your spirit and minimal chance of the marine layer, the day promises a ballet of warmth and light, perfect for relishing in the vibrant life of the city.",
