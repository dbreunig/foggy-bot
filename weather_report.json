Today, the embodies a photograph of summer serenity, unmarred by fog, allowing views of the Golden Gate Bridge to stretch across the horizon, unclouded and vibrant against the blue canvas above.\n\nAs evening approaches, the scene remains bright, with the temperature dipping to a soothing 54 degrees.
