    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning begins with a whisper of drizzle lingering in the air, soon to be replaced by a gentle warmth as the sun emerges to cast its glow over the city. Skies clear, revealing a mostly sunny expanse as the day unfolds with a high around 66 degrees, gradually settling around a comfortable 64 in the afternoon. Moderate winds sweep through, offering a refreshing breeze that invigorates the soul while serving as a reminder of the bay\u2019s ever-present maritime charm. As the evening approaches, the clarity deepens, promising a peaceful night with temperatures settling around 58 degrees.\n\nWith the forecast in mind, it beckons you to embrace the day outside. A light jacket, perhaps a cozy cardigan, would suit the temperate climate, while closed-toe shoes will keep you comfortable against the cool wind. Consider an idyllic stroll along the Embarcadero, or perhaps exploring the hidden gems of Golden Gate Park, where the greenery thrives under the sun's embrace. It\u2019s a day for thoughtful wanderings through the city\u2019s heart, a canvas painted with the vibrancy of its architecture and the soft rustle of nature.",
