    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the bustling city begins to reflect an inviting hush. The night sky is mostly clear, a gentle expanse punctuated by a few distant stars. With temperatures hovering around the mid-fifties, one can feel the cool embrace of a westerly breeze, lively enough to stir the trees and ruffle the edges of jackets. For those fortunate enough to wander outside, a light layer will serve well; perhaps a cozy cardigan or a soft jacket will keep the evening chill at bay.\n\nLooking to tomorrow, the promise of sunshine greets the day, hinting at a high near sixty-four. The sun will cast its warm glow, but be prepared for temperatures that may dip slightly in the afternoon. A brisk wind, playful and spirited, will dance along the streets, making it an ideal day for a stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely bike ride through Golden Gate Park. The beauty of tomorrow lies not just in the clear skies but also in the invigorating air, making it a perfect moment to savor a coffee from a local caf\u00e9 while basking in the sun\u2019s gentle warmth.",
