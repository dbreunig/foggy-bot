    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth washes over the city, bathing it in sunshine and inviting moments of leisure. The west southwest wind carries a refreshing coolness, hinting at the Pacific\u2019s embrace. The skyline stands clear and unobstructed, while the Golden Gate Bridge remains a majestic silhouette against a backdrop of deep blue. However, as the sun begins its descent, clouds will gather, subtly altering the tapestry above; a slight chance of drizzle emerges, marking the transition to a more contemplative evening.\n\nWith temperatures hovering around a mild 64 degrees and a gentle breeze in the air, it\u2019s time to don lightweight layers\u2014a cozy sweater over a light shirt should suffice. As dusk approaches, consider a stroll through the quieter streets, perhaps culminating in a cup of warm tea as the city begins to shimmer in the early night. The marine layer is poised to linger close by, ready to adorn the landscape in a soft cloak of mist should the evening call for it.",
