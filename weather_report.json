    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco greets you this afternoon with a curious blend of sun and the lingering essence of the ocean\u2019s touch. While the forecast hints at a minor chance of rain before 4 p.m., the prevailing atmosphere is mostly sunny, inviting for those looking to savor the outdoors. The breeze from the west-southwest, brisk and occasionally gusty, adds a hint of excitement to the day, stirring the leaves in a gentle dance. However, don\u2019t let the warmth of 67 degrees deceive you; a hefty layer of coastal marine influence may bring moments of chill along the water's edge.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the sky may don a partly cloudy veil, wrapping the evening in a soft embrace with temperatures easing down to around 57. It would be wise to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a casual jacket to guard against the cool evening air. With such conditions, a stroll through the vibrant streets may be particularly enjoyable; consider exploring the art-filled alleys or winding your way to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm beverage. The San Francisco light sets an inviting stage, reminiscent of moments where the city's character reveals itself in unexpected ways.",
