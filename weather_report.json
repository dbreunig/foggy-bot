    "weather_report": "As the night unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, an expectant hush hangs in the air. The weather is a whisper of what tomorrow might hold, with a slight chance of rain skirting the edges of the evening, perhaps even before the clock strikes one. Currently, the skies drape themselves in a mostly cloudy shawl, cloaking the city in shades of grey as the temperature settles around a cool 50 degrees. A gentle westerly breeze meanders through the streets, barely a breath at around three miles per hour.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Sunday, the clouds will still linger, casting a muted light over the day, with temperatures nudging up to the low 60s. One cannot help but sense the marine layer's embrace, layered low on the hills and softening the contours of the landscape. The atmosphere is painted in comforting tones, inviting an uneventful stroll through the quieter avenues or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh brews can warm both hands and spirit. Chic layers will serve well in this fluid weather, perhaps a light jacket over a comfortable sweater, perfect for enjoying the nuanced beauty that this slightly gloomy yet peaceful day offers.",
