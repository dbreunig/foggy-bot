    "weather_report": "As the sun sets over Downtown San Francisco, the city settles into a graceful stillness marked by clear skies and a gentle breeze. The current temperature hovers comfortably around fifty-two degrees, offering a sense of tranquility that bathes the streets in a soft glow. With winds from the west-southwest at a steady twelve miles per hour, one can almost hear the whispers of the breezes playing through the trees. Tomorrow promises a full embrace of the sun, inviting temperatures to reach a delightful sixty-four degrees before settling back into the afternoon's cooler embrace around sixty-two. \n\nThe clarity of the evening hints at the absence of fog, though the tendrils of any marine layer may linger beyond the horizon, watching quietly as moonlight dances on the water. For solace seekers and strollers, the weather is an invitation to wander through the quieter streets, perhaps enjoying a leisurely meal at an outdoor caf\u00e9 or savoring the subtle charm of a walk through the city's parks. Dressing in light layers will suffice\u2014enough to keep warm against the evening chill but light enough to welcome the day's warmth tomorrow.",
