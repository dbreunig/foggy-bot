    "weather_report": "As the sun drifts lower in the sky over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere takes on a cool, muted tone, hinting at the patchy drizzle forecasted to grace the city tonight. A marine layer cloaks the skyline, softening the edges of the iconic structures against a pastel backdrop of gray clouds. With temperatures lounging around a mild 56 degrees, a gentle wind whispers through the streets, brushing past at 8 to 14 mph, occasionally picking up strength to remind all of its presence. The percentage of drizzle is low, yet the air holds that familiar hint of moisture, offering a cozy prevalence of clouds overhead.\n\nLooking toward tomorrow, the drizzle will linger lightly in the morning, but eventually give way to a partly sunny day, with warmth edging closer to 62. Body heat may be best complemented by light layers; a light jacket or cardigan will harmonize with those who prefer comfort as they stroll along the waterfront or sip a warm drink in a quiet caf\u00e9. It\u2019s a lovely day to wander through the city\u2019s hidden nooks, perhaps indulging in a leisurely read at a bustling library or visiting one of the art galleries that often remain somewhat less frequented on Saturdays. Whether finding solace in casual explorations or quietly reflecting in a sunny corner, the day's conditions beckon a gentle embrace of the unfolding weekend.",
