    "weather_report": "This afternoon, the beauty of Downtown San Francisco reveals itself under a sunny sky, painting the city with golden hues when viewed from the heights of Sutro Tower. A gentle warmth envelopes the air\u2014mild, yet kissed by a notable westerly breeze, offering just the right touch to temper the warmth. Clouds, though mostly absent, yield to occasional wisps that flutter like soft whispers above. The marine layer, typical of this locale, might suggest a hint of fog, lingering like an elusive dream just beyond the Golden Gate, but it finds no home in the immediate cityscape.\n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will remain predominantly clear, inviting a tranquil transition into the night. With temperatures sliding down to a comfortable coolness, it becomes an evening to enjoy the simple pleasures. Here, cozy layers worn over a light shirt will keep the chill at bay, allowing for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or casual gatherings at outdoor cafes. Embrace the evening, whether spending time enjoying the company of friends or simply wandering the cobblestone streets, soaking in the ethereal charm of the city as it begins to sparkle under the soft glow of twilight.",
