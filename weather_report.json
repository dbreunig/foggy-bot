The streets will soon shimmer under this balmy sky, illuminated by temperatures gently cascading from a high near 74, settling at a comfortable 72 as the day progresses. Embraced by clarity, the horizon stretches without the burden of fog\u2014an inviting sight that hints at strolls among the iconic landmarks or the quietude of a nearby caf\u00e9 terrace. \n\nAs twilight approaches, the sky will don a more introspective demeanor, revealing soft, drifting clouds while the temperature dips to a modest 57. The same brisk winds will persist, carrying with them the saltiness of the bay, lending a unique vibrancy to the evening air. It\u2019s a time when light sweaters or light jackets become indispensable companions, allowing you to savor an idyllic sunset, perhaps while exploring the bustling urban landscape by foot or sharing a moment in one of the city\u2019s enchanting parks.
