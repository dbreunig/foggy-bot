    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the evening sky drapes itself in a veiled curtain of clouds, whispering a gentle reminder of the city's enchanting charm. With a low of about 54 degrees, the air carries a chill, accentuated by a westerly breeze that stirs softly at 7 to 10 mph. The subtle hum of the city winds down as urban lights twinkle into existence, mingling with the shadows of the hills.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Monday, the promise of a mostly sunny day invites you to step outside, where temperatures will creep toward 64 degrees before settling a touch cooler in the afternoon. The west southwest winds increase to a light, playful zephyr, lifting enthusiasm and spirits alike. Despite the clarity of the day, shadows might linger as the marine layer plays its familiar game, creeping in and out, particularly near the coastline. For your outing, consider layering lightly; a simple long-sleeved shirt paired with a light jacket will serve you well against the cool gusts. Perhaps take a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the world unfolds, or visit a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a warming drink as the sun bathes the city in its golden embrace. Your San Francisco adventure awaits, framed by a backdrop of fog and sunlight, a canvas that remains ever-shifting yet perpetually beautiful.",
