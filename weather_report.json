    "weather_report": "As dawn gently breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a partial cloud cover, ushering in a cool comfort that lingers in the air. The temperature settles around 51 degrees, accompanied by a brisk west wind whispering through the streets at 18 mph, with occasional stronger gusts reminding passersby of the dynamic nature of coastal weather. While visibility remains clear enough to appreciate the silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge, the typical marine layer holds its breath just beyond, keeping its misty shroud in reserve.\n\nToday promises a transformation, as the sun ascends higher, revealing a cheerful brightness that will bathe the city in warmth, with temperatures expected to reach a pleasant 62 degrees. Although the winds pick up throughout the day, brushing by at 17 to 25 mph, the sun\u2019s embrace should render a sense of uplift, inviting locals and visitors alike to explore. Layers would be wise; a light jacket or sweater would serve well against the nippy breeze of the morning, while a short-sleeved top could refresh in the afternoon's embrace. This promising weather unfolds perfectly for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, coffee in hand, or a quiet afternoon spent in the verdant embrace of Golden Gate Park, where the sounds of lush life invite a momentary escape.",
