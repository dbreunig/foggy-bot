    "weather_report": "In the quiet embrace of the night, Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in a tranquil stillness, the remnants of a city poised for the dawn. As the hours draw closer to daylight, the air is crisp, marked by a gentle coolness that hovers around fifty degrees. The breeze whispers softly, a north-northeast wind that nudges the trees in a subtle dance. Tonight, the sky is mostly clear, allowing the stars to peek shyly through the vastness, while the outlines of the Golden Gate and the familiar urban silhouettes rest just beyond the horizon, shadowed yet majestic.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect a brilliant brush of sunshine to bathe the city by morning, promising a high near sixty-seven degrees. The warmth of the sun will gradually melt away its predecessor's chill, transforming the landscape into a vibrant tapestry of light and shadow. The serenity of the early hours will give way to what feels like the tender caress of a spring day\u2014not too obtrusive, but rather inviting. While the heavens are likely to remain free of fog, the transition to afternoon may see a gentle slide in temperatures, beckoning a slight coolness. For those venturing outdoors, a light jacket should suffice in the morning, perhaps layered over a comfortable tee. Time spent strolling through the colorful streets or sipping coffee at a sun-drenched caf\u00e9 in the afternoon will be the perfect homage to such a lively day. As dusk approaches, a warm cardigan will further wrap you in contentment, inviting quiet reflection as day surrenders to night.",
