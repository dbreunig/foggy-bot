Dressing in layers is advisable to embrace the coolness of the evening, when temperatures will settle around a comfortable 50 degrees under a blanket of stars and serenity. Whether you choose to wander through the bustling streets or find a quiet nook to reflect, today offers the perfect backdrop for appreciating the charm of this coastal city.",
