Tonight, the ambiance carries with it a gentle promise of drizzle, though it lingers on the periphery, an unobtrusive reminder of the coastal charm that shrouds the city in its embrace. The temperature hovers in the comfortable realm of the upper fifties, while the west-southwest wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it a refreshing crispness, an invitation to enjoy the cool air while wrapped in a light jacket. \n\nAs dawn breaks on Friday, expect a slight chance of drizzle before the sun peeks through the clouds, transforming the morning into a mostly sunny display. With highs nearing sixty-seven degrees and the warmth of the afternoon sun coaxing out the brightness, it promises to be a pleasant day, albeit with a gentle cooling trend as the hours unfold. The marine layer may still linger in the shadows, softening the edges of the landscape, inviting exploration of the winding streets or the tranquility of a local caf\u00e9 where one can sip a warm brew while watching the world gently awaken. With such weather, a casual attire suffices\u2014a light sweater or a comfortable jacket is all one needs to harmonize with the cool, inviting air. Perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a hidden gallery might be on the agenda, paths illuminated by both sunshine and soft clouds.",
