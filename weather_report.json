    "weather_report": "In the early hours of a crisp San Francisco night, the breeze carries whispers of a day past\u2014one marked by a gentle sun lighting the city\u2019s vibrant hues. As the afternoon wanes, the sky transitions from a radiant blue to a blanket of delicate clarity, punctuated by the occasional flutter of clouds. The wind, a steadfast companion, rustles through the streets, invigorating the senses with its cool embrace. Tonight promises a subtle shift, however, with whispers of drizzle teasing the edges of a mostly clear sky, though the air hangs heavy with a hint of moisture, a reminder of the looming marine layer that often dances along the coast.\n\nAs you step out, layered clothing becomes your ally\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a t-shirt, as the temperatures glide through the evening\u2019s mild embrace. The atmosphere, while primarily inviting, bears the promise of an enchanting night; a perfect backdrop for a leisurely stroll through the illuminated streets or a serene gathering at an outdoor caf\u00e9. Let the cool air envelop you, guiding you to explore the intricacies of this enchanting city or to pause and savor a warm beverage under the flickering glow of lanterns. For those inclined to revel in simple pleasures, consider a walk along the Embarcadero, where the rhythmic waves serenade the shore and the skyline stands tall, embracing the fading sunlight's glow.",
