    "weather_report": "As the morning light gently spills over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a blanket of clarity, the golden rays piercing through crisp, vibrant skies. Today, you\u2019ll find the air still, with a hint of warmth that will coax the mercury to a high near 60, dropping to a refreshing 57 as the afternoon drifts on. The soft southwest breeze caresses the landscape, murmuring secrets of the ocean just beyond the bay. While the morning starts bright, lingering wisps of fog dance near the edges of the Golden Gate, hinting at the marine layer that often graces the coast before retreating as the sun climbs higher.\n\nDressing in layers is a wise choice, as the day begins with a cool embrace that gradually gives way to a comfortable warmth. A light jacket or sweater may serve you well, especially as the evening approaches and temperatures dip to 46. The promise of a mostly clear night encourages a stroll through the local parks or perhaps an intimate gathering at a quaint caf\u00e9\u2014there's something special about sharing laughter and stories as the stars blink awake above. Whether you venture to enjoy the cityscape or sip a warm beverage while watching the world go by, today offers a splendid canvas of moderate beauty, inviting you to step outside and savor the serene charm of San Francisco.",
