    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun casts its golden light over Downtown San Francisco, the city finds itself blissfully removed from the fog that so often lingers by the bay. A pleasant warmth wraps around the streets, the temperature gently nudging toward the mid-sixties. The bright, blue canvas above is a comforting reminder of summer days, though a light west-southwest breeze dances in and out, playfully rustling leaves and sending whispers through the avenues. By late afternoon, expect the warmth to gradually retreat, ushering in a mild evening that settles around fifty-five degrees, prompting a light jacket or a cozy sweater to accompany your evening stroll.\n\nUnder these clear skies, there\u2019s an invitation to explore. Perhaps a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero to take in the gentle lapping of the tides against the docks, or a quiet moment spent in one of the city\u2019s countless parks, where a picnic blanket unfurls against the verdant grass. For those inclined to sip something warm, the many cafes dotting the streets offer refuge, perfect for unwinding and soaking in the restorative buzz of urban life. Today\u2019s weather is simply delightful, inviting you to step outside and savor the soft embrace of a San Francisco summer afternoon and evening.",
