The gentle west-southwest breeze whispers through the streets, carrying with it the promise of transitional weather. As night deepens, the city\u2019s sporadic lights glimmer like stars at sea, yet the horizon suggests a lingering satin of fog, mysteriously cloaking the iconic Golden Gate. \n\nTomorrow beckons brighter, with the sun stretching its golden rays across the sky, teasing the day with mostly clear conditions. Expect highs approaching the comfortable mid-60s as the warmth gradually replaces the coolness of the night. Clarity will sweep in, illuminating the rich architecture and rugged landscapes that make this city so beloved. Dressing in layers will serve you well, beginning with a light jacket to ward off the evening chill, transforming to simpler attire as the sun ascends. This is a day woven for quiet pleasures\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll along Market Street, caught in the rhythm of downtown life, or the simple joy of a coffee shared at a corner caf\u00e9, where you might observe the city waking up from its slumber.",
