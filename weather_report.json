    "weather_report": "As the night whispers its final farewells, Downtown San Francisco finds itself cloaked in a gentle veil of partly cloudy vitality. The air is crisp, holding a subtle promise of refreshment as the temperature grazes the low fifties. A soft breeze from the southwest stirs the trees, inviting quiet contemplation and the mellow hum of the city\u2019s pulse beneath the twilight sky.\n\nAwakening into Tuesday, the sun will rise in earnest, casting a warm glow across the iconic skyline while the clouds bid adieu. Expect a day where the high brushes the mid-sixties, though a slight coolness may descend as the afternoon tiptoes toward evening. While fog may dance along the edges of the bay, hinting at a more mysterious marine layer, the essence of the day will be predominantly clear, encouraging a sense of lightness and serenity. Dressing in layers offers an ideal strategy; a light sweater or jacket makes for a perfect companion as the sun climbs and the breeze turns playful. With the comforting warmth hanging in the air, stroll along the waterfront, sip coffee at a local caf\u00e9, or simply reconnect with the rhythm of the city through a leisurely walk, allowing the beauty of a fresh new day to wash over you.",
