Currently, the warmth of the sun feels comfortable against a gentle suggestion of briskness in the air, especially as one feels the breath of the southwest winds weaving through the streets. The high is poised to settle near 71, with temperatures easing into the comfort of the upper 60s as the afternoon unfolds. There\u2019s a certain vibrancy in the atmosphere, hinting at clarity, while the gentle sway of the wind carries whispers of distant waters.\n\nThis serene mid-morning suggests that dressing in layers will be wise\u2014perhaps a light long-sleeve paired with comfortable jeans or trousers, allowing for ease as you move through the city. A light jacket may prove pleasant against the evening's moderate coolness. As the day stretches on, you might find joy in a leisurely stroll by the Embarcadero, soaking up views of the bay and greeting the soft waves. Alternatively, a visit to one of the local coffee shops for a warm beverage, enjoyed alfresco, could be a perfect way to embrace the beautiful day, listening to the inherent hum of the vibrant city around you.",
