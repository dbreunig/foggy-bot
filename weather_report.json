    "weather_report": "The morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco under a canopy of ominous clouds, hinting at the unsettled weather ahead. As showers and thunderstorms are expected to sweep through before the afternoon, a brisk wind dances through the streets, rustling leaves and whispering tales of the coast. The air carries a chill, reinforcing the need for layered clothing\u2014a cozy sweater or light jacket is advisable, paired with sturdy shoes to navigate the damp sidewalks. The high temperature will barely graze the 56-degree mark, adding to the cool, unsettled atmosphere.\n\nAs the day progresses, the persistent clouds will likely remain, with rain tapering off but not entirely disappearing, leaving a 60% chance of light showers lingering in the late afternoon. Those in search of clearer skies may find their hopes dashed, as the city seems shrouded in a soft, gray veil with pockets of fog lingering near the headlands. Evening brings a potential respite, with mostly clear skies emerging and temperatures dipping into the mid-40s, allowing for a peaceful stroll along paths that shimmer with recent rain, perhaps toward a hidden caf\u00e9 where the warmth of a hot drink provides comfort against the cool backdrop of an awakening city.",
