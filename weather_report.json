    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the weather presents a serene yet dynamic blend of sun and clouds, with a gentle warmth that contrasts against the ever-cooling breeze. As the sun bathes the city in a bright glow, temperatures are gracefully drifting from a peak of 66 degrees towards a more tempered 61 by day\u2019s end. The west-southwest wind whispers through the streets, a comforting reminder of the ocean\u2019s proximity. \n\nTonight brings a soft transition into a mostly cloudy evening, where the temperature hovers around a mild 51 degrees, while the southwest breeze continues to caress the air. For those venturing out, a light jacket layered over casual attire will offer just the right amount of comfort against the cooling night. Considering the pleasant clarity and gentle warmth of the day, a stroll along the waterfront might be invigorating, or one might find refuge in a local caf\u00e9, enjoying a quiet moment with a good book. While visibility may be altered by the presence of a light marine layer, the allure of the Golden Gate and urban skyline remains ever captivating, inviting you to savor the city\u2019s charm in all its forms.",
