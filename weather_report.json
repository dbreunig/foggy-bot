    "weather_report": "As night wraps the city in a gentle embrace, Downtown San Francisco stands under a cloak of mostly cloudy skies, with temperatures settling around a mild 51 degrees. A soft breeze whispers through the streets, carrying with it the familiar scent of fresh bay air and hints of the ocean\u2019s salt. It\u2019s a calm evening, one that invites reflection or perhaps a quiet stroll along the waterfront, where the horizon blurs at the edge of darkness and city lights twinkle like distant stars.\n\nTomorrow's forecast promises a brightening of spirits as the sun breaks through the clouds, bringing warmth to the day. Expect a high near 61, dipping slightly to 58 in the afternoon, with gentle winds from the southwest. Those venturing outdoors will need light layers, perhaps a sweater or a light jacket for the lingering chill, especially if you find yourself near the water, where the marine layer may still clings to the shores, creating fleeting moments of fog that kiss the city\u2019s edges. It\u2019s an excellent day for an afternoon coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, where you can savor a warm drink while people-watching, or perhaps an exploratory walk through one of the city\u2019s many charming neighborhoods, each with its own unique character and vibrancy.",
