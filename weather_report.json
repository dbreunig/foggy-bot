Tonight's mostly cloudy skies obscure the moonlight, creating a soft blanket over the city, interrupted only by a slight chance of drizzle that may grace the streets past 11 pm. The winds whisper through the alleyways, maintaining their playful demeanor with gusts reaching up to 29 mph. \n\nDaylight tomorrow promises to unveil a sunlit canvas graced with clarity, though a shy high of 63 will eventually yield to a drop, bringing the temperature down as the afternoon unfolds. With the wind continuing its brisk performance, a careful choice of attire is in order\u2014layers will be your ally, perhaps a light jacket to fend off the evening chill and a comfortable shirt for the warmth of midday. Should the weather permit, a stroll along the Embarcadero could refresh your spirit, where the echoes of the city's vibrant life intertwine with the gentle lapping of bay waters, soothing the soul in the essence of the San Francisco night.",
