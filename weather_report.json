The pleasant warmth beckons you to venture outdoors; perhaps a leisurely bike ride along the Embarcadero or a visit to one of the local parks, where the clarity of the day reveals the city's iconic skyline. As the sun climbs higher, the gentle westerlies will continue to swirl, whispering tales of the bay and inviting you to embrace the beautiful simplicity of a day under its soothing light. With temperatures that are comfortably moderate, layering will ensure your ease whether you find yourself basking in the sun or enjoying a delightful afternoon ride through the tree-lined streets.",
