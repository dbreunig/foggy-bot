    "weather_report": "As twilight cloaks Downtown San Francisco in a gentle hush, the current atmosphere feels tranquil, hinting at the cool embrace of the night that beckons ahead. The city is mostly clear, offering a calm vista, with shadows softly settling over landmarks that have long stood as sentinels against time. However, warmth is fleeting, as temperatures will soon dip to a crisp 44 degrees. A mild southwest breeze whispers through the streets, adding a layer of coolness, perfect for a light jacket or perhaps a cozy sweater if one ventures out.\n\nTomorrow, the skies will shift as rain makes its entrance after the late afternoon. Expect the day to dance between sun and clouds, culminating in a likely chance of light rain after 5 PM. For the day ahead\u2014where a high near 57 is anticipated\u2014the joy of partaking in a leisurely afternoon stroll could be an exquisite option, particularly in the early hours when the sun still contributes its warmth. One might pause at a beloved caf\u00e9, savouring a cup of coffee while watching the world meander by, before the clouds roll in to usher in the evening's first drops. For now, the city lingers in a moment of quiet beauty, poised in the balance before tomorrow's anticipated changes.",
