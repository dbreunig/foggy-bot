    "weather_report": "The morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, embracing an inviting warmth bathed in golden rays. The sun rises over the city, casting a vibrant glow that perks up the senses. Today promises a generous dose of sunshine, with temperatures dancing around a comfortable high near seventy, gently slipping to a cooler sixty-eight by afternoon. A pleasing west-southwest breeze moves through the streets, creating a delightful interplay between warmth and the soft caress of air that hints at the bay.\n\nWhile the horizon is clear, there are whispers of marine layers retreating to the outskirts, allowing the city\u2019s skyline to stand proud and unencumbered. Tonight will usher in a serene stillness, punctuated by partly cloudy skies. A lighter jacket will serve well as the temperature dips to the mid-fifties, accompanied by breezy gusts nudging the evening's tranquility. The day beckons urban explorers; wandering through local parks or indulging in the myriad cafes for leisurely brunches feels particularly apt, especially with the warm tones and gentle wind drafting a perfect backdrop for conversation and reflection.",
