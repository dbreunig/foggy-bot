    "weather_report": "As dawn gives way to day, Downtown San Francisco reveals a landscape bathed in the gentle light of a mostly sunny morning. The air is crisp, with temperatures creeping up to a comfortable 58, though those venturing outdoors will feel the coolness gradually descend to 56. A light breeze from the west adds a refreshing touch, whispering through streets as the city awakens. \n\nHowever, the tranquility of the day will soon yield to the approaching rain. By nightfall, clouds will blanket the sky, and showers are anticipated to begin shortly after 11 PM, possibly heralded by the scent of wet earth that hangs sweetly in the air. Dress in layers, perhaps a cozy sweater or light jacket to fend off the coolness, especially as evening approaches. The expectation of rain invites a bit of indoor delight; visiting a local caf\u00e9 could be the perfect antidote to any autumnal chill, enjoying a warm drink while watching the city transition under the encroaching clouds. With a high chance of precipitation later, it might also be wise to keep an umbrella handy, just in case a delicate drizzle seeks to accompany you on your evening stroll.",
