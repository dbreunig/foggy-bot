    "weather_report": "As the sun ascends in the clear embrace of Memorial Day, Downtown San Francisco welcomes a day punctuated by the soft caress of a gentle west wind. The air has an invigorating crispness, with temperatures expected to hover around a comfortable 62 degrees. Despite the sunshine brightening the cityscape, a subtle marine layer lingers on the horizon, teasing the edges of the day with whispers of fog. One might catch a glimpse of it rolling delicately over the Golden Gate, transforming the iconic landmark into a ghostly silhouette, a balm against the brightness.\n\nAs evening approaches, the warmth will ease into a cooler embrace, dropping to around 50 degrees, beckoning residents to prepare for a pleasantly cool night ahead. For those venturing outside, a light jacket or sweater will provide just enough comfort against the gentle breeze. This mild weather invites you to indulge in a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping at a favorite caf\u00e9 to relish a warm drink while watching the sun dip below the bay, scattering shades of orange and pink across the canvas of the sky. Today is a reminder of San Francisco's nuanced beauty, where the sunlight is coupled harmoniously with the ever-present allure of the fog.",
