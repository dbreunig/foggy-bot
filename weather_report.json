    "weather_report": "In the brisk embrace of a San Francisco afternoon, the city gleams beneath a brilliant sun, the skies unblemished and clear, as though an artist has brushed away all clouds. The temperature may nestle comfortably around sixty-one degrees, yet a cool west wind whips through the streets, teasing jackets and hair alike. Despite the promise of warmth, expect a gentle descent in temperature as the afternoon meanders towards evening, with the air transforming into a canvas of subtle whispers of chill.\n\nAs the sun dips later into the horizon, the night will drape itself in partly cloudy skies, a soft blanket laced with a chill around fifty-two degrees. A light breeze persists, its playful gusts carrying whispers of maritime air. Dressed in layers\u2014a light sweater or jacket against the evening chill\u2014would be wise as you traverse the city\u2019s charming, twisting streets. With a reassuring clarity to the day, consider taking a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the gentle lapping of waves can accompany your thoughts, or perhaps indulge in the warmth of a cozy caf\u00e9, letting the day fade softly into night, rich with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the fresh ocean air.",
