    "weather_report": "A muted morning envelops Downtown San Francisco, where the atmosphere feels thick with the promise of rain. The day begins under a drape of clouds, casting a grayish hue across the skyline, hinting at the day\u2019s anticipated downpour. The city seems to breathe in the cool, moist air, and as the winds swirl from the west southwest, they carry with them the echo of impending rain. Visibility is limited, further amplified by a dense marine layer, veiling landmarks just beyond the immediate view\u2014especially the Golden Gate, which may appear faint in this obscured light.\n\nAs the day unfolds, one might find solace in the comforts of a warm scarf and a water-resistant jacket, for the forecast promises a persistent drizzle with gusts whipping between 18 to 26 mph. Such weather invites an indoor reprieve\u2014perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 nestled in the heart of the city, where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with the sound of rain against the windows. Alternatively, grabbing a good book and retreating to a quiet corner of home may well be the most delightful way to embrace the ambiance of a rainy day. By evening, as the rain dissipates, the coolness will linger, and the chance of a star-studded sky may emerge, but for now, the day is set against a tapestry of gray and the soothing rhythm of raindrops.",
