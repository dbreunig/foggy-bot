    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon brings a refreshing brightness, casting a warm glow across the iconic landscapes. With temperatures hovering near a comfortable 64 degrees, the city basks in the sunshine, gently stirred by a westward breeze. The soft rustle of the leaves and the distant sounds of the bustling city add to the ambience of a day that feels both spectacular and serene. As evening approaches, the prediction of mostly clear skies envelops the area, promising a gentle transition into night with temperatures settling around 54 degrees. A light southwest wind whispers through the streets, with the occasional gust reminding us of the lively nature of the San Francisco air.\n\nAs for the presence of fog, the horizon remains clear, with the marine layer securely tucked away, allowing the city\u2019s skyline to shine. For those contemplating an evening outing, a light sweater or jacket would be wise, both for comfort and to embrace the coolness as the sun sets behind the hills. One might savor the evening by taking a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps stopping for an early dinner in one of the cozy restaurants dotting the Embarcadero, where the views of the bay and city lights intertwine beautifully. This harmony of weather and atmosphere makes for a splendid backdrop, inviting both locals and visitors alike to revel in the essence of San Francisco.",
