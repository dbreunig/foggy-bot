    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this night, Downtown San Francisco drapes itself in a cloak of moisture and muted tones, with only a whisper of drizzle murmuring through the air. As the low clouds slide gracefully over the horizon, a mild chill settles around 57 degrees, accented by a west-southwest wind that dances gently, now and then picking up a slight gust. The chance for precipitation lingers at a modest 20%, an invitation for soft raindrops that might grace the streets after 11 PM. \n\nTomorrow dawns with a hint of optimism, as the clouds begin to part and allow glimpses of sunlight to filter through. With a high near 66 degrees, it promises to be a pleasant day, albeit cool, with temperatures easing into the lower 60s by afternoon. The winds will remain brisk, caressing the city\u2019s iconic landmarks with refreshing breezes. One might consider layering; a light jacket over a shirt would suit the temperament of this changing atmosphere. As the day unfolds, it presents numerous possibilities: a stroll along Embarcadero, perhaps a quiet caf\u00e9 visit to savor a warm beverage, or simply a leisurely exploration of the waterfront basked in the soft embrace of sunshine.",
