    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco embraces a gentle tranquility beneath a mostly clear sky, the air cooling down to a comfortable embrace around fifty degrees. A mild breeze from the north carries with it the crispness of the day\u2019s end, setting the stage for a serene evening where the lights of the city begin to twinkle against the darkening backdrop. \n\nAs dawn approaches tomorrow, San Francisco will awaken to a day painted with golden sunshine, gracing the skyline with warmth, peaking at a blissful seventy degrees before gradually descending to around sixty-four in the afternoon. The north-northeast winds will lazily drift through the city, providing a soft reminder of the ocean's proximity. The absence of fog signifies a refreshing clarity, inviting residents and visitors alike to step outside and bask in the uplifting light. For attire, layering remains wise: a light jacket in the morning\u2019s coolness gives way to short sleeves by midday as the sun breaks through. A leisurely stroll through the waterfront or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 could be just the thing to savor this inspiring day, embodying the essence of San Francisco in its unhurried rhythm.",
