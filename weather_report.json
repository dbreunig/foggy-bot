    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, the city greets the day with a mostly sunny disposition, a calm that stands in stark contrast to the swirling fog that often blankets its iconic hills. The air is cool, with a high hovering near 60 degrees, gently sinking to a more subdued 56 as afternoon beckons; this respite invites residents to embrace the crispness without the chill that can sometimes linger. The gentle north-northwest breeze carries whispers of promise, as the sun casts a warm glow over the landscape, revealing familiar silhouettes like the Golden Gate Bridge emerging from the clear haze\u2014a quiet beacon amidst the Pacific\u2019s embrace.\n\nYet, as twilight approaches, the skies will shift, painting a more somber picture. Clouds will gather, weaving a tapestry of shadows that may herald the arrival of light rain after the witching hour. With temperatures dipping to a comfortable low around 49, the evening will call for an extra layer\u2014a well-fitted sweater should suffice, ensuring warmth without stifling the breath of a fresh breeze. Given the day\u2019s mix of promise and impending shifts, consider a leisurely stroll along one of the many waterfront paths, where the mingling scents of saltwater and earth provide a soothing backdrop, adding a touch of tranquility amidst the city\u2019s heartbeat.",
