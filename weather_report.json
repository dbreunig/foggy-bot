    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of clouds stretches across the sky, hinting at the rain that will soon grace the city. Currently, the air is tinged with the promise of a gentle sprinkle, a softness that demands a light jacket and perhaps a snug pair of shoes for those meandering through the streets. The sun, still shy, plays hide-and-seek behind the clouds, with the chill lingering around 53 degrees, nudging one towards warm layers to fend off the dampness that is likely to seep in.\n\nThe day ahead anticipates a continued drizzle, accompanied by gusty breezes that whip at about 10 to 16 mph. The high will barely rise to 58, creating an atmosphere that feels both cool and contemplative\u2014ideal for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 where the warmth of coffee cradles your hands. The clouds may obscure some of the iconic sights, yet there is a certain beauty in the muted tones of the city, a calm stillness punctuated by the rhythmic patter of rain against the pavement. Those seeking solace outdoors might find it best to embrace the weather, explore sheltered areas like the Ferry Building Marketplace, or simply take in the moody charm of a city that thrives even in the soft embrace of rain and fog.",
