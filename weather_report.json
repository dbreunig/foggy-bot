    "weather_report": "This afternoon, Downtown San Francisco embraces a serene clarity, with the sun gracefully illuminating the skyline, casting golden hues over its iconic landmarks. The temperatures rest comfortably in the low sixties, offering a gentle warmth that yields to a cooling breeze from the west. As the afternoon unfolds, the winds, brisk and purposeful, rustle through the neighborhoods, creating a soft symphony that whispers of the ocean and the nearby hills. While some coastal fog may linger just beyond the city\u2019s embrace, its presence is more a distant ghost than an encumbering shroud today.\n\nAs evening approaches, the city will don a more muted palette, transitioning into partly cloudy skies that cradle a coolness, settling around fifty-one degrees. The west-southwest winds will continue to playfully dance, slightly more subdued yet still insisting on their lively role. For those venturing out, a light jacket is prudent, perhaps layered over a comfortable shirt, preparing for the chill that follows the sun's retreat. Strolling along the Embarcadero or enjoying a quiet moment in a local caf\u00e9, one can appreciate how the day gracefully unfolds into evening\u2014a perfect backdrop for a leisurely exploration of what the city has to offer.",
