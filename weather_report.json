    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the evening ushered in a soft embrace of partly cloudy skies, shaping a gentle ambiance that\u2019s distinctly refreshing. With the temperature dipping to around 52 degrees, the chill of the evening air combines beautifully with the brisk breeze flowing in from the west, offering a lively dance of 12 to 18 mph. The high of the day lingered around 63, but as night carries on, those temperatures will settle comfortably, ideal for a light jacket or sweater, perhaps accompanied by a scarf for added warmth.\n\nThe clarity of the sky speaks to a quiet charm, devoid of the usual fog that sometimes blankets the city. On this particular night, one might stroll along the waterfront, taking in the soft glow of lights that shimmer across the bay, or perhaps enjoy a quiet moment in a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a warm cup of coffee or tea. The gentle wind invites you to take a leisurely walk through the vibrant streets, where the city's energy is palpable but not overwhelming, allowing for a pleasant and unhurried exploration of the evening.",
