The west wind dances at 18 miles per hour, bringing with it a crispness that invigorates the bustling streets. With mostly clear skies overhead, the low forecast is a comforting 53 degrees, a gentle reminder of the cool Pacific air that characterizes this harbor city.\n\nThe horizon reveals no significant fog to mar the view, but a delicate marine layer whispers along the edges, hinting at the characteristic coastal mist. For a pleasant outing, light layers will suffice\u2014perhaps a soft sweater thrown over a t-shirt for those who plan to linger outdoors as twilight unfurls its stars. It's a night to stroll the quieter streets, perhaps stopping for a cup of coffee in one of the neighborhood caf\u00e9s or enjoying a leisurely meal beneath the gentle evening sky. With this agreeable weather and a vibrant city at your fingertips, the possibilities for quiet exploration are abundant.",
