    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, today unfolds with a tentative embrace of sunlight, muted yet pleasant. The afternoon invites a gentle warmth, reaching towards a comfortable 62 degrees, the air lightly stirred by a west wind that dances through the streets at about 15 miles per hour, occasionally gusting to 22. As evening approaches, clouds begin to gather, and the allure of the city softens under their gray hue, hinting at a night of patchy drizzle scheduled after the witching hour. With temperatures dipping to around 56, the breeze will remain, a breath of coolness shifting from the west-southwest, reminding us that even in summer, this city loves to keep its secrets veiled in mist.\n\nAs the day wanes, the expanse of the bay may reveal a hint of fog, particularly towards the bridge, painting the landscape in soft strokes of gray and silver. This atmospheric intimacy makes a stroll along the waterfront rather appealing, where one might find solace in the quaint cafes offering warm brews, perfect for cradling between one\u2019s palms against the evening chill. Layering is key today; a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the briskness, perhaps accompanied by a leisurely scarf for additional comfort. As twilight deepens, it is a splendid time to linger just a bit longer at the park or plan a cozy evening indoors, where the sights and sounds of the city can be enjoyed from a warm corner, savoring a good book or company, all while the gentle patter of drizzle creates a soothing soundtrack to the night.",
