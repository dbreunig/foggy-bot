    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the chill in the air is gently countered by the promise of a mostly sunny day. Highs will hover near a comfortable 65, transitioning to a cooler 63 as the afternoon unfolds. The brisk west-southwest winds, whistling at 10 to 22 mph, bring a lively energy to the morning, while gusts may leap to 28 mph, stirring the city awake. The day promises clarity, yet nature\u2019s playful touch may linger as wisps of fog flirt with the edges of the Golden Gate, retreating into the embrace of the bay.\n\nTonight, a quiet shift to partly cloudy skies will usher in a low as mild as 54, with winds continuing their gentle serenade. This blend of weather calls for layers\u2014 a light jacket will serve as your companion, balancing comfort with the brisk breeze. As you plan your day, why not take a contemplative stroll along the Embarcadero? The lively atmosphere of the waterfront juxtaposed with the tranquil beauty of the bay invites moments of introspection and connection. A visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm cup, watching the world pass by, sounds not only pleasant but profoundly satisfying.",
