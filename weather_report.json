Still, an added layer might be prudent as twilight approaches, particularly if one plans to stroll along the waterfront or beneath the city\u2019s starry canopy. Casual, light clothing paired with a warm cardigan or jacket will harmonize nicely with the fresh sea air, making for a pleasant outing. The picturesque conditions invite leisurely strolls through nearby parks or intimate gatherings in cozy caf\u00e9s, as the day gracefully transitions into night.
