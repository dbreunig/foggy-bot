The clouds blanket the sky in a muted gray, giving the city a soft, delicate air that speaks to the whispers of spring, even as gusts from the south-southwest dance through the streets. A low temperature snugly embracing 54 degrees suggests dressing in layers\u2014a lightweight jacket over a cozy sweater would keep you comfortable against the evening chill. \n\nLooking to tomorrow, one might anticipate a day that straddles the line between cloudy and partly sunny, with a greater chance for rainfall as the hours progress. It\u2019s a perfect time to explore cozy local spots, perhaps a quiet caf\u00e9 where warm drinks await, or a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where you might catch a fleeting glimpse of the elusive marine layer rolling over the hills. On days like these, the aesthetic beauty of the city unfolds in subtle shades rather than bold strokes, inviting reflection rather than rush, allowing for a gentle embrace from that quintessential San Francisco charm tinged with a wistful air.",
