    "weather_report": "As afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a gentle warmth, inviting you outside. The city boasts a partly sunny demeanor, allowing the soft embrace of light to filter through a light veil of clouds. The iconic contours of the Golden Gate Bridge can be discerned with clarity, though the air still hints at the coolness typical of the area. While temperatures hover near 60, a slight drop to 57 beckons as the afternoon progresses, underscored by a delicate westerly breeze. \n\nAs evening approaches, a chance of rain emerges on the horizon, cloaked in the promise of overnight clouds. With nighttime temperatures rising slightly, one might notice a chill in the air, a whisper of 49 degrees inviting layered attire \u2014 a light jacket accompanied by a cozy scarf. The forecast sprinkles in a 30% chance of precipitation, suggesting that one should be prepared for a soft patter from the heavens. Given this blend of moderating warmth, impending clouds, and the impending droplet dance of rain, a stroll through the city, perhaps towards a local caf\u00e9, could offer a soothing respite, allowing you to enjoy the tranquil urban charm before the rain arrives.",
