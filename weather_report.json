    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls across Downtown San Francisco, the city is wrapped in a light embrace of partly cloudy skies. The temperature sits comfortably at around 53 degrees, with a gentle southwest breeze whispering through the streets. This tranquil night will give way to a radiant Tuesday, where the sun will ascend majestically, caressing the day with warmth and light. Expect highs near 65, though a modest retreat to the low 60s will accompany the afternoon, as a west-southwest wind dances at 7 to 13 mph, occasionally gusting to 18 mph, reminiscent of a playful breeze inviting you to step outside.\n\nIn terms of visibility, the sunlit backdrop promises clarity, gently pushing away any lingering haze. The marine layer, typical of this coastal locale, should retreat as the day progresses, revealing the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the vibrant skyline. For those venturing out, dressing in layers will serve well; a light jacket or sweater will keep you cozy against the morning chill, while a comfortable shirt will be perfect for the balmy midday sun. Consider activities that resonate with the day's inviting atmosphere: a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps, or a small cafe visit, savoring the simple pleasures of a coffee while watching the city's rhythm awaken. It is a day that beckons for quiet moments and simple joys amidst the stunning backdrop of San Francisco.",
