    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the skies find themselves adorned in a gentle, sunny embrace, though clouds hint at a subtle shift. The air, cool yet invigorating, has high temperatures at around 64, softening to 62 as the afternoon progresses, accompanied by a brisk breeze from the west-southwest which invigorates the spirit but might also play playfully with your hair. As twilight descends, expect a shift into a more subdued atmosphere, with clouds gathering to drape the city like a light shawl, and temperatures dipping to a comfortable 54.\n\nAs you breathe in the mix of city sounds and scents, the visibility is mostly clear, although the telltale marine layer may linger around the horizon, softly veiling the Golden Gate. Fog, if present, shouldn't obscure the day's simple pleasures. Attire yourself in layers\u2014a light jacket over a breathable shirt would suit well for the cool wind that asks for a touch of warmth as evening arrives. Such an alluring day invites tranquil walks through the historic streets, perhaps with a paper cup of coffee in hand, or a leisurely browse among the local shops that reflect the heart of this vibrant city. A visit to your favorite cozy caf\u00e9 for a book to savor would suit the evening quite splendidly.",
