    "weather_report": "In the gentle embrace of a San Francisco morning, the city slowly awakens, draped in a delicate veil of fog that lingers before retreating. As the sun rises, a soft clarity blankets the skyline, hinting at a glorious day ahead. The temperature, comfortably settling near 66 degrees, is likely to dip slightly as afternoon edges in, but for now, mildness wafts through the air, accented by a light, whispering breeze from the southwest. While the marine layer is still brushing against the hills, it is not enough to mar the promise of sunshine, inviting those familiar with the city's mercurial weather to step outside and savor the unfolding day.\n\nAs you begin your morning, consider dressing in layers\u2014a lightweight jacket to ward off the cooler air beneath the sun's nurturing rays, and perhaps a comfortable pair of shoes for a leisurely stroll. The atmosphere beckons you to enjoy the understated pleasures of the season: a relaxed walk through the park, a quiet moment with a good book at a caf\u00e9, or even a visit to the local market, where the vibrant colors of fresh produce mirror the awakening city. As evening approaches, the skies will clear further into a cobalt canvas, balancing perfectly the warmth of the day and the cool whispers of the night ahead.",
