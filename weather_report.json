    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a mostly sunny sky, a welcome reprieve from the typical fog that often cloaks the city. The air carries a crispness, with temperatures hovering near a refreshingly cool 60 degrees, subtly descending as the day meanders into its later hours. A light west northwest breeze whispers through the streets, gently stirring leaves as it brings a slight chill, punctuated only by the occasional gust that dances through the avenues.\n\nAs the daylight wanes, expect a gradual shift to partly cloudy skies, yet the beauty of the fading light will still grace the horizon. With nighttime temperatures settling around a comfortable 50 degrees, a light jacket or sweater will suffice for those venturing out. This evening beckons with the promise of quiet walks along the waterfront or leisurely explorations through the neighborhoods, where the vibrant spirit of the city comes alive, even at dusk. It is an inviting tableau, perfect for a simple evening stroll or an impromptu meet-up with friends, as the city\u2019s gentle rhythms inspire an unhurried pace.",
