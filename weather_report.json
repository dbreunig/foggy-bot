    "weather_report": "As the early hours of this Tuesday unfurl over Downtown San Francisco, the city breathes in the freshness of a mostly clear night, where the comfortable temperature hovers gently around 55 degrees. A whisper of a southwest breeze makes its way through the streets, creating a serene atmosphere that carries the promise of a sunlit day ahead. \n\nCome morning, the city will unfurl into a radiant canvas, bathed in golden sunlight that will peak near 65 degrees before retiring to a cooler 61 by afternoon. The west-southwest winds will add a playful touch, hinting at breezy gusts that may reach 18 mph, which could make one feel a delightful chill as the sun blankets San Francisco. Although the fog is slight, the glory of a clear, warm day invites one to venture outdoors. Ideal attire would favor layers: a light sweater for the cool mornings, giving way to a short-sleeved shirt as the sun rises high. The energy of the day beckons walks along the waterfront, leisurely visits to local caf\u00e9s, or perhaps even a turn through one of the city\u2019s vibrant parks. With the allure of the sun shining brightly, the day is yours to explore, offering moments of quiet reflection or warm connections with fellow wanderers.",
