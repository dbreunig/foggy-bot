    "weather_report": "As twilight wraps itself around Downtown San Francisco, the sky remains predominantly clear, with soft whispers of wind dancing through the air. With temperatures settling around a mild 52 degrees, there's a gentle chill that nudges one towards light layers. The absence of fog paints the landscape in vivid clarity, allowing the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate and the city\u2019s skyline to stand sharp against the deepening blue of the sky. Travelers and locals are treated to a stunning view, making the evening strolls or the quiet moment on a favorite park bench a delightful pursuit.\n\nAs Sunday dawns, the sun will grace the city with its presence, promising a charming day of warmth that peaks near the coast at 59 degrees, eventually dipping slightly as the sun shifts. The breeze, robust yet manageable, suggests optimism for outdoor activities; perhaps a leisurely visit to the nearby cafes or an exploration of hidden neighborhoods, where quaint shops and art galleries await. Layering up with a light jacket and some comfortable shoes is advisable as you venture out, ensuring you're both stylish and comfortable amid these serene urban vibes.",
