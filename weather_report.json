The sky is mostly clear, allowing the gentle, muted light to wash over the landscape with a serene clarity that often eludes this city known for its sweeping fog. You might spot the faint trace of a marine layer swirling its tendrils around the outer edges of the bay, a reminder of the ocean\u2019s embrace, but for now, the heart of the city sits bathed in tranquility, unclouded and inviting.\n\nTemperatures will climb steadily to a comfortable high, resting around 60 degrees. This delicate play between warmth and coolness invites you to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a T-shirt, so you can adapt as the sun rises and begins its descent through the afternoon. The soft breath of the southwest wind will brush against you here and there, a cool caress that further enhances the day\u2019s pleasantness. With these conditions, it might be an ideal time to stroll through a local park, savoring the scents of freshly blossoming flowers and the informal chatter of morning coffee seekers. Perhaps a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 would suit the mood, where you can settle into a cozy corner with a book, taking in the gentle buzz of life unfurling before you.",
