    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a bright sun, painting the city in warm hues while a steady breeze stirs the air. While the temperature nudges close to a brisk 63 degrees, it gently dips to a more comfortable 61, complemented by gusty winds from the west-southwest, creating a refreshing atmosphere. The sky is clear, a welcome canvas for those looking to enjoy the sights, yet the typical summer marine layer threatens to intrude later, lingering on the horizon.\n\nAs evening descends, the gentle embrace of partly cloudy skies invites a more relaxed ambiance, with temperatures settling around 56. The winds remain a loyal companion, continuing their playful dance at 20 to 24 mph, transforming the city into a genuinely dynamic experience. In this context, dressing in layers\u2014think light sweaters or jackets\u2014will ensure you are both comfortable and stylish, while evening strolls along the waterfront beckon with promises of serene views. Seek out a local caf\u00e9 or park bench to comfortably observe the city\u2019s transitions\u2014both in light and energy\u2014before the sun slips away. The day unfolds like a soft melody, inviting you to artfully weave your moments within its rhythm.",
