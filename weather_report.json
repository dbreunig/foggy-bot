    "weather_report": "As night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the skies are partly cloaked in delicate clouds, inviting a gentle breeze to dance through the city. With temperatures resting comfortably around 51 degrees, the west-southwest wind whispers at a steady pace, its gusts occasionally nudging the crisp air, perfect for a light jacket or a cozy shawl. While there may be hints of fog lingering near the Golden Gate and along coastal stretches, fog's embrace is absent from the heart of the city tonight, allowing the soft twinkling of city lights to breathe and shine.\n\nTomorrow unfolds with promise as the sun rises and bathes the city in a warm embrace of mostly sunny skies. Expect temperatures to hover near a pleasant 61 degrees before gradually softening to a cooler 59 in the afternoon, as a similar wind plays its symphony throughout the day. It\u2019s a lovely scene for a casual stroll along the waterfront or a quiet afternoon spent in Golden Gate Park. Dress in layers to fully appreciate this transitional day; light layers can keep you comfortable as the cool air gives way to fleeting warmth. For those seeking simple pleasures, consider a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or perhaps a leisurely read in one of the city\u2019s many serene gardens, where nature quietly flourishes amidst the urban rhythm.",
