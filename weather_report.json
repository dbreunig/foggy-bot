    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sky wears a cloak of mostly sunny tranquility, beckoning with a comfortable warmth as the mercury hovers near 64 degrees. A gentle west-southwest breeze nudges through the streets, occasionally punctuated by spirited gusts, a refreshing reminder of summer\u2019s caresses. However, as the sun begins to surrender its reign, a shift to more cloud-draped ambiance awaits, hinting at the arrival of cooler air.\n\nAs the evening approaches, the city may don a more muted presence, with mostly cloudy skies asserting themselves and temperatures dipping to around 57. The marine layer dances quietly in the distance, its ghostly tendrils creeping along the coastal edges but not overpowering the vibrant cityscape. Such cool evenings call for a light jacket, a woolen sweater, or perhaps a casual scarf to ward off the slight chill that accompanies the transition from day to night. Given these conditions, a stroll through the serene streets might be in order, perhaps followed by a cozy coffee in a nearby caf\u00e9, allowing the day's warmth to linger just a little longer in the heart before nightfall arrives.",
