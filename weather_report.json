    "weather_report": "As we step into the day, Downtown San Francisco greets us with that characteristic chill, lingering from an early drizzle before banquetting in sunlight. At this moment, the skies appear to be shedding their gray blanket, ushering in the pleasant sight of blue streaks, though a hint of haze still lingers, perhaps from the faint embrace of the marine layer. The air is brisk, stirred by the west-southwest winds, which add a lively note to the otherwise serene atmosphere.\n\nThe high is projected to hover around a refreshing 63 degrees, giving one ample opportunity to dress thoughtfully. A light jacket is advisable for those venturing out early, while layering becomes the order of the day as the sun rises higher. As the evening draws close, you can expect the mercury to retreat slightly, melding into a comfortable 56 degrees with clouds creeping back in, inviting you to cozy up. The winds, steady yet gentle, lend themselves well to a stroll around the waterfront or perhaps an afternoon venture into the cultural heart of the city. It is a day to appreciate both the light and shadows, the fleeting warmth and the ever-present cool\u2014a snapshot of San Francisco's timeless charm.",
