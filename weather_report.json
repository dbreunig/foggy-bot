Despite the buildup of warmth to around 69 degrees, a cool breath from the west southwest whispers through the streets, reminding one of the ocean's proximity. As the sun descends into the latter hours, temperatures are likely to mellow into the mid-sixties, while the drifting winds maintain a light yet refreshing pace. \n\nAs twilight approaches, there\u2019s a hint of unpredictability with the promise of patchy drizzle after 11 PM, encroaching on the evening's serenity. The forecast suggests a shift toward mostly cloudy skies, hinting at the haunting embrace of the marine layer that could drift in from the bay. Donning layers appears wise\u2014a comfortable combination of light sweaters or jackets will help navigate the shifting temperatures, while an umbrella might be a prudent companion as daylight yields to evening chill. For the rest of the afternoon, a stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 sounds enticing. One might even be tempted to linger outside, engaging in quiet conversation while soaking in the essence of the city glistening under a fading golden sun.",
