    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a canopy of mostly sunny skies. A gentle west-southwest breeze carries hints of salt and clarity, making for a pleasantly temperate morning with a high near 66. The air, refreshed by the night, begins to warm just enough to coax locals outdoors. As the day progresses toward afternoon, the temperatures will gracefully dip to around 64, a familiar cadence for this coastal enclave. While visibility should remain largely unobstructed, the whispers of cloud may start to gather, casting a soft veil across the horizon.\n\nTonight, the atmosphere will transition, draping itself in a tapestry of clouds as the night unfolds. Expect a calm dip to around 58, with those same gentle winds rustling through the eucalyptus and palm-lined streets. For dress, consider layering; a light jacket should serve well against the evening chill, especially if venturing along the waterfront where the breeze is particularly invigorating. Today invites leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero, perhaps a cozy afternoon coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9, or a visit to a local bookstore, losing oneself among the shelves as the cloud cover thickens. With the day offering the sort of charm that only San Francisco can provide, it's a perfect time to embrace the city's energy in simple, enriching ways.",
