    "weather_report": "Under a canopy of mostly sunny skies, Downtown San Francisco greets the day with a sense of calm, as the sun quietly bathes the city in a soft golden light. The high of 58 degrees casts a pleasant embrace on those who venture outdoors, although the afternoon will gently slide into a cooler 56, inviting light layers to keep at bay the lingering chill of early spring. With the west-northwest winds whispering softly at 3 to 10 mph, any unsettled feeling is soothed, and the air carries a crispness that feels invigorating.\n\nHowever, the day's serenity is set to transform, with clouds gathering strength as the evening approaches. By nighttime, the first whispers of rain will make their entrance, bringing a 90% chance of sprinkles after 11 PM as the city dons its more introspective attire. The temperature will dip to a cozy 49 degrees, nudging you toward warmer garments\u2014perhaps a well-loved sweater accompanied by a pair of sturdy shoes for any evening outings. Given the day\u2019s trajectory, one might relish an afternoon stroll along the Embarcadero, savoring a warm beverage as the soft murmur of the bay unfolds before you. While the promise of clouds and rain looms on the horizon, the beauty in the temporary solitude of late afternoon offers a reminder of nature's delicate balance.",
