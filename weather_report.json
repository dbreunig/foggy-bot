    "weather_report": "The sun rises confidently over Downtown San Francisco, painting the sky in a soft blue with only the faintest whispers of passing clouds. Today\u2019s forecast promises a sunny respite, with temperatures climbing to a comfortable 70 degrees before settling to a cozy 68 in the afternoon. The gentle breeze from the west-northwest adds a refreshing touch, barely stirring at 3 to 9 mph. As the morning unfolds, the air remains clear, with no fog to shroud the iconic skyline or obscure views of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nAs the day transitions into evening, the clarity persists, giving way to a peaceful night under a star-speckled sky, where temperatures drop to around 52. With such pleasant weather, a light jacket should serve well for those venturing into the twilight. Consider taking a leisurely stroll through the vibrant streets of the Mission or enjoying a quiet moment by the waterfront. The warmth of the day and the calm of the evening invite a chance to appreciate the beauty surrounding this remarkable city, making for a splendid day to explore at a leisurely pace.",
