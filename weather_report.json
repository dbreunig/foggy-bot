    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night wraps around the city cloaked in a blanket of clouds, a soft embrace that brings a hint of coolness, resting gently at around fifty-four degrees. The night breeze whispers secrets as it travels from the southwest at thirteen miles per hour, inviting passersby to wear a light jacket or layer. As dawn approaches, the promise of a mostly sunny Wednesday unfolds, bringing a mild high of sixty-four. By afternoon, temperatures will settle into a more moderate sixty-one, tempered by the playful gusts of the west-southwest winds, reaching up to twenty-one miles per hour and accompanied by even stronger bursts that might rustle the leaves and tousle hair.\n\nThe morning light will reveal the city draped in an ethereal sheen, yet hints of fog may linger on the edges, softening the skyline where the Golden Gate Bridge meets the horizon. Those venturing out may find it invigorating to stroll through the parks, or perhaps enjoy a quiet moment with a warm beverage at their favorite outdoor caf\u00e9. The delicate interplay of light and shadow promises a day that feels both refreshing and rejuvenating, a perfect backdrop for reflective walks or casual outings\u2014ideal for savoring the gentle rhythm of life in this coastal gem.",
