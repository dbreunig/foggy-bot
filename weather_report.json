    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day begins with a vibrant blue sky, announcing a promising stretch of sunshine. The warmth creeps in gently, with temperatures hovering around a pleasant 66 degrees before settling into a cozy 64 by afternoon. Despite the ascending mercury, the air carries a soft breeze from the west-southwest, rousing the subtle dance of leaves and whispering through the streets\u2014a perfect companion for your morning wanderings. Yet, in classic San Francisco fashion, the marine layer lingers just beyond the city's skyline, hinting at the fog\u2019s playful presence, yet today, it remains a distant memory, allowing clarity to reign supreme.\n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will maintain their clarity, transitioning to a comfortable low of 56 as the day settles into twilight. The same soft winds with fleeting gusts will continue to grace the air, ensuring the coolness wraps around you like a familiar scarf. Dressing in layers is wise, with perhaps a light sweater for the fading daylight, allowing for ease as you stroll through neighborhoods, sip coffee at a quaint caf\u00e9, or take a moment to observe the vibrant pulse of city life. With such auspicious weather, it is an ideal day for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or a visit to nearby parks, absorbing the invigorating atmosphere while it lasts.",
