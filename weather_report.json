    "weather_report": "As the sun casts its golden rays upon Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in a splendid moment of clarity. The air carries a refreshing coolness, complemented by a westerly breeze that whispers through the streets at nearly 24 mph, a lively companion nudging along the day\u2019s pulse. Temperatures hover around the low sixties, teetering gently toward the pleasant embrace of 60 degrees as the afternoon sets in. While some may note the absence of the infamous fog that often cloaks the area, remnants of a marine layer linger in the distance, suggesting the ocean's breath is close at hand, yet today it grants the skyline a crystal-clear panorama that is not to be taken lightly.\n\nThis is one of those sunlit afternoons that beckons for a casual stroll along the waterfront or a serene moment at a caf\u00e9 where the aromas of fresh-brewed coffee intermingle with the salty sea air. Dressing in layers is wise; a light sweater or jacket will comfortably shield you from the breezy gusts while allowing you to soak in the sun's warmth. As the evening approaches and temperatures dip, a cozy wrap will ensure you remain enveloped in comfort while the day gives way to a peaceful night. Choose to embrace the subtle beauty of this Juneteenth, where clear skies and gentle winds create a perfect backdrop for both reflection and connection.",
