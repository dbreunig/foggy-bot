    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the air clings with the soft, damp reminder of a gentle drizzle that kissed the city overnight. The temperature hovers comfortably around fifty-six degrees, inviting a light jacket or a cozy sweater, ideal for those venturing out for an early stroll. The morning sky, painted with patches of cloud, offers a hint of promise\u2014a slight chance of drizzle lingers just before the late-morning sun begins its ascent, dispelling the remnants of night. \n\nAs the sun climbs higher, it sheds its golden light across the skyline, ushering in a predominantly sunny afternoon. Expect temperatures to peak near sixty-five, before easing to a cooler sixty-three as the day matures. A refreshing west-southwest breeze dances through the streets, whispering at speeds of eight to twenty miles per hour, occasionally gusting higher, making this a delightful day to explore outdoor cafes or to wander through the lush expanses of Golden Gate Park. It remains a day of pleasant charm, trimmed by an awareness of that ever-present marine layer prowling just beyond the bridge, while the city awakens to the calm of fog\u2019s embrace, softening the urban panorama. \n\nChoosing comfortable layers is wise; a light sweater for the morning chill and perhaps a windbreaker or a light scarf for later as the breeze picks up. This day holds the perfect balance for a relaxed pace\u2014whether to enjoy a leisurely breakfast at a favorite haunt or to breathe in the beauty of a bookshop and its curated corners. Each moment invites a pause, and as the sun rises, so too does the potential for delightful discoveries in this enchanting city.",
