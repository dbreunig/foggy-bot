    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, a soft veil of clouds embraces the city, quelling the day's fading warmth. The current temperature hovers at a gentle 56 degrees, with the breeze whispering through the streets, carrying a hint of coolness from the west southwest. The wind, unpredictable yet invigorating, dances between 12 to 18 mph, occasionally surging with playful gusts that rattle the branches above. \n\nTomorrow promises a shift in atmosphere, as the sun peeks through this somber shroud, revealing a predominantly sunny disposition. The high of 67 will provide a comforting backdrop to early autumn activities, eventually tapering off around 65 in the afternoon. For the time being, however, the evening beckons for layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket or sweater to ward off the evening chill. As you emerge from your dwelling, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the sounds of distant chatter intermingle with the gentle lapping of waves. Alternatively, a quiet caf\u00e9 awaits, where you can savor a warm drink while watching the fog gracefully envelop the skyline, wrapping the city in its silken embrace.",
