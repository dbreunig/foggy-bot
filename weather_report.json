    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the current afternoon is exceptionally inviting, graced with a sunny disposition that paints the skyline in hues of blue. With temperatures hovering around the low sixties, a gentle west-southwest breeze dances through the streets, pleasantly cool but not biting, reminiscent of the sea whispering against the shore. The horizon, stretching toward the Golden Gate, appears mostly clear as the sunlight bathes the cityscape, although hints of fog linger like soft whispers along the coastal edges, teasing the imagination with dreams of maritime adventure.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent, anticipate a transition to a more subdued evening, where clouds will drift in with a gentle embrace, wrapping the city in a cozy shroud. Tonight's low, resting around fifty-two degrees, calls for a light sweater or a comfortable jacket, perfect for those strolling through illuminated streets or sitting at tucked-away caf\u00e9s, sipping on warm chai or perhaps a glass of wine. With the air carrying the slightest scent of saltwater, it's a splendid opportunity for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the twinkling lights reflect upon the bay and create an picturesque scene, inviting one to pause and reflect on the day.",
