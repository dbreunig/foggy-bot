    "weather_report": "In the embrace of morning, Downtown San Francisco awakens beneath a canopy of brilliant sunshine, the streets stirring softly as the light spills over the skyline. The temperature, a gentle 72 degrees, nudges the day toward a charming warmth, set against a whispering southwest breeze. As we approach the afternoon, the mercury may dip slightly, but the sunshine promises to remain a steadfast companion, illuminating the city in a golden hue. It\u2019s a day free of the fog that often cloaks the Bay, with clarity stretching toward the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, rendering the view crisp and inviting.\n\nAs night approaches, the charm of the lingering warmth will give way to a softer ambiance, a transition to a cool and mostly clear evening at around 53 degrees. Those venturing out might consider layered clothing\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a lightweight jacket for the evening strolls along the waterfront. It\u2019s the perfect backdrop for a leisurely walk through the park or a quiet moment with a book at a cozy caf\u00e9, the kind of day that calls for savoring the simplicity of life under an expansive sky.",
