    "weather_report": "As dawn silently breaks over the city, a thick veil of clouds stretches over Downtown San Francisco, carrying the promise of a night drenched in rain. The air feels crisp, almost edgy, brushing against the skin. With a temperature lingering in the chill of the early forties, the wind, a playful yet formidable presence, sweeps down from the West at a brisk pace, setting the stage for an unsettled day ahead. The forecast speaks of rain beginning in the early hours and carrying through, with the possibility of thunderstorms adding a dramatic flair to an otherwise routine Tuesday. \n\nExpect the heavens to open wide, drenching the city with substantial rainfall; local puddles may emerge where sunlight rarely ventures. The atmosphere is laden with the scent of wet earth and ocean mist, yet one might still yearn for adventure amid the overcast. It is best to dress in layers to combat the chill, opting for waterproof attire coupled with sturdy shoes\u2014perfect for navigating the slick streets that will soon teem with droplets. As the storm brews, consider seeking refuge in one of the cozy corners of a downtown caf\u00e9, perhaps curled up with a good book as the world outside dances beneath the rain's relentless rhythm. Alternatively, an impromptu visit to a local museum may prove gratifying, sheltering you from the elements while feeding your curiosity.",
