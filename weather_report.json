    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the day unfolds under a mostly sunny sky, the sun casting a warm glow across the city as a gentle southwest breeze meanders through the streets. Yet, as the sun descends, a shift is anticipated, bringing with it a hint of the evening's promise. By nightfall, clouds will roll in, with rain showers likely making their appearance past 11 PM. The day's warmth will give way to a cooler embrace, inviting residents to wrap themselves in layers for comfort as they navigate the transition from day to night.\n\nThough the sun shines brightly now, hints of an encroaching marine layer may linger along the coast, suggesting a potential haziness that obscures distant vistas. A light jacket or sweater would serve well against the chilly breeze that lingers through the evening, especially if one finds oneself outdoors, enjoying the city\u2019s vibrant scenes or a leisurely walk along the waterfront. This serene afternoon offers the perfect backdrop for simple pleasures\u2014perhaps a stroll through a local park, with the allure of the evening rain serving as a reminder to seek out the warmth of a cozy caf\u00e9 later on.",
