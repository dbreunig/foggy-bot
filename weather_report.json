    "weather_report": "The evening in Downtown San Francisco unfolds with a whisper of clouds draping the city. There is a teasing promise of rain that may drizzle gently before the clock strikes ten, but for now, the air remains cool, settling around 50 degrees, shifting unhurriedly under a westerly breeze. The landscape, veiled in dim illumination from the myriad of city lights, offers glimpses of a typical San Francisco fog that lingers, adding a touch of mystique. Yet, the clouds do not appear thick enough to cloak the iconic Golden Gate Bridge entirely; instead, they frame it, enhancing its allure against the fading light.\n\nAs we look toward the morrow, anticipate a rather cool, mostly cloudy Sunday, with temperatures nudging toward 63 and decreasing as the hours slip by. It would be wise to dress in layers, perhaps a cozy sweater under a light jacket, ready to adapt as the afternoon unfolds. Ideal activities could include a leisurely stroll through the quiet charm of a nearby park, where the damp earth nourishes the burgeoning flora, or discovering a quaint caf\u00e9 where the soft sound of rain mingles with the aroma of roasted coffee. The city's personality reveals itself in these moments of subtle interplay between classic scenery and the quiet pulse of everyday life.",
