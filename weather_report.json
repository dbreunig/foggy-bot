With the sky remaining clear, it\u2019s a wonderful opportunity to take a leisurely walk along the waterfront or savor a quiet moment at a sidewalk caf\u00e9. Dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a long-sleeved shirt\u2014to accommodate the cool evening air while enjoying the lingering warmth of the day. This is a time to relish the beauty of the moment, whether it be through a thoughtful conversation with a friend or simply soaking in the serene atmosphere that descends with dusk.
