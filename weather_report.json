The air is gently stirred by a cool west-southwest breeze, carrying with it the scent of salt and the distant echoes of the bay. With the temperature settling at a cozy 56 degrees, those venturing outdoors tonight will appreciate a light jacket or sweater, a charming companion against the mild chill. \n\nIn the hours to come, the sky will gradually reveal a hint of sunshine, as Wednesday awakens with a promise of partly sunny skies. The temperatures will climb to a pleasant 64 degrees, meandering downward as the afternoon unfolds. Wandering through the streets, one may find themselves charmed by the urban rhythm and the quiet hum of activity, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the warmth of a steaming cup can be savored. The day is laced with delightful possibilities, inviting reflections along the city's iconic vistas, while the occasional gust ruffles the hair and stirs the senses, reminding all that even in the calm, the city retains its wild spirit.",
