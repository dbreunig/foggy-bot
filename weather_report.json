    "weather_report": "As the golden sun ascends, casting its gentle warmth upon Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds mostly sunny, inviting a sense of calm amid the bustling streets. With the air crisp and fresh, the temperature, hovering around a comfortable 62 degrees, encourages you to step outside. A west-southwest wind dances through the city with a lively energy, its gusts creating a refreshing chorus as they weave through the buildings. Yet, as the afternoon progresses, a subtle shift may bring clouds to soften the blue, hinting at the classic San Francisco marine layer that often tiptoes in like an old friend. \n\nAs evening descends, the low will cradle around a balmy 54 degrees, creating an ideal atmosphere for light layers \u2013 perhaps a cozy cardigan or a smart jacket to wrap around your shoulders as you stroll along the waterfront. The mild winds will continue to maintain their presence, perfect for an invigorating walk or a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, savoring a warm beverage while the city breathes around you. Today feels like an embrace, a chance to enjoy the fleeting transitions of light and cloud, inviting you to explore the richness of your surroundings.",
