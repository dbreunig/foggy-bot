    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfurls beneath a sunny sky, the brilliance of light drapes over the city as it beckons residents and visitors alike. With a gentle breeze from the west southwest, the day feels invigorating, promising a high near 65 degrees. The clarity of the air allows the iconic structures, with their unique silhouettes, to stand bold against a canvas of blue. Although hints of a marine layer linger at the edges, obscuring the distant horizons where land meets sea, today is primarily free from the fog that often swathes this city in mystery. \n\nAs twilight approaches, with a low settling around 54 degrees, the evening will likely maintain the charm of the afternoon, albeit with a cool embrace from the southwest winds. It's wise to don layers: a light jacket will offer comfort against the cooling breeze, while a casual scarf might add both style and warmth. With the golden hour inching closer, a walk along the Embarcadero or perhaps a casual sitting at one of the outdoor cafes will surely be a delightful way to savor the closing of the day. The blend of light and warmth invites a leisurely exploration, whether one chooses to indulge in a quiet moment with a book or engage in conversation under the softening light.",
