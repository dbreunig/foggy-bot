The cool air, with a gentle whisper of wind\u2014ranging from friendly to playful\u2014carries the promise of a pleasant day ahead. Overnight temperatures have settled at around 51, a refreshingly crisp reminder of the city's coastal nature, tempered by the delightful caress of westward breezes.\n\nIn the hours to come, the sun will rise to grace the city with its golden hue, pushing temperatures up towards a high of 66. For those wandering the streets, a light jacket or a comfortable layer will suffice as the warmth of the day catches hold, but be mindful as the afternoon chill arrives. The gentle shift of the breeze, with occasional gusts reminiscent of whispers weaving through the bustling city life, will keep spirits high. The marine layer may linger close to the coast, but the fog appears to be holding back, granting a far-reaching view of iconic landmarks that speak to the city's history and culture. It\u2019s a day that beckons for quiet strolls through the historic alleys or a leisurely caf\u00e9 visit, where one might sip a warm brew while watching the world embrace the day's unfolding beauty.",
