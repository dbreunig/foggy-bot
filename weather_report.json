    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the skyline is cloaked in a gentle layer of marine fog, wispy and transient, weaving through the city's contours. Tonight\u2019s weather carries with it a cool embrace, with temperatures hovering around 57 degrees, whispered along by a brisk west-southwest wind that dances between 9 to 16 miles per hour. The stillness of the night is pierced only by the occasional gust, a reminder that the coastal atmosphere is ever-changing. \n\nLooking towards tomorrow, the sun will make a resolute appearance, breaking through the clouds and casting a warm glow on the cityscape. With highs expected near 67 and a slight dip to around 65 as the day unfolds, it will be a day of comfortable warmth, tempered by the familiar coastal breeze. In these conditions, a light jacket or sweater will serve well as you stroll along the waterfront or enjoy a leisurely coffee al fresco. The kind of day that invites you to wander through the neighborhoods, perhaps discovering a quaint gallery or a tucked-away bistro, feels perfectly in rhythm with the unfolding afternoon. As the sun traces its path, the soft light will reveal the charm of the city and beckon you to pause for a moment with a good book or a conversation with a friend as the golden hours approach.",
