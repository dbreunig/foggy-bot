    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm descends, framed by the ever-present silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. The skies are mostly clear, punctuated only by a few scattered stars, and the temperature hovers around a mild 56 degrees. A soft north-northwest breeze whispers through the streets, inviting the evening's tranquility to envelop you. It is a night where one could find solace in the quiet company of a book at a cozy caf\u00e9 or perhaps meander along the waterfront, where the lights dance on the bay\u2019s surface, casting reflections that resemble scattered diamonds.\n\nTomorrow beckons with promises of sunshine and warmth, with the temperature reaching a comfortable 77 before settling into the gentle embrace of the afternoon. As the city awakens, the familiar marine layer may seek to roll in but is expected to stay at bay for most of the day. Dressing in layers would be prudent, enabling one to adapt as the sun climbs and cools again towards evening. A leisurely stroll through one of San Francisco\u2019s storied parks or a visit to a nearby gallery would harmonize beautifully with the anticipated weather, allowing both the city and its inhabitants to bask in the rejuvenating glow of spring.",
