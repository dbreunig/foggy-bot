The sky dimly hints at a potential sun, veiled by the marine layer that swirls around the Bay, reminding us of the fog's quiet but persistent embrace. The temperature hovers at a cool 54 degrees, accompanied by a gentle west-southwest wind that stirs softly, whispering through the streets. Though the day may start with the lingering softness of mist, it hints at a transformation, as the sun\u2019s attempts to peek through are foretold for later hours.\n\nAs the afternoon approaches, the chance of drizzle persists, but temperatures will rise slightly, finding solace around 65 degrees before descending gently as evening settles in. The wind, a lively companion, might pick up with gusts, adding a touch of crispness to the air. For those venturing out, layers are key\u2014perhaps a light jacket paired with a scarf, perfect for navigating the ever-changing temperatures. This weather encourages leisurely walks along the waterfront, or perhaps a quiet indulgence in a cozy caf\u00e9 tucked away from the chill, where one can savor a warm beverage while watching the world blur beautifully through the city\u2019s soft haze.",
