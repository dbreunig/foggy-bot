    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a pleasant mosaic of mostly sunny skies, brushed lightly by the soft caress of a west-southwest wind. Today\u2019s high temperature will settle near a comfortable 67 degrees, inviting residents to step outside and bask in the relatively gentle warmth. While the light breeze adds a refreshing touch, expect the temperatures to gradually drop to around 64 in the afternoon, a reminder of the city\u2019s ever-shifting temperament. \n\nAs the sun climbs higher, the clarity of the day will display itself, though whispers of clouds loom in the evening, casting a veil over the night with lows around 57. A delicate dance of winds with gusts reaching up to 20 mph might usher in a subtle chill. One might consider light layers: perhaps a breathable sweater over a tee, ideal for navigating both sunlit streets and the encroaching coolness of dusk. And with such a backdrop, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 beckons, offering a perfect sanctuary to sip coffee while watching the world drift by, as the fog gently lingers in the distance, cradling the skyline like a hushed secret.",
