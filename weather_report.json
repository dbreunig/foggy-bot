    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm envelops the city. The air holds a whisper of coolness, settling around 54 degrees, accompanied by a soft southwest breeze that drifts through the streets like a familiar lullaby. Tonight promises to unveil a partly cloudy sky, leaving open the possibility of a twinkling respite as the stars begin to punctuate the dusky canvas. The lingering marine layer dances along the horizon, caressing the Golden Gate, suggesting a familiar San Francisco magic that melds fog with twilight.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, dawn will greet the city with radiant sunshine, uplifting spirits and invigorating the atmosphere. Temperatures will rise to a comfortable upper 60s before gradually retreating to the mid-60s in the afternoon, while the southwest winds invite playful gusts, bringing life to the day. As you step into the morning, consider layering with a light jacket\u2014pragmatic for the brisk air but easy to shed as the warmth emerges. It is a day made for simple pleasures: perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero soaking in the glistening bay, or enjoying a quiet moment at the ferry building, where the world slows down just enough to savor a rich coffee and a local pastry. With the clarity above and a soft breeze beckoning, it's time to embrace a San Francisco day that melds comfort with exploration, inviting you to discover its quiet heartbeat.",
