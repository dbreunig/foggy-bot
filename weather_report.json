    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the night unfolds under a mostly clear sky, marking a peaceful transition into the early hours with temperatures settling around a cool 51 degrees. The gentle whisper of a southwest breeze dances between buildings, a soft reminder of the city's coastal proximity. Looking ahead to Tuesday, the sun will rise with a promise of mostly sunny skies, brightening the day to a high near 63. As shadows elongate in the afternoon, temperatures will gradually fall, accompanied by winds that might pick up, adding a lively twist to the afternoon air.\n\nThe city may reluctantly share glimpses of fog, likely hugging the water\u2019s edge, but downtown should remain relatively clear, allowing for stunning views across the bay. Dress in layers, embracing the coolness of the evening and the breezy moments of the daytime, perhaps donning a light sweater or jacket for comfort. In this serene setting, a stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to one of the city's cozy cafes would be a delightful way to soak up the mild day while enjoying a warm beverage. The calm morning gives way to a serene afternoon, making it perfect for wandering the city's vibrant streets, exploring local art galleries or savoring lunch outdoors under the clear skies.",
