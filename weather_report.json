The temperature is settling near the threshold of comfort, hovering around 58 degrees, yet there\u2019s a whisper of chill that promises a gradual descent into the afternoon, calling for a light layering that can gracefully transition with the waning sun. The breeze, gently nudging at 9 to 13 mph, carries the salty tang of the bay, a reminder of the aquatic mysteries that hug the coastline.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the cloud cover thickens, heralding a possibility of rain, particularly in the hours hanging between evening and night. While the forecast suggests a mere chance\u201430%\u2014the allure of a soft shower can invigorate the city, painting the pavements in fresh, reflective hues. The evening will usher in darker skies around 50 degrees, giving credence to a cozy night indoors with a book or perhaps a wander into one of the many eclectic local cafes. Consider pulling on a light jacket, not just for warmth but as an invitation to savor the gentle chill of the air. This is a day to find solace in the ordinary, perhaps strolling through the quiet streets, letting the mood of the city wash over you.",
