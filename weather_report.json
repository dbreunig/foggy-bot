    "weather_report": "As midnight unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a delicate veil of cloud hovers gently, perhaps suggesting the sleepy trails of a distant drizzle yet to arrive. The air carries a crispness, hinting at the expected low of around 50 degrees. The west southwest wind whispers softly, reminiscent of ghostly murmurs along the Golden Gate. In this moment, the city's skyline might appear a touch obscured\u2014fleeting shadows playing hide-and-seek with the shimmering lights below.\n\nAs dawn approaches on Wednesday, anticipate a gradual lifting of the skies. A slight chance of morning drizzle lingers briefly, but soon the sun will reveal a modest, sunlit tableau. The horizon, brushed lightly with golden hues, promises warmth amidst cooler breezes, and the invigorating wind will provide a refreshing embrace. While the afternoon brings a high near 59, the chance of fog remains a lowly 20%. Perfect for those who adore the sublime subtlety of nature's transitions, it\u2019s a day to don a light jacket, perhaps layered over a well-fitting sweater. \n\nGiven the day\u2019s gentle invitation, an unhurried stroll through the streets or a visit to a quaint coffee shop could be just right. Seek a peaceful corner, perhaps near the bay, where the water reflects the evolving palette of the skies\u2014enjoying a moment of reflection as the city stirs to life. Let the early whispers of the day beckon you to pause and breathe in the essence of San Francisco, this enduring beauty wrapped softly in an embrace of fog and sunlight.",
