    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a serene calm blankets the city, the skies holding onto clarity as they transition from night to day. The overnight chill clings to the air, hinting at a cool start, but the promise of sunlight will soon warm the streets. With gentle winds whispering from the south, one can expect a gradual lift in spirits as the sun begins its ascent. Today, the city beckons with sunny rays expected to flirt with temperatures nearing pleasant 70 degrees, although a slight reprieve to about 68 is likely as noon approaches, calling for a lightness in both clothing and mood.\n\nFor those stepping out, it\u2019s advisable to embrace layers\u2014a light jacket for the brisk morning air, drifting to a simple tee as the sun reigns. There\u2019s little sign of fog, a welcome contrast to the infamous marine layer that often rolls in; this morning\u2019s visibility offers a clean sweep of the skyline, encouraging leisurely strolls down the Embarcadero or a quiet corner at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf to enjoy a warm cup of coffee. The beauty of such a day unfolds gently, urging you towards the parks or a pleasant visit to a nearby gallery, all framed by the delicate touch of spring. Life feels a touch more vibrant today, resonating with the simplicity of enjoying a clear San Francisco.",
