    "weather_report": "Overnight, the city has donned its cloak of clouds, with a gentle drizzle whispering through the streets, creating a misty veil that softens the world in shades of gray. As the sun rises, this morning's moisture hangs slightly in the air, veiling the skyline and contributing to a cool embrace, with temperatures hovering around 57 degrees. The west winds carry a briskness, stirring the heart of the city as they dance between buildings, a prelude to the warmth the day may bring.\n\nBy midday, the forecast promises an awakening; the clouds will yield to bright, welcoming sunshine that illuminates the iconic skyline. As the sun carves its path through the clouds, expect temperatures to peak around the mid-60s, making it a delightful day to explore. Though the chances of drizzle remain low, the lingering marine layer may keep the air cool and crisp, especially near the bay. Dress comfortably in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket to fend off the morning chill, transitioning easily to an open collar in the afternoon warmth. As the city breathes in this fresh, cornflower blue afternoon, one might relish the simple joy of a stroll through Golden Gate Park or enjoy a cup of coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, soaking in the vibrant life that ebbs and flows through the heart of Downtown San Francisco.",
