    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this San Francisco morning, the atmosphere carries a gentle coolness, with the sun breaking through the clouds, offering a tantalizing glimpse of a partly sunny day ahead. The city lies beneath a high veil of muted gray, reminiscent of the calm before a gentle transition. As the hours progress, expect the temperatures to embrace the mid-60s, ushering in a comfortable warmth that dances delicately with the brisk winds sweeping in from the west. These winds, spirited and free, whisper through the streets at 13 to 24 mph, occasionally gusting up to 30, lending a dynamic quality to the morning air.\n\nAlthough the day may remain predominantly clear, the evening presents a shift; clouds will deepen and the marine layer may inch back toward the shore, wrapping the city in whispers of fog come nighttime, as temperatures will drop to a soft 57 degrees. For the urban wanderer, dressing in layers stands out as the practical choice\u2014a light sweater or jacket against the brisk breeze during the day would be well advised, perhaps paired with comfortable footwear suited for an urban stroll. Consider visiting the quieter corners of the city, perhaps a locally favored caf\u00e9 to sip on a warm drink or perhaps a leisurely walk through one of the parks, enjoying the hidden details of early-morning life. As the sun sets, a cozy gathering with friends indoors could become the perfect way to wind down, embracing the shimmering glow of the city that embodies the spirit of coastal allure.",
