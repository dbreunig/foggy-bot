    "weather_report": "As night embraces Downtown San Francisco, the sky wears a cloak of clouds, a gentle gray hue signaling the soft approach of cooler temperatures. Tonight's low will settle around a comfortable 55 degrees, with a westerly breeze whispering through the streets, gusting lightly at times. This subdued atmosphere invites a certain coziness, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet cup of tea at a local cafe as the evening deepens.\n\nOn Sunday, the forecast hints at a brightening day, giving promise to those who seek solace in the sun's warm embrace. Morning's veil of clouds will give way to mostly sunny skies, with the afternoon bringing a delightful decline in temperature to around 62, allowing for a more refreshing experience. It is the kind of day where a light jacket would serve well\u2014enough to ward off the subtle bite of wind yet not too cumbersome. Such weather beckons urban explorers to venture into the vibrant neighborhoods, perhaps to wander through the colorful markets or indulge in a leisurely brunch at one of the many charming eateries. With wind conditions remaining steady, it\u2019s advisable to secure hats and sunglasses as you take in the breathtaking views that only this city can provide.",
