The clouds hang serenely overhead, a canvas of muted gray against the fading light, while a mild west-southwest breeze whispers through the streets. As night deepens, the fog may waver in and out, a signature of the Bay that offers both mystery and comfort\u2014a reminder of the maritime embrace this city knows so well.\n\nAs Monday unfolds, one might anticipate the sun peeking through wisps of cloud, introducing a slight chance of rain later in the afternoon. Expect a high reaching around 70 before a subtle descent to a cooler embrace as the day winds down. The winds, stronger at times, will stir the leaves, coaxing the vibrant energy of the city into life. For those stepping out, a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the fickle chill, perfect for enjoying a stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many parks. It\u2019s a day that invites you to meander through the local caf\u00e9s, perhaps indulging in a warm cup of coffee while watching the world drift by, draped in the unique charm of San Francisco\u2019s ever-shifting skies.",
