As the sun climbs higher, casting its golden glow across the skyline, the air remains cool yet inviting, with temperatures nudging towards a mild 64 degrees before gradually dipping as the day unfolds\u2014a tender reminder of the city's capricious climate. \n\nHowever, as twilight approaches, whispers of a slight chance of drizzle may grace the evening, cloaking the city in a soft veil of mist, a hallmark of its coastal charm. The low will settle around a comfortable 50 degrees, nudging passersby to wrap in light layers for the night ahead. Today beckons for a stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps an outdoor coffee to savor the moment, as the light dances off the waves. But as dusk beckons, embrace a cozy corner of your favorite caf\u00e9, watching the ebb and flow of life as the clouds begin to roll in, softly reminding all of the ever-present marine layer just beyond.",
