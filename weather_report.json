    "weather_report": "The air over Downtown San Francisco presents a delightful tableau this evening, a scene free of fog's lingering embrace. With the sun painting the sky in vibrant hues, clarity reigns supreme, offering an unobstructed view toward the Golden Gate and the rolling hills beyond. Soft, gentle breezes from the west add a refreshing touch, inviting one to bask in the mildness of the night, as temperatures dip comfortably. \n\nAs Sunday unfolds, the forecast speaks of continued sunshine, though the afternoon will coax temperatures to gracefully slide downward. It\u2019s an ideal moment for a leisurely stroll through the city's hilly streets or perhaps a gathering with friends in one of its many outdoor caf\u00e9s. A light jacket may provide solace as the remnants of the day\u2019s warmth fade, while casual attire will suit the sunny, pleasant weather. Tonight's allure lies in the city's charm, perfect for quiet reflections or shared laughter under a clear canopy, as the Bay whispers its timeless secrets.",
