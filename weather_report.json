    "weather_report": "As midday graces Downtown San Francisco, the sun casts its warm glow, illuminating the city with a cheerful clarity that contrasts beautifully against the backdrop of rolling hills and vibrant architecture. With temperatures flirting around a comfortable 63 degrees, the breeze whispers softly through the streets, carrying the scent of freshly brewed coffee and pastries from nearby caf\u00e9s. This afternoon promises to hold onto that sunny charm, albeit with a gentle dip toward the early evening as temperatures ease down to around 61. \n\nAs twilight approaches, the skies might attire themselves in a veil of soft clouds, beckoning a slight chance of drizzle after dawn's first light. However, for now, the prevailing winds, ranging from a light touch at 6 mph to a brisk 14 mph, ruffle the leaves of golden trees lining the boulevards, only hinting at the marine layer lurking just out of sight. To embrace the day comfortably, light layers and a breezy outer garment will serve well against the shifting winds and sudden shivers of evening. With such pleasant conditions, a leisurely stroll through the charming streets or a visit to a local gallery could prove delightful, unfolding layers of treasure found in this urban landscape alive with creativity and charm.",
