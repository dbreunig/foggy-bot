    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a subtle tranquility envelops the city. Cloud cover dominates the skyline, casting a soft, muted light that hints at the coastal drizzle predicted to creep in after nightfall. The air carries a fresh chill, reminiscent of ocean mist, promising a low of around 56 degrees that will feel particularly brisk against the skin as the southwest winds dance lightly at 9 to 14 mph. Expect a whisper of surf in the background, a reminder of the nearby Bay, especially as the night deepens and fatigue stirs the promise of cozy indoors.\n\nTomorrow greets the city with optimism; a mostly sunny embrace invites exploration and leisure. The high will hover near 62, a welcome warmth that suggests layering might be wise for those venturing out. Prepare for the playful gusts, potentially reaching 22 mph, and consider a light jacket or cardigan, especially in shaded nooks and crannies where the fog stubbornly lingers. The day is perfect for a stroll through the parks or savoring a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, perhaps with a warm drink in hand, while you catch up with old friends or simply bask in the calming ambiance of the city. While iconic attractions beckon, this is a day that whispers to the soul to slow down and enjoy the simple pleasures.",
