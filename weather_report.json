As the sun ascends and scatters the veil of clouds, one's gaze will be met with a clear and inviting blue, a rare hue in this fog-kissed coastal town.\n\nAs the morning progresses, the chance of drizzling diminishes, yielding to sunshine gracing the day with warmth. By afternoon, temperatures are expected to linger near the mid-sixties, perfect for an outing\u2014the embrace of the sun will feel invigorating yet tempered by that familiar San Francisco breeze. The marine layer may still flirt with the edges of the city, hinting at the coastal mystique that shrouds the Golden Gate. For those stepping out, a light layer would suffice\u2014a sweater or a casual jacket worn over a comfortable shirt will harmonize with the shifting temperatures. This is a day to wander through the streets, perhaps exploring quiet corners of a nearby park or savoring coffee at a local caf\u00e9, allowing the day\u2019s serenity to unfold at its own gentle pace.",
