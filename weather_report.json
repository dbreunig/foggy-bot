    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, the lingering hints of drizzle dance through the air, kissed by a gentle breeze from the west-southwest. As the temperature settles into the mild embrace of the low fifties, there's a soothing quality to the coolness that suggests snuggling into a light jacket or a cozy sweater. Patchy clouds drift thoughtfully across the night sky, softening the moonlight and setting a tranquil scene for an evening stroll or a quiet moment at your favorite caf\u00e9, perhaps treating yourself to some warm brew.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the morning may arrive with traces of drizzle, but the sun will soon stretch across the horizon, unveiling a mostly sunny backdrop framed by the gentle gusts that speak of autumn's awakening. As the day warms, the high will hover around a comfortable sixty-seven, an invitation for casual explorations through nearby parks or leisurely visits to art galleries. With the breeze picking up, donning layers will serve well, allowing for adaptability between warmth and coolness as the day progresses. Whether you're planning on a simple walk along the waterfront or searching for hidden gems in local boutiques, the day promises a blend of clarity and comfort over the city's enchanting landscape.",
