    "weather_report": "The dawn breaks gently over Downtown San Francisco, cloaked in a hush that hints at a lovely day ahead. As the low pressure retreats, leaving behind cool whispers through the air, one can sense a clarity emerging from the night. The low temperature rests around 51, a soft invitation to bundle in a light sweater or jacket before stepping out. This morning, the sky remains mostly clear, a delicate canvas awaiting the brush of the sun.\n\nBy midday, the sun will ascend in full vigor, promising to warm the city to a pleasant 66 degrees. A light west wind stirs, providing just enough movement to feel refreshing and invigorating against the skin. Today holds the potential for vibrant excursions; a stroll along the Embarcadero could invite the delight of fresh seafood, perhaps accompanied by the distant sound of the sea lapping against the shores. Alternatively, a quiet moment sipping coffee at a window seat may provide an intimate glimpse of the city awakening from its slumber. While the marine layer may still be lurking in the more coastal nooks, the heart of the city reflects an optimistic spirit, perfect for those seeking modest pleasures under the soft embrace of a San Francisco sun.",
