As dawn approaches, expect the fog to retreat, yielding to the sun\u2019s warm embrace. \n\nSaturday unfolds with a promise of vibrant clarity. By the midday sun, the city will bask in its typical, albeit crisp, winter glow, a high around 60 to warm the spirits and inspire strolls through the quieter streets. With a light northeast wind swirling around 3 to 12 mph, the day invites layers: a light jacket perhaps, paired with comfortable shoes, perfect for wandering through nearby parks or enjoying a coffee at a local caf\u00e9. As afternoon arrives and temperatures ease back to around 58, consider a slow walk to admire the enduring spirit of this beloved city\u2014its unique mix of history and modernity dancing gently in the daylight. On days like this, the ordinary becomes extraordinary, beckoning you to enjoy life\u2019s simple pleasures under the watchful eye of the golden sun.",
