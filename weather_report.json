    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, this afternoon unfolds beneath the embrace of a radiant sun, casting its warm light over the city with highs nudging toward 61 degrees. The gentle west winds, whispering between the buildings, bring a refreshing touch while the temperatures transition, falling softly to around 59 by mid-afternoon. A sky of soft blue invites one outdoors, and it is likely that the day is as clear as a polished lens. Gone are the fog's lingering traces, allowing for unobstructed views of iconic structures reaching towards the heavens.\n\nAs night approaches, tranquility sets in with a promise of mostly clear skies and a low of 46 degrees. A light southwest wind provides a comforting caress in the evening air, making the atmosphere feel snug yet invigorating. Dress in layers, perhaps donning a light jacket to ward off the chill when the sun dips beyond the horizon. This serene day paints a perfect backdrop for a leisurely stroll through the park, a calming visit to a local caf\u00e9, or a quiet moment spent observing the city\u2019s vibrancy juxtaposed against the vast bay\u2014activities that suit the rhythm of an afternoon sliding gently into evening.",
