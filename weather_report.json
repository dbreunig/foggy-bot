    "weather_report": "As dusk gently blankets Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere remains pleasantly mild, with a gentle breeze rustling through the streets. Tonight's sky is partly veiled by clouds, but the warmth of the day lingers, dipping only to the low 50s. The southwest wind whispers softly, adding an invitation to take a stroll through the illuminated cityscape. The low-hanging sun casts a golden hue, illuminating the iconic skyline while leaving the Golden Gate Bridge standing as a majestic sentinel amidst the evening's embrace.\n\nAs Friday unfurls its sunny disposition, expect the temperatures to reach the mid-60s, offering a splendid day for outdoor pursuits. Clarity prevails over the horizon, with the marine layer holding its distance\u2014present but not dominating the vista. There is no thick fog to shroud the landmarks, and the inviting scenery hints at leisurely explorations. For comfortable outings, consider layered clothing\u2014a light jacket for the cooler evening air combined with a relaxed shirt or sweater during the day. A walk through the bustling Ferry Building Marketplace, followed by a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9 overlooking the bay, promises a gratifying way to delight in the vibrant life of the city.",
