    "weather_report": "As the early hours embrace Downtown San Francisco, the city is wrapped in a gentle veil of partial cloudiness that hints at a tranquil night ahead. Toasted by a whispering west wind, temperatures hold steady around a comfortable 55 degrees. The awakening sun promises a gracious return of warmth tomorrow, nudging the mercury to a high near 65, before retreating to a more tempered 62 by afternoon. For those who venture out into the dawn, a light jacket will serve well against the cool tendrils of the breeze mingling with the crisp air.\n\nAs daylight breaks, it invites contemplation beneath the ever-shifting sky. The horizon suggests an elusive dance with fog; the Golden Gate might play hide-and-seek with wisps of marine layer, hinting at the city's true Pacific watercolor palette. Such a morning is best suited for quiet reflections or a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the rhythm of the bay melds seamlessly with thoughts unfurling like sails in the wind. At this hour, the streets wait, promising modest pleasures\u2014perhaps wandering through a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a brew that warms the soul, or pausing at a market where the colors of the season shine brightly in the eye of the beholder.",
