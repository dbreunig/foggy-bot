    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere retains a mild crispness, with the sunset casting a gentle hue across the city\u2019s silhouette. The air feels cool, resting at the edge of chill, hinting at a low of around 47 degrees. The expected clarity, tempered by a gentle breeze, suggests a night less burdened by fog than often characteristic of this coastline \u2014 although the marine layer lurks close, waiting to weave its way into the horizon's fold.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the prospects enhance as the sun rises, promising a day draped in an inviting warmth. Mostly sunny spells will blanket the city, a high near 63 degrees beckoning the residents outdoors, though the afternoon might coax temperatures to ease slightly. Dressed in layers, one might find comfort in a light sweater coupled with long sleeves. With such favorable weather, simple pleasures abound; consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet visit to one of the many cherished local parks, where the fragrance of blooming flowers fills the air and the laughter of children serves as a gentle soundtrack.",
