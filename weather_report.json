    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a quilt of clouds drapes the city, whispering a gentle promise of coolness. With the temperature easing to around fifty-two, the air feels crisp yet inviting. A delicate wisp of wind lingers from the west-southwest, barely nudging the branches, creating an ambiance perfect for tranquil hours spent indoors or a leisurely stroll along the sidewalks, where the city lights twinkle like scattered gems across a vast canvas.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the morning brings a soft embrace of partly sunny skies, ushering in a high near sixty-five. There's a sense of movement in the atmosphere, a subtle shift from the comfortable, cloudy evening into a day where clouds will often part to reveal a sunlit backdrop, though as the afternoon meanders in, temperatures will gently descend to around sixty-one. Those planning their outing might consider lightweight layers, perfect for adjusting as warmth and coolness dance between the sun and the lingering marine layer, sometimes stretching along the coast and casting a mystical veil over the Golden Gate Bridge. One might find joy in a leisurely coffee session at a local caf\u00e9, or perhaps a visit to one of the nearby parks to savor the fading light, all while donning a cozy sweater against the mild breeze of this enchanting coastal enclave.",
