    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a mix of sunshine peeking through the clouds, albeit tempered by a cool breeze that sweeps in from the west. Highs today hover around a brisk 60 degrees, creating a setting that feels refreshingly crisp against the backdrop of a cityscape softened by light clouds. The sporadic sun breaks through, illuminating the streets and inviting passersby to engage with the world outside\u2014even as a light marine layer looms, keeping a gentle shroud over certain parts of the bay.\n\nAs dusk approaches, an anticipated shift will give rise to mostly cloudy skies, with evening temperatures dipping to about 52 degrees. The southwest winds will carry the promise of a night that feels cool, perhaps prompting a layer or two for those out enjoying the twinkling lights of the city. A light jacket will serve well, perfect for a leisurely walk along the waterfront or an understated evening cafe visit, where the ambiance swells with soft chatter and the clinking of cups. Today is best suited for simple pleasures that allow you to savor the dynamic urban environment while mindful of the gentle chill in the air.",
