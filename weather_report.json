    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is wrapped in a gentle embrace of partial cloudiness, with temperatures dipping gracefully to around 49 degrees. A light breeze from the west-northwest stirs the air at a leisurely pace, whispering promises of a cool evening ahead. As the city rests, the remnants of the day dissolve into a tranquil night, hinting at the pleasant serenity that often blankets the Bay Area after dusk.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, there is a whisper of rain anticipated later in the day. The morning unfolds with the promise of sunshine, but as evening approaches, clouds may gather, bringing a mere chance of wetness that holds a modest possibility of 20%. The high will hover around 58 degrees, gradually cooling as afternoon wanes. Dress comfortably, with layers that invite warmth when the sun is out but ready to shield against the evening chill. Amidst this backdrop, consider a leisurely stroll through one of the many parks, or perhaps a visit to an intimate caf\u00e9 where one can sip a warm drink, embracing the seasonal transition. The day holds promise, tempered by the realities of coastal weather, but rewards those who seek simplicity in its nuances.",
