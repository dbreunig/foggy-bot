    "weather_report": "In the gentle cloak of the early morning hours, muted drizzle dances upon the pavement of Downtown San Francisco, softly kissing the air and weaving a sense of tranquility through the city. As darkness lingers, the city has a vague sheen, an almost dreamlike quality that invites reflection. There\u2019s a certain calmness in the cool breeze whispering through the streets, carrying with it the faint scent of saltwater from the bay. The forecast promises a gradual shift as the sun stretches awake, casting a soft glow that may break through the clouds by midday, though patches of gray may still roam the skyline, hinting at a day that is conflicted yet beautiful.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect a high around 64, tempered by a crispness in the air. The westward winds will playfully elevate the mood, allowing moments of warmth to spill over with the sun peeking through the clouds. The morning\u2019s drizzle fades into wisps of sunshine, encouraging a blend of light layers; a comfortable sweater paired with a breathable shirt will provide the perfect balance for wandering cafes, discovering hidden bookstores, or strolling along the Embarcadero as the day blooms toward afternoon. Today is one of those rare moments when San Francisco wears its marine layer like a delicate shawl, tempting the curious to explore its fog-draped beauty while remaining comfortably sheltered in the embrace of the city\u2019s charm.",
