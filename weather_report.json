    "weather_report": "As the early hours of dawn embrace Downtown San Francisco, the air is tinged with moisture, hinting at a gentle drizzle that may linger briefly before retreating. The sky hangs heavy with clouds, shrouding the city in a muted gray, yet beyond this veil, a promise of warmth stirs for later in the day. With temperatures poised to rise towards the mid-sixties, and the wind whispering through the streets at a brisk pace, it feels both invigorating and refreshing, a delightful reminder of the ocean\u2019s embrace. \n\nAs the sun unfurls its rays, the clouds will begin to part, unveiling a mostly sunny canvas that will encourage lingering outdoor pursuits. Although the morning may be obscured, it will not last long; by midday, the city will breathe a sigh of relief and come alive under its warming glow. One might consider donning layers that can be shed as the sun reaches its peak, perhaps a light sweater over a breathable shirt, complemented by comfortable shoes for wandering along the waterfront or exploring the nooks of your favorite neighborhood. The weather beckons for leisurely strolls, perhaps an indulgent coffee or a quiet moment in a sun-drenched park, soaking in the tranquility that accompanies this awakening of the day.",
