    "weather_report": "As the city begins to stir from slumber, a gentle blanket of clouds lingers over Downtown San Francisco, embodying the serene beauty of a spring night. The air is refreshingly crisp, with whispers of a southwest wind nudging softly through the streets. Although partly cloudy now, the promise of a brighter morning lies ahead with the sun set to rise into a mostly sunny sky as the day unfolds. Expect the warmth to creep near the mid-60s, though it will flirt with cooler tones in the afternoon as temperatures dip toward the low 60s.\n\nThe marine layer may still shroud certain pockets, particularly along the coast, creating a mysterious sense that whispers of the ocean\u2019s embrace are ever-present. Yet, for those yearning for activity, the day invites exploration. A gentle jacket would be advisable in the morning chill, while layers make for an adaptable attire as the sun attempts to coax dance through the clouds. Perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, or a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, a book in hand, would suit perfectly. Today calls for subtle delights, as the city awakens under a tender sun ready to brighten its storied streets.",
