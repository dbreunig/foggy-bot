    "weather_report": "The scene in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a mostly sunny sky, with a gentle warmth lingering in the air that hints at a pleasant afternoon to come. The temperature floats around a comfortable 70 degrees, while a mild breeze dances through the streets, stirring the city\u2019s energy. As the day progresses, expect a slight dip\u2014down to about 68 with the sunlight gradually retreating into the embrace of the evening clouds. \n\nTonight, a blanket of mostly gray clouds will settle overhead, curling in with a nocturnal hush and bringing the temperature down to a cozy 58. There\u2019s an easy-to-miss hint of fog tracing the edges of the city, the faintest sign of the marine layer that will whisper along the coast as the night deepens. Given this lovely yet uncertain warmth, dressing in layers is wise; a light sweater or perhaps a chic jacket will serve you well as you wander the streets, whether you're perusing a quiet bookstore or enjoying a bite at a local caf\u00e9. This afternoon invites exploration, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the city\u2019s many parks, where the balmy breeze and the sound of the waves can harmonize with the hum of the day.",
