    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks softly over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle residual coolness lingers in the air, hinting at the night's lingering embrace. The skies above are partially veiled with a delicate haze, a sign of the marine layer that has not yet fully retreated, allowing for a muted glow as the sun stretches its rays toward the horizon. With temperatures poised to rise modestly into the low to mid-60s, it promises a day where sunshine will gradually replace the shadows of night, creating a canvas of warmth and light.\n\nGiven the conditions, this morning beckons for a leisurely start with light layers to navigate the coolness, perhaps a soft sweater or a light jacket that can be shed as the day warms. As the sky clears and the sun establishes itself, a stroll along the waterfront or a quiet sit in one of the city\u2019s many parks could prove quite enjoyable. Plan for a midday escape, possibly wandering into a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or exploring an interesting exhibit at a nearby gallery, as the wind swells to 20 mph, whispering the excitement of summer\u2019s approach. The phenomena of San Francisco's weather invites simple pleasures today, urging all to savor the gentle transition from night to day while the city awakens.",
