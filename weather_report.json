    "weather_report": "Tonight's air in Downtown San Francisco carries a gentle whisper of coolness, with partly cloudy skies inviting a soothing embrace around the low of 56. The west-southwest breeze, weaving through the streets, adds an invigorating touch, flowing at modest speeds of up to 10 mph\u2014just enough to ruffle the pages of an open book or send a wayward leaf dancing across the ground.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Sunday, prepare for a shift that offers a warm embrace, promising sunny delight and a high around 65. The morning light will reveal a transformed cityscape, with the west-southwest winds picking up to 17 mph, casting a refreshing chill but not an unwelcome one. Though the sun seeks to break through, it\u2019s worth noting that remnants of the marine layer linger in the air, hinting at fog in the distance that may still caress the Golden Gate with a soft, ghostly touch.\n\nDressing for this weather invites you to layer comfortably; perhaps a light jacket for the evening, giving way to a casual tee or blouse beneath the afternoon sun. In this pleasant climate, the day calls out for simple pleasures: a leisurely stroll along the waterfront as the sun rises overhead, sampling local pastries outdoors, or perhaps visiting one of the city\u2019s many tranquil parks for a moment of reflection amidst the green. As the winds play and the sun shines, it is a time to enjoy all that your city has to offer, embracing both the cool and the warmth that define this beautiful slice of San Francisco.",
