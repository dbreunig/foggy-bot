    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a blanket of vivid sunshine, tempered by the cool caress of a westerly breeze. The temperature dances around a pleasant 65 degrees, offering an inviting vista for those who choose to wander the city's vibrant streets. However, as the afternoon wanes, a gentle descent into the evening chill will take hold, bringing temperatures closer to 62. Here, one might glimpse hints of the iconic fog that whispers along the coast, often foreshadowing a near-enveloping marine layer that could drift in as night falls.\n\nAs the clock nudges past ten in the evening, the clouds gather, revealing hints of patchy drizzle after the early hours. The forecast suggests a quieter scene, cloaked in a mostly cloudy sky with a low around 55. One may wish to don a light jacket or a long-sleeved shirt, a comfort against the cool breeze that wafts through the streets. The quiet roads beckon for leisurely strolls among the city's myriad corners, perhaps exploring a nearby caf\u00e9 for warmth or finding solace in a local bookstore. With the night softly unfurling, it's a perfect time to enjoy the shifting shadows of the city, perhaps with a good book in hand or over quiet conversations with friends, as the day melts into a tranquil evening.",
