    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over Downtown San Francisco, the day begins clear, with only a hint of the typical coastal fog lingering in the distance. Bright rays cascade down, painting the landscape in warm hues while the ocean breeze carries a refreshing chill. With temperatures poised to hover around a comfortable 63, expect a gradual descent into the mid-60s as the afternoon unfolds, complemented by a playful southwest wind dancing at about 8 to 22 mph. The currents will perhaps offer a sense of vibrancy; indeed, a perfect excuse to take a stroll along the waterfront or perhaps indulge in a leisurely breakfast at your favorite caf\u00e9.\n\nTonight, the sky will embrace a more subdued palette with partly cloudy moments and a gentle low creeping to around 51. The idyllic conditions call for layers, suggesting a light sweater or jacket would complement your afternoon attire. With such clarity in the air, it may be the ideal evening to venture out, whether to admire the star-speckled sky or to join friends for a cozy gathering. Explore, breathe it all in; today is a gentle reminder of all the simple pleasures that our city weaves together.",
