    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the early morning, a gentle veil of patchy fog wraps itself around the edges of Downtown San Francisco, hinting at the softer rhythms of the day yet to unfold. Beneath this transient mist, the city slumbers peacefully, with temperatures lingering near a cool 49 degrees. As the sun gradually rises and awakens the skyline, the fog's grip will loosen, yielding to a sun-drenched afternoon where the high climbs near 66. While the fog may cling stubbornly before 9 a.m., the promise of blue skies and warmth emerges with a light south-southwest breeze whispering through the buildings.\n\nConsider layering your attire thoughtfully; a light jacket will provide comfort against the morning chill but can be shed to revel in the embrace of the sun's rays by midday. This is a day suited for leisurely strolls along the waterfront, perhaps a visit to the local cafes where the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air. Alternatively, the city's parks await with open arms, inviting you to bask in the mild climate, perhaps with a book or in the company of friends, as San Francisco presents a canvas of warmth and vitality after the fog departs. Delight in the splendid day ahead, where the city's character shines ever so brightly.",
