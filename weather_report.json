    "weather_report": "As evening descends over Downtown San Francisco, a soft blanket of clouds veils the city, lending an air of mystery to the familiar skyline. The lingering chill whispers promises of rain, with a subtle breeze rustling through the streets. The forecast hints at scattered showers late tonight, so a light jacket will serve well for those wandering outside. Temperatures hover around a chill-inducing fifty degrees, urging one to embrace layers rather than risk the cold.\n\nWednesday greets you with a similar mood, as rain remains a possibility even amidst fleeting moments of sunshine. The air will carry a refreshing bite, with high temperatures struggling to reach fifty-seven before a gentle descent in the afternoon. It\u2019s a day best suited for leisurely pursuits, perhaps a stroll through a cozy gallery or an immersive visit to a local bookstore, where the scent of coffee mingles with the rustle of pages. Bring along that ever-reliable umbrella as you navigate the whims of the weather, allowing the city\u2019s charm to embrace you fully, even in this somewhat overcast chapter.",
