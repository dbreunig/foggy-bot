    "weather_report": "As the night cloaks Downtown San Francisco, the city settles into a tranquil state, the air cool and crisp with hints of salt drifting from the bay. The sky is partly shrouded in clouds, allowing a soft glow from the moon to peek through, casting a serene light over the urban landscape. A gentle breeze whispers through the streets, carrying the fresh scent of sea air mixed with the earthy tones of the city. Overnight temperatures will linger near a comfortable 53 degrees, encouraging a light jacket or sweater for those wandering outside in the stillness. \n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, the dawn promises clarity, as the sun will rise to grace the city with warmth, reaching toward a high of 65 degrees. The winds from the west will dance through the avenues, a bit stronger than the night, but nothing intimidating. While the marine layer may be absent for the moment, it\u2019s wise to be prepared for its potential return, lingering just offshore, ready to roll in as the day matures. The light and playful breezes are perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where you might find comfort in a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a warm pastry and a vibrant cup of coffee while watching the world awaken.",
