    "weather_report": "As dawn peeks softly over San Francisco, the city finds itself enveloped in the faintest caress of a marine layer that gently hugs the hills. A delicate tapestry of clouds dances above, but the evening chill is already giving way to the promise of a bright Friday. The air is crisp, fresh with that unique blend of salty sea and urban vitality, invigorating anyone brave enough to step outside.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect a sun-soaked afternoon, radiating warmth that flirts with 72 degrees before subtly drifting down to a more temperate 70. A gentle southwest breeze will accompany the sun, providing a refreshing relief as it whispers through the streets and parks. Given the clarity anticipated, this morning's light fog will likely lift, revealing the storied beauty of the Golden Gate and the undulating cityscape. For those contemplating a stroll or perhaps a soft morning jog, consider a light layer\u2014something to keep the remnants of coolness at bay while allowing the sun's rays to lend their embrace.\n\nWith such lovely weather, it\u2019s an ideal day to embrace the urban landscape; perhaps wander through Golden Gate Park, coffee in hand, or take your time exploring the charming side streets of the Mission District. Whether you're leaning into leisure or activity, today offers the perfect blend of vibrancy and calm.",
