    "weather_report": "In the stillness of early morning, the air holds a quiet promise of clarity, unmarred by the coastal fog that often shrouds this vibrant city. Overnight, San Francisco has settled into a crisp tranquility, the temperature draping a soft chill around 45 degrees, a gentle invitation for a light jacket or perhaps a cozy sweater to ward off the lingering night air. As dawn begins to unfold, Friday welcomes the sun with open arms, illuminating the horizon and painting the city in warm hues. By midday, expect a high near 60, although the temperatures may ebb toward a cool 58 as the afternoon draws near, all while a mild northwest wind whispers through the streets at a leisurely pace.\n\nThe charm of the day lingers in its pleasant quietude; it seems an opportune moment to take a stroll along the waterfront or meander through Golden Gate Park, where spring blooms unfurl in subtle bursts of color amidst the greenery. Perhaps venture to a quaint caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with warm pastries, perfect companions for a contemplative morning. In this embrace of clarity and comfort, one can find joy in the little things\u2014whether it's a simple walk, indulging in a favorite read, or savoring the sweetness of the day.",
