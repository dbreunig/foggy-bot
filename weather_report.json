    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is painted in hues of blue and gold as the sun manages to peek through, casting a soft glow over the iconic skyline. The high temperature dances around 65, with a gentle dip to about 63 as the day slouches toward evening. A lively west-southwest breeze swirls through, whispering at 23 mph, with gusts that add an exhilarating touch, reminiscent of the coast\u2019s wild spirit. The warmth embraces you, yet the wind hints at the familiar chill of the ocean\u2019s nearby embrace, reminding us that summer in the city is often as capricious as it is charming.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect a shroud of clouds to weave in, settling into a low near 57. The winds will slow, though the occasional gust remains a lively companion. While today presents a relatively clear and lovely urban panorama, hints of fog may still linger, primarily hovering over the waters, playing hide and seek with the Golden Gate. It would be wise to don layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a jacket, ideal for both the warmth of the afternoon and the cool breeze that follows as night descends. A stroll to the waterfront could be particularly invigorating, where you can savor the vibrant energy of the city while glancing at the bay\u2019s ever-changing moods.",
