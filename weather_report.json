    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the remnants of night still cling to the air, enveloping the city in a gentle cloak of moisture. The forecast hints that this embrace of clouds will soon give way to splashes of sunshine. Today promises a sun-filled interlude where the crisp, coastal breeze will dance through the streets, refreshing but light, with a touch of westward enthusiasm. Expect a high around 63, slightly tempered by the afternoon\u2019s subtle decline to a cooler 61, as if the city is reflecting on the early warmth of spring.\n\nThe marine layer, a quintessential companion to San Francisco mornings, lingers just enough to savor the allure of misty silhouettes. It\u2019s not so thick as to obscure the iconic views but provides a soft focus that defines the city's unique charm. One might wish to embrace layers today; a light jacket or sweater over a simple shirt will balance the coolness that can sweep in unexpectedly. Dressing in comfortable, breathable fabrics will invite ease as you engage with the world, whether it leads you to local coffee spots for a quiet morning brew or a leisurely stroll through one of the neighborhood parks\u2014perhaps even an unhurried visit to an art gallery or a quiet nook to read. Today\u2019s pleasant clarity waits just beyond the dawn\u2019s lingering clouds, beckoning for you to step out and relish the unfolding day.",
