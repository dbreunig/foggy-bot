    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the afternoon unfolds under a bright, inviting sun, casting a warm glow across the cityscape. While the high temperature gracefully hovers around the mid-60s, the afternoon's gentle descent brings a playful chill. The winds, spirited from the west-southwest at about 24 miles per hour, whisk away any lingering clouds, leaving behind a canvas of blue with streaks of white. Yet, the horizon hints at a possible marine layer retreating to the distance, only intermittently kissing the coastal edges. \n\nAs evening draws near, expect a soft transition to partly cloudy skies, with temperatures settling comfortably in the mid-50s. For those venturing outdoors, a light jacket or a cozy sweater would suffice against the brisk breeze. The day invites leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the local parks, where you can sip a rich coffee and watch the city pulse with life. Embrace the beauty of a San Francisco day that whispers both clarity and comfort, a perfect blend for enjoying the unhurried essence of urban existence.",
