    "weather_report": "In the heart of San Francisco, the day is unfolding with a gentle presence, where sunlight breaks through the clouds, casting a warm glow over the city streets. The afternoon air hovers around a temperate 66 degrees, a welcoming embrace that invites a leisurely stroll along familiar avenues. As the breeze rustles through the leaves, whispering stories of the bay, you may notice the encroaching coolness that hints at the swift shift into evening. By nightfall, a shroud of clouds will wrap the city, possibly yielding a few light droplets of drizzle after the clock strikes eleven.\n\nFor those venturing out in this delightful afternoon, attire should include layers \u2014 a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the brisk wind that occasionally tugs playfully from the west. With the sun shining brightly, the world seems to come alive, and the allure of a quiet caf\u00e9 calls out, perfect for savoring a well-brewed cup of coffee while watching the city sway to its pulse. Alternatively, a trip to a local bookstore or an art gallery provides an oasis from life's hurried pace, allowing moments of reflection amid creativity. As the day fades slowly, the city\u2019s charm deepens, calling for thoughtful exploration before the cool fog rolls in, draping its soft, muted veil across the familiar skyline.",
