    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun greets the city, casting a warm glow across the streets of Downtown San Francisco. With a high near 75 degrees, there's a pleasant warmth tempered by a gentle north wind, rustling the leaves of the trees and drawing a hint of refreshing coolness into the atmosphere. Today, there is no sign of the haunting fog often associated with this coastal haven; the clarity feels almost like a rare gift, allowing one to gaze upon the cityscape and the distant hills without the veils that usually shroud them.\n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will remain mostly clear, inviting the soft embrace of twilight, with temperatures dipping to a comfortable 55 degrees. With a west-northwest breeze, the transitioning weather will feel refreshing against the skin. It\u2019s a day that beckons one to explore the urban landscape, perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or an intimate gathering in a nearby caf\u00e9, where the sweet smell of freshly brewed coffee mixes with laughter and conversation. For those out and about, lightweight layers are advisable; they will seamlessly adapt to the shifting temperatures as day yields to night, making for a tranquil end to a fine day in the city.",
