    "weather_report": "The skies above Downtown San Francisco are painted with a soft blue hue, embracing a day that feels comfortably warm yet distinctly coastal. As the morning unfolds, the temperature hovers around a pleasant 66 degrees, promising a gentle drop to around 64 by afternoon. The charming South Southwest breeze, whispering at 3 to 8 mph, carries with it the faint reminiscence of ocean waves, harmonizing beautifully with the setting. While the city enjoys sunshine, one cannot ignore the subtle hints of the marine layer lingering just beyond the Golden Gate, adding a delicate mystique to the edges of the landscape.\n\nTonight, the atmosphere will shift to a serene clarity, with temperatures dipping to a cozy 52 degrees. The gentle winds will ease further, fostering an inviting evening perfect for strolls along the waterfront or gathering with friends at a local caf\u00e9. Attire in light layers is recommended; a stylish cardigan or light jacket will suffice to prepare for the cool embrace of evening air. Consider leisurely activities, perhaps taking a moment to pause at a favorite park or indulging in conversation over artisanal coffee, allowing the beauty of the San Francisco day to culminate in tranquil evening reflections.",
