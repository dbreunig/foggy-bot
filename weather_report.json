    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, a gentle mist lingers just before midday, holding a soft, fleeting touch of drizzle in the air, teasing the morning with hints of moisture. The day is expected to carry a partially sunny canvas, only slightly cloaked by persistent clouds, as temperatures hover around the low sixties. A mild west-southwest wind dances quietly through the streets, occasionally stirring up gusts that remind one of the ever-changing nature of this coastal city. As the afternoon approaches, the warmth of the sun may feel fleeting as temperatures dip slightly, echoing the urban rhythm of highs and lows.\n\nAs evening descends, the clouds will thicken, cloaking the city in a comfortable embrace, with the temperature settling around the mid-fifties. A layered ensemble would be advisable today\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a comfortable sweater, allowing for the gentle chill that will accompany the coming night. There\u2019s a certain charm in such weather, inviting a stroll through the quirky neighborhoods or a quiet moment with a book at a local caf\u00e9, as the cloud-strewn sky transitions to twilight. Whether seeking a secluded park bench or savoring the bustle of an intimate gathering, today holds a promise of understated beauty in the heart of the city.",
