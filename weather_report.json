    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the air feels crisp and clear, a refreshing note to close the day. With a low temperature settling around 50 degrees, a gentle breeze from the south-southwest whispers through the streets, inviting warmth from soft layers. The city, adorned with its iconic architecture, radiates a tranquil charm under a mostly clear sky. \n\nAs dawn breaks on Sunday, expect the sun to rise in majestic glory, bathing the city in a golden hue. A high near 70 will tempt you outside, though the afternoon may usher in a subtle dip to around 68. As you make your plans for the day, think light yet practical; a light jacket or sweater will offer comfort against the light winds. Consider a stroll along the waterfront, perhaps visiting a quiet caf\u00e9 with a view, where the sound of waves and the scent of sea air create a perfect backdrop for a leisurely morning. Or meander through the hidden corners of Golden Gate Park, enjoying nature's quiet embrace as the sun dances above.",
