    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the morning greets us with a muted embrace, as low clouds drape the skyline, obscuring the usually vivid outlines of the Golden Gate and the neighboring hills. The air feels crisp and carries a gentle breeze from the west, painting a scene rich with the promise of a day that will gradually brighten. As the sun ascends, we may expect its warmth to gradually pierce through the cool marine layer, with temperatures nudging toward the cool side of comfort, reminding us to keep light layers close at hand.\n\nWhile this morning appears somewhat draped in gray, it doesn't detract from its charm. The soft hues of dawn beckon one to savor a slow start to the day\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll along Embarcadero, where the reflections of the city wane in the calm waters of the bay. With temperatures hovering around 58, a light jacket would be your companion, allowing for comfort whether you're inhaling the salty air or sipping coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9. Should you find yourself drawn outdoors, seize the opportunity to explore the quieter corners of the city, each nook breathing a sense of tranquility that only a fog-clad morning can provide. As the day unfolds, the clouds will retreat, but they will leave behind an ethereal beauty that lingers long after the sun makes its full ascent.",
