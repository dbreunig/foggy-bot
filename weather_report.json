    "weather_report": "As the sun dips low over Downtown San Francisco, the evening unfolds with a softness that belies the brisk air. Currently, the skies are largely clear, allowing the remnants of daylight to paint the horizon in gentle hues, while a light north-northwest breeze rustles through the city. With temperatures settling comfortably around 56 degrees, it feels pleasant yet cool enough to suggest that an additional layer is wise, particularly as the night deepens.\n\nTomorrow promises a delightful continuation of this serene spell, with the day anticipated to start brightly under mostly sunny skies. Expect temperatures to reach a pleasant warmth, peaking near 77 degrees by midday, before gradually drifting to around 74 in the afternoon. Dress in light layers to embrace the warmth while being prepared for the coolness when the north wind sweeps through later on. This is an ideal day for a leisurely stroll through the city\u2019s neighborhoods, perhaps exploring the artsy enclaves or the bustling markets, each infused with the vibrant spirit of the spring season. On such a day, the city feels alive, inviting both residents and visitors alike to lose themselves in the enchanting charm of San Francisco.",
