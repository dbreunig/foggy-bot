    "weather_report": "As twilight settles gently over Downtown San Francisco, the evening unfolds under a partly cloudy sky, with a balmy breeze brushing through the streets. The air carries the familiar scent of the bay, mingling with hints of salt and the promise of cooler temperatures that will glide in with the night \u2013 a low around 56 degrees, inviting layered clothing for those venturing outdoors. The wind, a lively companion, dances around 13 to 22 mph, sending gusts that whisper stories from the golden days of summer.\n\nOn Saturday, a vibrant sun will take center stage, illuminating the city beneath a canopy of blue. As it rises, expect warmth to wrap around you, peaking at almost a pleasant 67 degrees, followed by a soft decline in temperature as afternoon drifts toward evening. The same breeze will persist, with whispers flowing at speeds of up to 24 mph, spicing up the air as it carries remnants of marine fog. Should the iconic fog roll in from the ocean, it may gracefully swirl around the bridge, draping it in mystery while still allowing a view of the skyline. For those pondering the day\u2019s adventures, a stroll along the waterfront, or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many parks, promises to be fulfilling. As the sun warms your skin, think to dress comfortably\u2014light layers to adapt to both cooling breezes and mid-afternoon sun will serve you well, perfectly balancing the charm of this bustling metropolis under its ever-changing sky.",
