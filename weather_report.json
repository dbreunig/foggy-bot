    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a veil of cloudy skies, hinting at the chill that lingers in the air. The temperature hovers delicately around a brisk 51 degrees, complimented by a gentle southwest breeze that whispers through the streets. The afternoon promises a transition to a more cheerful disposition, as the clouds begin to part, paving the way for mostly sunny skies that will usher in warmer tones to a high of 62, though temperatures are expected to cool slightly as the day progresses. \n\nFor those considering a stroll through the bustling streets or perhaps a visit to one of the local parks, the attire of the day calls for layers\u2014a light jacket to fend off the lingering coolness of early morning, gradually shed as you bask in the afternoon sun. The fog may still cling to the outer edges of the Golden Gate Bridge, quietly illuminating the boundaries of the bay and casting a soft mystique over the landscape. Perfectly wrapped in this weather, you might indulge in a leisurely walk, feeling the rhythm of the city come alive\u2014a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of coffee or to the bookshop for a cozy read could suit the day beautifully.",
