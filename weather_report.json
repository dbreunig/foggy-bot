    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the night drapes itself gradually, tired yet reluctant to yield. The skies are adorned with a delicate patchwork of clouds, whispering the promise of calm. The air feels cool, settling in the low fifties, while gentle breezes from the southwest offer a soft embrace, a prelude to the pleasant day that unfolds ahead. By midday, the golden warmth of the sun will sweep across the city, nudging the thermometer to a comfortable sixty-seven, even as it pulls back to a gentler sixty-five in the afternoon. \n\nToday will feel splendidly inviting, as the sunshine bathes the iconic skyline, casting warm hues against the backdrop of the bay. While the marine layer may linger at the edges, veiling the bridges in a casual shroud, fog will play its coy game, retreating to the coasts by mid-morning. A light sweater or a light jacket should comfortably accompany you, shielding against any lingering chill while allowing for a carefree enjoyment of the day. For a leisurely outing, consider a visit to the Mission District for artisanal coffees or a tranquil stroll through the Presidio, where the landscape melds with the peaceful aroma of the ocean and earth. Embrace this splendid day, for it offers a rare blend of nature's artistry contrasted against the urban rhythm of the city.",
