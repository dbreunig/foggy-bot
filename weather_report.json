    "weather_report": "Morning breaks over Downtown San Francisco with a hint of autumn lingering in the air, yet today seems intent on offering a palate rather nostalgic for summer. The city awakens under a canopy of sunny skies, the high temperature poised to hover around a comfortable 61 degrees. A brisk west wind makes its presence known, inviting a playful dance of leaves along the streets, while it whispers tales of the Pacific across the land. Although the day begins clear, remnants of fog still linger at the edges of perception, clinging to the outstretched arms of the Golden Gate, teasing with the promise of a gentle marine layer that may embrace the coast later.\n\nAs evening approaches, the glow of clarity will turn to gentle twilight with a low temperature settling around 51 degrees, and the winds calming to weave a quieter narrative for the night ahead. If you find yourself roaming the streets, a light jacket is advisable\u2014one that rustles softly as you walk\u2014fit for an evening stroll to a favorite caf\u00e9, perhaps, or to catch an art exhibit quietly unfolding at a nearby gallery. The energy of the day merged with the promise of a warm night calls for simple pleasures: lingering conversations or a leisurely read in a park. Each moment a blend of light, air, and that unmistakable San Francisco spirit.",
