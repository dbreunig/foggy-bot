    "weather_report": "As night lingers, the air in Downtown San Francisco holds a touch of mystery, with a slight promise of drizzle that brushes against the city\u2019s skin, whispering of the coming day. Though the heavens are mostly cloaked in clouds, a gentle breeze from the west southwest murmurs through the streets, setting a tranquil backdrop for the evening. The temperature rests comfortably around 55, inviting a light jacket for those wandering out into the cool night air, as the insignificance of raindrops dances in the air at a modest chance.\n\nIn the morning, expect the subtle mist of drizzle to transition gracefully into a more promising outlook. Though the sun may take its time to rise, the forecast beckons a mostly sunny day, where temperatures will gradually rise, reaching their peak near 64 before gently sliding down to the comfy embrace of low 60s by afternoon. It would be wise to dress in layers, allowing the warmth of the day to meet the coolness that the shadows cast, perhaps a soft sweater or a flowy shirt that can be wrapped snugly against the body as the wind picks up. A leisurely stroll through one of the city\u2019s lush parks seems particularly enticing, where the coolness melds with the gentle warmth of the sun, offering the perfect canvas for a slow afternoon\u2014ideal for savoring a cup of coffee or simply indulging in the simple act of people-watching.",
