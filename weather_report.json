    "weather_report": "San Francisco greets you today with an inviting embrace of sunshine, casting an effervescent glow over the city. The air is crisp yet warm, hinting at a comfortable high that flirts with 70 degrees before cascading gently down to a mellow 66 in the afternoon. While the west-southwest winds whirl playfully around 13 to 21 miles per hour, the occasional gust dances in at a brisk 25 mph, offering a refreshing respite from the day's warmth. As you glance skyward, the cerulean heavens remain largely unblemished, with only the softest brush of clouds offering a subtle touch to this idyllic scene.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect the stars to emerge, complimented by a partly cloudy sky and a low temperature settling comfortably near 56 degrees. The same playful winds linger into the night, as nature's melody continues to serenade a city that never truly sleeps. This delightful weather invites you to revel in uncomplicated pleasures; perhaps a stroll through Golden Gate Park is in order, where the verdant landscapes and vibrant flora beckon your senses. Alternatively, a leisurely coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9 could provide a perfect canvas to absorb the soothing ambiance of the city in twilight. Dress in layers to accommodate both the daytime warmth and the cool evening breeze, ensuring you are ready for whatever the city's charms throw your way.",
