    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco basks in the warm embrace of a sunny Independence Day, the skies a brilliant blue that stretches endlessly. The air carries a gentle breeze from the west, embracing the city with playful gusts that occasionally swirl up to remind one of the ocean's proximity. With temperatures lingering around the low sixties, the atmosphere offers a comfortable invitation to embrace the day outside; however, as the afternoon wears on, the chill may creep in, particularly near the water. The marine layer, typically a character of these shores, has retreated for now, allowing the full splendor of the sun to dominate the scene and illuminate the iconic skyline with a clarity that is almost mesmerizing.\n\nAs evening draws near, the air will cool, urging the sunset's golden hues to compete with the daylight's brightness. Tonight's low will rest comfortably around fifty-two, suggesting that a light jacket or a cozy sweater should be on hand for those who plan to extend their revelry into the twilight. The weather beckons enthusiasts to stroll through the vibrant streets or perhaps savor a calm evening at a caf\u00e9, soaking in the ambiance with friends. There\u2019s a charm to the city as it transitions from day to night, and with such pleasant conditions, the possibilities are delightful and accessible.",
