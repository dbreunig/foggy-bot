    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a bright, clear sky, the sun casting a warm glow over the cityscape. The crispness of the air holds a promise that feels like spring, yet the day maintains that signature coolness characteristic of the Bay Area. As the afternoon sun reaches its peak, temperatures hover near sixty, complemented by a gentle southwest breeze that whispers through the streets, hinting at a lingering chill. While the forecast speaks of falling temperatures, there's a buoyant clarity to the day; the marine layer that often clings to the coast seems to have retreated, allowing unobstructed views of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and the vibrant skyline.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the evening will bring a soft transition into partly cloudy skies, perfect for a leisurely outing. With temperatures dipping to around forty-six, dressing in layers will be essential for comfort\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a sweater, ready to embrace the cooler air. Given these favorable conditions, one might find joy in a casual stroll along any of the city's scenic walkways, maybe sipping on a warm drink from a local caf\u00e9, or simply reveling in the charm of the neighborhood as it begins to light up for the night. Today is not just a day; it\u2019s an invitation to embrace the serenity that San Francisco offers in its quieter moments.",
