    "weather_report": "This morning in Downtown San Francisco unfolds with a serene clarity, the sun casting its gentle light over the city as it warms towards a high of 61 degrees. A brisk west-southwest wind dances through the streets, creating a pleasant rustle in the trees, stirring the vibrant life of the city. Though the day promises sunshine, there is an undercurrent of the marine layer lingering near the Golden Gate, lending a slight haze to the horizon that hints at the ethereal beauty unique to this coastal town. \n\nAs evening descends, expect the atmosphere to shift subtly, with partly cloudy skies blanketing the night, and temperatures dipping into a balmy low of 52. The southwest winds will persist, whispering softly against your skin, urging you to embrace the evening with layers. A light jacket made of breathable fabric paired with a comfy scarf should suffice, allowing you to enjoy an evening stroll along the Embarcadero or indulge in a quiet moment at a nearby caf\u00e9, savoring the warmth of a freshly brewed drink amidst the cool air. The day holds potential for simple pleasures, inviting you to explore the city\u2019s hidden gems, whether by wandering through the streets or retreating to a cozy nook as the sun sets behind the fog-kissed hills.",
