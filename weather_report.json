    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, the sky unfurls a tapestry of bright clarity, adorned with a sprinkling of stars as the city bathes in a refreshing coolness, settling around 51 degrees. The gentle westerly winds dance through the streets, whispering secrets of the ocean, invoking a certain vibrancy that hints at the warmth the day promises. Cradled in this fresh air, one might find joy in taking a leisurely stroll by the waterfront, perhaps with a knit sweater to ward off the evening chill, while the tantalizing aroma of food trucks wafts by.\n\nAs Friday dawns, anticipate a sun-soaked day where brightness reigns supreme. The air will warm to around 70, exhibited with casual elegance, allowing for moments of luxurious relaxation outdoors. Those venturing out should embrace comfortable attire, perhaps light layers that allow for a shift from blushing warmth to the gentler breezes by the bay. The day offers an ideal canvas for exploring local cafes, galleries, or even simply lingering at a sunlit park, watching the world unfold under the golden embrace of afternoon light. It beckons for the simple pleasures of life, inviting each individual to bask in its beauty.",
