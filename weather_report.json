    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle shroud of cloud begins to lift. The air feels cool, echoing whispers of the ocean, with a hint of noonday warmth set to emerge as the sun climbs higher in the sky. Presently, temperatures hover around a comforting low, with the prospect of a bright, sunny day ahead. By midday, the warmth will caress your skin, drifting softly between a high of 64 degrees and a cooler 62 as the afternoon unfolds, while a playful breeze teases from the west-southwest.\n\nWhile the fog may still cling to the edges of the bay, obscuring views at times, hints of sunlight challenge it to retreat. It is an ideal morning for a leisurely walk along the waterfront, where you might sip on a warm cup of coffee and watch the boats slip gracefully across the shimmering water. Dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater atop your favorite shirt\u2014saving a jacket for when the evening chill returns. Later, consider exploring the artsy enclaves of the Mission or the charming cafes of North Beach. The day promises clarity and delight, inviting you to embrace the rhythm of the city with open arms.",
