    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a canvas of mostly sunny skies, the city breathing in a refreshingly mild breeze. As the sun finds its place, the day\u2019s warmth nudges the temperature closer to 64, before settling gently around 62. The west-southwest wind sweeps down from the hills, adding a vigorous touch with gusts reaching up to 28 mph, enough to dance through the trees and tease at loose papers. Whether you\u2019re meandering through bustling streets or sipping a coffee outside, the clarity of the day invites one to revel in its bright embrace.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky holds on to its clarity, promising a mostly clear night ahead with temperatures dipping to a comfortable 53. The ongoing wind, although slightly softer, continues to carry an energizing spirit. For those planning their attire, layering remains a wise choice; a light jacket will serve well against the lingering coolness that can sneak up in these parts. The lush green spaces invite a leisurely stroll or perhaps a quiet moment with a book, while the lively caf\u00e9s teem with chatter and warmth. An evening of discovery awaits, whether through the taste of a new pastry or the company of friends, as the city whispers stories in the golden glow of the setting sun.",
