    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the night, Downtown San Francisco rests beneath a gentle blanket of stars, with the promise of a clear morning on the horizon. The low temperature around 50 degrees whispers of a crispness that invites an embrace of warmth, suggesting a light jacket or a cozy sweater might serve you well. As dawn breaks, expect the sun's golden rays to illuminate the city's iconic hills, transitioning from the cool night air to a pleasantly inviting day. A high near 70 dances teasingly with your senses, hinting at a subdued warmth that lingers without overwhelming.\n\nThe forecast paints a picture of a sunny Sunday as the marine layer remains at bay, allowing clarity to reign over the views of the Golden Gate and the sprawling urban landscape. With a light westerly breeze nudging through the streets, it is an ideal moment to step out into the world, perhaps seeking a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or meandering through one of the neighborhood parks, where blossoms burst forth in celebration of spring. The day calls for casual comfort; light layers will suit the shifting temperatures nicely, and a hat or sunblock may be prudent as the midday sun allows its presence to be felt before temperatures dip in the afternoon. Embrace the beauty of San Francisco on this splendid day, where the possibilities seem as broad and inviting as the clear blue skies above.",
