    "weather_report": "In the early hours of Wednesday, a gentle cloudiness cloaks Downtown San Francisco, wrapping the city in a temperate embrace. The air is mild, hovering comfortably around 57 degrees, with a brisk west-southwest wind teasing at about 12 to 15 mph. As dawn breaks, a certain clarity hints at the promise of a partly sunny day ahead. By afternoon, temperatures are expected to rise slightly, allowing the warmth of 65 degrees to brush against the urban landscape before cooling again.\n\nThe ever-present coastal influence may allow mist to linger along the waterfront, while the hills remain steadfast and resolute against the light marine layer. This fleeting fog offers a soft, almost poetic charm to the surroundings, enhancing the vibrant atmosphere that the city embodies. Attire should lean towards layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a flannel shirt complemented by windbreakers for those longing to stroll through the streets. A mid-morning excursion could be delightful\u2014a casual amble through local parks or quiet caf\u00e9s, indulging in freshly brewed coffee whilst watching the city awaken. The day urges exploration, infused with the kind of energy that invites every passerby to observe, breathe, and immerse in the unfolding tableau of San Francisco life.",
