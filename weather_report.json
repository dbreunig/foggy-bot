    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, a soft blanket of clouds embraces the city, enveloping it in a hazy hush that hints at the cool temperatures lingering just above 46 degrees. The northwesterly wind plays a gentle tune, whispering through the streets with a light touch, creating a serene atmosphere that beckons nighttime strolls under the flickering streetlights. The tranquility of the evening invites a certain coziness; perhaps a light jacket or sweater will suffice, as the evening chill mingles delicately with the remnants of warmth from the day.\n\nLooking towards Monday, the city appears poised for a shift toward partial brilliance, with expectations of partly sunny skies. That familiar golden warmth will stretch its arms around 63 degrees before gently retreating to a cooler embrace in the afternoon. While the day may start with bright promises, the north winds will add a robust spirit, with gusts swirling through the air, creating a lively backdrop for afternoon wanderings. Adventurous souls might consider a leisurely trek through nearby parks or a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, taking in the subtle beauty of the emerging day. Embrace the moment; the fog may still linger over the bay, but it only adds to the charm of this ever-enigmatic city.",
