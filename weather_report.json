    "weather_report": "As the sun dips into the horizon, the night air hangs thick with a soothing blanket of fog that rolls in from the ocean, lending an air of mystery to the city\u2019s streets. Downtown San Francisco is currently cloaked in a soft gray, the clouds swirling lazily above, hinting at the gentle coolness that accompanies the marine layer. The whisper of the west southwest wind at around twelve miles per hour creates a tantalizing contrast, stirring the air and reaching for those who dare to step outside.\n\nWhen dawn breaks, the fog will begin to recede, revealing a vibrant blue sky just in time for daytime wanderers. A sunny embrace awaits with a high near 70, perfect for those who revel in the refreshing climate of the bay area, transitioning into the softer warmth of afternoon as the temperature gently eases toward 67. For the day ahead, dress in layers: a light sweater or jacket will be your companion for the cooler morning air, easily shed as the sun bestows its golden warmth upon the city. \n\nWith such inviting conditions, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or an afternoon coffee at one of the outdoor caf\u00e9s, where the ambiance of gentle chatter mingles with the clinking of cups. Explore the quiet corners of the city or venture toward the parks, where the lush greenery contrasts delightfully with the fresh atmosphere. In these serene moments, the city reveals its charm, hidden beneath the veil of fog and sunlight, creating an experience both delightful and unique.",
