    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle overture of patchy drizzle begins to weave its way through the air. The clouds gather above like a soft quilt, enveloping the city in a cool embrace, with temperatures hovering around a mild 56 degrees. The wind whispers softly from the west southwest, reminding us of the ocean's unseen presence. As dawn approaches, the mist dances playfully, hinting at a day that will unfurl before us.\n\nFriday looks set to reveal hints of brightness after the morning drizzle, transforming the skies to partly sunny as the day matures. While the temperature creeps upward toward a high of 63, a subtle coolness lingers in the afternoon air, as though the city is reluctant to let go of the night. The wind will continue its gentle conversation, gusting up to 22 mph, a nice accompaniment for those who venture outdoors. The marine layer may settle in, particularly through the more brushed horizons towards the coast, offering that distinct coastal fog\u2014a signature of our city\u2019s character.\n\nIn terms of attire, layering will be your trusted friend this day. A light jacket with a cozy sweater beneath will provide comfort against the chill, as you explore the quaint streets, perhaps indulging in a warm beverage at a local caf\u00e9 while you observe the shift of the day. Art galleries, bookstores, or a serene walk through the park could offer delightful respite from the ebbs of drizzle, providing a rich, reflective experience that San Francisco so beautifully offers on such modest days.",
