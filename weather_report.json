A soft breeze carries in the faintest whispers of the lingering marine layer, but visibility remains largely unmarred\u2014a rare gift in this often fog-draped landscape. With a high of 62 degrees lingering tantalizingly nearby, temperatures will soon settle into a cooler embrace, cascading down to 48 degrees as nightfall approaches. \n\nAs you step outside, dress lightly yet wisely\u2014a soft sweater paired with something windproof might best suit your adventure as the warmth of day gives way to the cool embrace of the evening. The atmosphere invites leisurely exploration; stroll down to a nearby caf\u00e9 and indulge in the simple pleasure of coffee al fresco, or perhaps take a moment to appreciate the tranquil ambiance of a neighborhood park while the sun makes its graceful descent. In this moment, San Francisco reminds you how to savor the ordinary\u2014sky, breeze, and warmth captured in the fleeting essence of afternoon light.",
