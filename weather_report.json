    "weather_report": "As the sun glides high above the Bay today, Downtown San Francisco basks in a sea of warmth and light. The afternoon unfolds in crystalline clarity, with temperatures teasing the low seventy mark and a gentle westerly breeze whispering through the streets. The skies are unmarred by cloud or fog, allowing the iconic outline of the Golden Gate Bridge and the city skyline to stand proudly against a bracing blue expanse. Any lingering whispers of the marine layer seem much too shy to intrude, retreating to embrace the cool embrace of the bay, leaving only the splendid views for all to enjoy.\n\nAs evening approaches, the air carries the promise of a cool reprieve, inviting you to don a light jacket as temperatures dip into the fifty-sevens. The mild winds will continue, playful yet soothing, perfect for an evening stroll along the Embarcadero or a casual gathering with friends over coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9. Consider spending the day exploring the hidden charm of this vibrant city, or perhaps visiting an art gallery to enrich the senses. With such clement weather enveloping the evening, the world feels inviting, offering you the perfect reason to linger outside.",
