    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, a gentle sun illuminates the streets, hinting at a bright afternoon that will soon give way to a cool evening. The high, lingering around 64 degrees, is complemented by a breezy west-southwest wind, carrying whispers of the bay while tugging at hats and hair. Despite the sunny heart of the day, one might see the veil of a soft marine layer hovering near the Golden Gate, hinting at the gradual embrace of evening clouds. As dusk approaches, the forecast suggests a patch of drizzle might visit, bringing along a hint of chill, with temperatures dropping to around 56 degrees.\n\nAs you venture out today, consider layering\u2014a light jacket over a comfortable shirt will serve you well both in the warmth of the sun and the cool of the coming night. The weather, neither oppressive nor overly inviting, presents a palette of possibilities. Perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink would suit your fancy. Engage in the rhythm of the city, soaking in its vibrant yet serene atmosphere, while keeping an eye on those elusive fog banks that could soon drift in from the ocean.",
