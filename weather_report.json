    "weather_report": "In the quiet moments of the night, the cityscape of Downtown San Francisco shimmers softly beneath an almost velvety sky, where clouds occasionally dance in muted hues. Overnight temperatures descend gently to a crisp 52 degrees, ushering in a cool breeze that whispers through the empty streets. The forecast indicates a sun-soaked Sunday ahead, promising warmth with a high nearing 59 degrees. As the morning light breaks, expect clarity and brightness to illuminate the city, while gentle west winds create ripples of movement in the cool air.\n\nAs day unfolds, light may bring bursts of sunshine, yet the marine layer is still poised to linger in the shadows, especially along the iconic coastline. While the fog may retreat slightly, remnants could still sway in the distance, wrapping the Golden Gate Bridge in a soft embrace. For those venturing out, a light jacket or layered attire would offer comfort against the occasional chill along the waterfront. With such inviting conditions, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or discovering a new caf\u00e9 among the vibrant neighborhoods. Enjoy the subtle warmth of the sun on your shoulders, and let the day\u2019s beauty guide your path with ease and wonder.",
