    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night has unfolded under a cloak of mostly clear skies, with a gentle northwest breeze whispering through the streets. As the clock ticks on, the air remains crisp, inviting those prepared to embrace the chill with a light jacket, perfect for a tranquil evening stroll through the waterfront or the quiet embrace of a neighborhood caf\u00e9. The early morning light hints at a day that promises sunshine, though the temperatures will dip slightly in the afternoon, suggesting that layering would certainly be prudent.\n\nExpect Tuesday to dawn bright and mostly sunny, the kind of day that gently encourages one to step outside and relish the fresh air. While the morning will welcome with open arms a high near 60, the hours will nudge the temperature down to around 56, maintaining a pleasant coolness that is quintessentially San Francisco. The marine layer, often lurking by the bridges and along the coast, might just make a subtle appearance later, but for now, the visibility stretches across the bay, a limpid view that beckons a leisurely exploration of local parks or a thoughtful moment by the water's edge. In light of the conditions, a cozy sweater and some comfortable shoes will serve well for a day spent engaging with both the city\u2019s vibrant pulse and its serene spots.",
