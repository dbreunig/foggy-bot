    "weather_report": "In the early hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco rests beneath a crystalline expanse, a tranquil calm lingering in the air. The forecast reflects this serenity, promising mostly clear skies as the city cools to a gentle 52 degrees. A soft westward breeze whispers through the streets, adding to the charm of this peaceful morning. With the sun poised to rise and grace the day, the promise of sunshine lifts the spirits. As the day unfolds, temperatures are set to peak at a comfortable 64, tapering into the afternoon, when the warmth mingles with a brisk wind tugging at the edges of clothing.\n\nAs the morning light pours over the landscape, expect clarity to reign supreme, with any remnants of fog skillfully retreating to prepare the canvas for this vibrant day. However, don\u2019t be surprised if a few lonesome wisps linger near the coast, teasing the horizon. It\u2019s a day to savor outdoor pursuits\u2014ideal for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a cozy visit to a local caf\u00e9. Dress in layers: a light jacket or cardigan will serve you well against the chill of the morning and evening, while a comfortable shirt is perfect for the midday sun. Embrace the spirits of the city while basking in the delightful offerings of this sublime day ahead.",
