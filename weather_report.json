    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco basks in a gentle embrace of clouds, casting a soft veil across the city\u2019s iconic silhouette. The nocturnal chill lingers, urging comfort in layers as the temperature settles around a mild 59. A wisp of a breeze stirs, hinting at the awakening day ahead. As the sun rises, blue skies will unfurl, painting a picture of clarity against the bustling backdrop. By midday, warmth will wrap the city, reaching around 74 before subtly retreating to a more temperate 71. \n\nThe promise of a sunny Wednesday unfolds with crisp visibility, though the coastal marine layer may still hug the edges of the Bay, creating a dramatic contrast against the more open views. This is a day that encourages a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to one of the myriad caf\u00e9s, where aromatic brews invite warmth against the cool air. For those venturing outdoors, a light sweater or jacket will complement the comfortable attire, allowing for both ease and style. As evening approaches, one might pull a book from the shelf and savor the fading light, indulging in a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many parks. A day both inviting and invigorating lies ahead, the kind that reminds us to appreciate the subtle beauty of urban life.",
