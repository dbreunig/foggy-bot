    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the sky boasts a calm clarity, absent of the fog that often wraps the city in mystery. Tonight's low hovers around a cozy 54 degrees, accompanied by a gentle breeze from the southwest. The air feels crisp and invigorating, ideal for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the soft sounds of waves meet the shore.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the sun will rise to greet the city with optimism, promising a warm day near 69 degrees. Expect a subtle southwest wind that whispers through the streets, occasionally gusting, adding a slight rustle to the leaves and a refreshing breath to the day. As the sun illuminates the iconic skyline and paints the horizon, consider donning light layers that will keep you comfortable against the mild warmth and cool breeze. A warm cup of coffee from a local caf\u00e9 could be the perfect companion for a morning spent revisiting favorite haunts or perhaps exploring new corners of the vibrant city.",
