The day\u2019s high temperature hovers near a comfortable 60 degrees, though expect a slight coolness as the afternoon unfolds, nudging the mercury down to around 58. Despite these inviting temperatures, the city remains kissed by coastal influences; pockets of fog cling to the edges, teasing the Golden Gate without fully obscuring it, giving a soft-focus feel to the iconic landscape. \n\nAs night approaches, the sky will shift to a dreamy expanse of partly cloudy hues, settling at a low around 50. With winds picking up to around 24 mph, one might want to bundle in layers\u2014perhaps a lightweight jacket atop a cozy sweater would suffice. Consider an evening stroll along the waterfront, where the cool breeze mingles with the murmurs of the bay, or stop by a local caf\u00e9 for warm comfort, as the city begins to settle into its evening rhythm, a tapestry of life woven into the brisk air.",
