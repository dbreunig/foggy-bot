    "weather_report": "As the night gently yields to the early morning hours in Downtown San Francisco, a thick blanket of clouds envelops the city, echoing the soft whispers of an overnight marine layer. The temperature hovers around a mild 57 degrees, with a west-southwest breeze that carries the coolness of the bay. As dawn approaches, the promise of a mostly sunny day begins to materialize, suggesting a transition from the mysterious shadows of night to brighter vistas.\n\nBy midday, expect the sun to assert its presence, illuminating the streets with a high of 66. However, as the afternoon draws near, the warmth may ebb slightly to around 64, coaxed by the cool winds gusting from the west, reminiscent of the ocean\u2019s steady embrace. The clouds from the morning will retreat, yielding to patches of blue, although the remnants of fog may linger at the fringes of the horizon, wisps of vapor dancing delicately around the Golden Gate.\n\nConsidering these conditions, a light jacket or sweater would serve well during the cooler early hours, transitioning to lighter clothing for the warmth of the afternoon. This dynamic weather invites outdoor pursuits: a leisurely stroll through one of the city\u2019s iconic parks, perhaps, or a visit to an outdoor caf\u00e9 where one can savor a warm drink, taking note of the city\u2019s vibrant pulse as it begins to wake. Engage fully in the rhythm of this lovely day, where the sun gradually casts its golden hue over the bustling streets, teasing the promise of a peaceful, if fleeting, summer's day in the heart of San Francisco.",
