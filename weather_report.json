    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night unfurls with a gentle clarity, the air soft and cool, reminiscent of the whispers of a sea breeze. As the city bathes under a cerulean sky, the temperature rests comfortably at 56 degrees. The west-southwest wind dances lightly, creating an almost soothing atmosphere. As night turns to day, expect the sun to gradually illuminate the skyline, with temperatures reaching around 67 degrees by afternoon. Though the rays will likely shine bright, a hint of uncertainty lingers in the air, as there\u2019s a slight chance of rain beginning after five, a gentle reminder of the ever-mysterious Pacific climate.\n\nFor those stepping out, layers will be your faithful companion\u2014think light sweaters or jackets to fend off the cool wind, particularly during the morning\u2019s embrace. As the day unfolds, may the allure of the waterfront beckon you to take a walk, perhaps along the Embarcadero, where the rhythmic lapping of waves against the pier offers a serene backdrop to your thoughts. Alternatively, a casual caf\u00e9 visit in the warmth of the afternoon sun would also be a delightful way to enjoy this moderately pleasant day. Just as the bay's fog appears and dissipates, savor your hours here, navigating the delicate balance of sun and shadow that characterizes San Francisco.",
