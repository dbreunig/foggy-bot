    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the night has left a lingering chill in the air, with temperatures dipping to a mild 51 degrees. The scene unfolds mostly clear, the soft glow of city lights competing against the awakening sun. A gentle southwest breeze sways lightly, anticipating the promise of a sunny Tuesday. Come midday, the skies will be painted in warm hues, reaching a high near 63, though expect the temperature to concede to a cool afternoon retreat around 61.\n\nThe clarity of the day appears reassuring, with fog's embrace departing to reveal the iconic skyline. The marine layer, often persistent in the morning hours, has lifted, allowing the warmth of the sun to bathe the city. For those venturing outside, a light jacket should suffice against the brisk wind that could momentarily catch you off guard, particularly in more exposed areas. The gusts, at times reaching 28 mph, remind us of the bay's fluid dance, a backdrop to those exploring the rugged beauty of the Presidio or enjoying a leisurely stroll along Crissy Field. \n\nThis is a day to savor tranquility, perhaps with a quiet coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or a gentle hike along the coastal trails, where both the mind and spirit can breathe in the invigorating aroma of the sea.",
