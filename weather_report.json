    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a tapestry of scattered sunshine and racing clouds. Though the sun attempts to shine brightly, the cool bay breeze carries hints of lingering chill, as temperatures retreat gently from a high near sixty into the comfortable embrace of mid-fifties. The west wind whispers through the avenues, rustling the trees with a playful gust, creating an inviting sound backdrop as day transitions toward evening. \n\nAs night approaches, the clouds deepen and gather, a silent foreboding of rain that may arrive just as the clock strikes four in the morning. The air cools to a low of forty-nine, prompting passersby to wrap themselves in light layers for warmth\u2014perhaps a stylish jacket paired with a soft scarf. The day\u2019s clarity is hampered slightly by a marine layer creeping closer; visibility may waver, especially near the bay\u2019s edge. For those contemplating their evening, a gentle stroll along the Embarcadero could offer a scenic culmination to the day's work, allowing one to breathe in the cool maritime air, while the twinkling lights of the city begin to blink awake against the dimming horizon.",
