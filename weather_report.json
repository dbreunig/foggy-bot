    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a promising sunny sky, typical for this time of year. The air is brisk, complemented by a gentle westward breeze that dances about at moderate speeds, bringing a slight chill in anticipation of the afternoon\u2019s softening warmth. As clouds disperse, it becomes clear that today is set to maintain a pleasant clarity, an idyllic backdrop for the city\u2019s iconic sights. A perfect day for a leisurely stroll, perhaps along the Embarcadero, or to sip a calming cup of coffee outside, joining the ebb and flow of urban life.\n\nAs the sun reaches its zenith, temperatures will rise modestly, and the charming essence of late summer will embrace the streets. Should you venture out, a light jacket will serve well against the cool gusts, especially if wandering towards the western edge where marine layers tend to linger. The evening will present a delightful close to the day, with weather shifting to a mostly clear sky and cooler temperatures. This time might inspire a quiet dinner on a patio or perhaps a gathered conversation among friends as the sun sinks into the horizon. Overall, it promises to be a lovely day, inviting moments of connection with both the city and nature.",
