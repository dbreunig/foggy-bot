    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is a blend of subtle transitions. The sky bears the remnants of sun-kissed clarity, now softly cloaked in a veil of clouds that signal the approach of evening. With temperatures slipping toward a balmy 54 degrees, there's a gentle chill in the air, beckoning you to layer up. A slight breeze carries the briny scent of the ocean, hinting at the possibility of light drizzle as the night wears on.\n\nWhile the daylight was bathed in the soothing warmth of sunlight, you may observe a delicate haze in the distance, an ephemeral marine layer drifting in from the Pacific. It teases the edges of the cityscape, with its presence providing an idyllic backdrop for contemplative strolls along the Embarcadero or quiet moments on a cozy caf\u00e9 patio. As you plan your evening, consider a light jacket or a cardigan to embrace the coolness that tonight will usher in, and get lost in the quiet charm that only a San Francisco evening can offer.",
