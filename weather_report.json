    "weather_report": "As the city breathes in the coolness of another night, Downtown San Francisco rests beneath a canopy of mostly clear skies. The air holds a gentle freshness, whispering a low temperature around 56 degrees while the subtle northward breeze lightly stirs through the streets. A tranquility envelops the city, the sort that invites contemplative walks or cozy nights indoors, accompanied by an engrossing book or perhaps a hot cup of tea.\n\nTuesday promises to awaken the day with warmth and brightness, as the sun casts its beams over the skyline, reaching for a high near 77 degrees before gracefully retreating to a more temperate 74. While the forecast shows clarity reigning supreme, one might detect lingering hints of the marine layer\u2014those ethereal whispers of fog that often shuffle across the Golden Gate, reminding us of the ocean's breath. Ideally dressed for this balmy spring day, layers of light fabric will keep you comfortable as you move in and out of the sun, perhaps opting for a well-loved sweater or a light jacket should the breeze turn playful. This day calls for leisurely exploration\u2014perhaps a stroll along the waterfront to savor a scoop of artisan ice cream or a visit to a tucked-away caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee dances with the laughter of friends sharing stories over brunch, each moment steeped in the charm of this vibrant city.",
