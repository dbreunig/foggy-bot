    "weather_report": "As the sun begins its gentle descent in Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in a warm embrace of afternoon sunshine, intermittently inviting and slightly brisk due to a gentle west-southwest breeze. The current atmosphere quivers with potential, as the high near 62 degrees gives way to a more tempered approach as twilight beckons. A few cumulous whispers dot the sky, casting playful shadows across the cityscape, hinting at an evening that will gradually unfurl into a partly cloudy blanket, where temperatures will settle around a comfortable 52 degrees. \n\nIn the lingering moments of daylight, one might consider a stroll along the Embarcadero, the ocean air brushing against skin now slightly cooled by the evening\u2019s arrival. Here, one could indulge in a casual sit at a caf\u00e9, watching the world turn its focus toward dinner. A light jacket or a cozy sweater would serve well against the cooling winds that stir in anticipation of night. As fog dances at the periphery of the city, swirling gently yet remaining respectful of the skyline, its presence feels more like a tender tableau than a shroud, suggesting the joy of a quiet evening rather than a demanding chill.",
