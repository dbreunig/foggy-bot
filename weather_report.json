    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, a subtle dance of clouds drifts across the skyline, cloaking the city\u2019s contours in a gentle embrace of partial obscurity. With temperatures settling around a mild 51 degrees, the crispness in the air invites a light jacket, perhaps accompanied by a soft scarf, as whispers of the west-southwest wind flutter through the streets. Gusts may rise to meet you at 18 mph, cooling the warmth of any lingering daydreams.\n\nAs dawn unfolds tomorrow, the city breathes a sigh of relief, revealing a canvas largely painted in vibrant hues of blue. San Francisco anticipates a relatively gentle warmth, peaking at about 61 degrees. By afternoon, a subtle descent in temperature will usher in a familiar coastward chill, drawing forth that iconic marine layer but possibly keeping it at bay just far enough to maintain the clarity of a sunny day. The westerly winds, buoyant at 7 to 14 mph, remain playful, adding a dash of energy to your weekend plans. \n\nConsider this a splendid opportunity to stroll along the waterfront or meander through the city\u2019s neighborhoods, with the sun casting inviting shadows upon the pavement. A stop at a local caf\u00e9 could grant you a moment to savor a warm drink, the heat from your cup contrasting softly with the coolness of the breeze. This simple pleasure encapsulates the understated beauty of San Francisco\u2019s day, where each corner offers a fresh perspective, and every moment invites exploration.",
