    "weather_report": "As night blankets Downtown San Francisco, a tapestry of partially obscured stars twinkles above, while the city breathes in a gentle chill, settling into a low around 52 degrees. A soft west-southwest wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it the promise of a crisp, yet refreshing, evening. Tomorrow, the sun will rise to greet us with clarity, bathing the skyline in light as temperatures rise to a comfortable high of 59, gently retreating to a cooler 57 by afternoon.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, the day will reveal itself in brilliant sunshine, a refreshing contrast to the dim twilight now falling over the landscape. While the forecast dances around hints of marine influence, it seems the fog has chosen not to linger over the city tonight, leaving a clean and bright vista for those early risers. Given this splendid weather, a light layer perhaps\u2014a cardigan or a shawl\u2014might be just the ticket for strolling along the Embarcadero, or perhaps grabbing a calm coffee while admiring the brave sailboats dotting the bay. It's a perfect day to wander through the art-lined streets of the Mission or enjoy the quiet charm of Dolores Park, letting the gentle San Francisco breeze be your companion.",
