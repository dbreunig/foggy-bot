    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle embrace of sunshine, painted against a canvas of clear blue skies. The warmth of about 65 degrees invites the curious and the contemplative outdoors. A soft breeze from the west southwest, fluttering at about 14 mph, adds a refreshing layer to the day's pleasantness, though the temperatures will gracefully ebb to a cooler 62 as the afternoon wanes. Yet, as night approaches, the atmosphere thickens with the promise of patchy drizzle, creeping in after the witching hour of 2 AM, all while clouds gather overhead, serene and muted, with a low dipping to around 55.\n\nAs the day transitions, one may observe hints of the marine layer lingering near the coast, subtly veiling the majestic Golden Gate Bridge. Such moments of cloud and sun render the cityscape ethereal, like a soft whisper of fog just brushing against the iconic landmarks. In this mellow weather, it is best to dress in layers; perhaps a light sweater paired with breathable pants will keep you comfortably prepared for the coolness of evening. Consider taking a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the horizon blurs into the ocean, or indulge in a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, watching the world begin to wind down. The rhythm of the day gently persuades you to savor simplicity \u2013 a perfect scene for soaking in the city\u2019s understated charm.",
