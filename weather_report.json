    "weather_report": "As twilight settles gently over Downtown San Francisco, the city is cloaked in a veil of shifting clouds, hinting at both coolness and calm. This evening promises a temperature dipping to a mild 50 degrees, accompanied by a noticeable west-southwest wind that whistles softly through the streets, creating a soundtrack of rustling leaves and distant laughter. The air, tinged with salt from the Bay, carries whispers of the approaching night, while patches of fog swirl around, especially clinging near the Golden Gate, infusing the landscape with an ethereal quality.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, a promise of sunshine emerges, with the temperature gently rising to the low 60s, bathing the city in a golden glow. Winds will continue to dance through the avenues, though perhaps with slightly less vigor than tonight. For those considering how to spend their daylight hours, a light jacket will suffice to embrace the brisk air, perfect for a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely coffee at your favorite caf\u00e9, where the warmth and aroma create a cozy refuge from the cool breeze. This moment calls for quiet enjoyment, whether it's absorbing the views from a sunlit park or lingering over afternoon conversations hidden behind the windowpanes, contemplating life with a cup of something warm in hand.",
