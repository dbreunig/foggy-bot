    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfurls under a warm embrace of sunshine, the kind that gently invites you to linger a moment longer in the elements. The temperature hovers comfortably around sixty-seven, a delightful setting to take a stroll or unearth the secrets of the city you\u2019ve yet to explore. With the west wind nudging at fourteen to eighteen miles per hour and occasional gusts chiming in at twenty-three, it offers a refreshing touch, reminding you that even in summer, San Francisco dances at the boundary of warmth and coolness. \n\nAs the sun begins its descent and the evening beckons, expect the skies to remain mostly clear, with temperatures slipping to a soft fifty-seven. The gentle winds will continue to weave through the evening air, offering a serene backdrop to your nighttime ventures. Today\u2019s clarity is poignant, posing only a distant hint of fog on the horizon, its influence kept at bay. This presents a splendid opportunity to wear light layers, perhaps a breathable sweater or a light jacket that can be easily shed as the sun casts its warm glow. As evening approaches, consider gathering your loved ones for a casual meal at an outdoor caf\u00e9 or perhaps seek a quiet corner in a nearby park, where the day\u2019s remnants melt seamlessly into twilight, holding hands with the rhythms of a calm San Francisco evening.",
