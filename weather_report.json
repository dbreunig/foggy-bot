    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a glorious canopy of blue, where the sun reigns supreme and the air is crisp yet gentle. As we approach the afternoon, temperatures hover comfortably near 66 degrees, slipping slightly to a pleasant 64. The westerly breeze whispers through the streets, rustling the leaves and carrying the promise of a brightness that invigorates the spirit. Though the city glows beneath the sun's embrace, the edges of the Golden Gate remain cloaked in a delicate marine layer, hinting that the bay's fog may linger just beyond complete clarity.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the evening will bring a soft shifting from the warmth of daytime to a cooler embrace around 56 degrees. The winds, still playful, will ease a touch, setting a tranquil backdrop for an evening stroll or a cozy gathering at one of the city's cafes. Given these favorable conditions, the day invites one to don light layers for comfort, perhaps a cardigan for the later hours. As the sun tucks itself away, consider taking a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, pausing to admire the reflections on the water\u2014a simple yet enriching way to savor the remaining daylight.",
