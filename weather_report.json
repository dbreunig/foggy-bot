    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a canvas of brilliant sunlight, coaxing temperatures upwards to a gentle 65 degrees. The breeze, a lively west-southwest current, dances through the streets at 18 mph, occasionally gusting as high as 23 mph, creating a refreshing atmosphere that beckons one outside. The crisp clarity of the day is tinged with a slight chance of drizzle later tonight, a mere whisper of precipitation lingering in the air. The low of 56 will arrive with the night, as clouds gather and soften the edges of the skyline.\n\nAs you step into this balmy afternoon, dress in layers\u2014a light sweater over a casual shirt will do just nicely against the invigorating wind. The golden glow of this sun-kissed day offers an ideal backdrop for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps indulging in a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9 with a book, or simply soaking in the vibrant city life. While the call of the outdoors is tantalizing, savor an evening visit to one of the city\u2019s hidden gems\u2014an art gallery or a cozy bookstore\u2014before the night descends, wrapped in the promise of a breezy, starry sky.",
