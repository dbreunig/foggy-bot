    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle tinge of the marine layer caresses the city, hinting at the delicate dance between fog and sun that defines this coastal enclave. The air carries with it the soft promise of a day touched by warmth, though a slight chance of drizzle still lingers in the morning air. Throughout the day, one can expect the sun to steal the show in moments, warming the city to approximately 64 degrees, and inviting a mellow breeze\u201413 to 23 miles per hour\u2014across the iconic streets.\n\nAs the afternoon unfolds, the temperature will fall to a cool embrace of around 61 degrees, while hulking clouds may linger to remind us of the ocean's breath. The winds, steadfast and playful, rustle leaves with a hint of mischief, urging residents to don layers comfortable yet airy. A light sweater coupled with breathable clothing would be wise, ensuring you\u2019re prepared should the clouds hover longer than expected. As evening approaches, a gentle drizzle may visit once more, but for now, the city stands poised for encounters inspired by the whimsical shift of weather. Consider a stroll through one of the quieter parks, where the beauty of nature mingles with the urban landscape, or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, an ideal refuge to sip warm tea while watching the world drift by in the soft light of late afternoon.",
