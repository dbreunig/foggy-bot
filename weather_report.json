    "weather_report": "In the tranquil hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco rests under a gauzy veil of clouds that carries the promise of a clear day ahead. The temperature is mild, reminiscent of a sweet spring evening, hanging around 51 degrees, with a gentle breeze whispering from the west. As the sun approaches the horizon, the sky hints at brightness, foreshadowing a mostly sunny Thursday that will see temperatures climbing comfortably to about 65 degrees, though they may dip slightly by afternoon, offering respite from the warmer sun.\n\nYet, for now, there is a subtle ambiguity in the atmosphere, where distant sights may be softened by the early vestiges of fog, particularly around the bay. As the sun rises and warms the earth, expect the marine layer to recede, unveiling the stunning contours of the Golden Gate and the jagged hills that cradle the city. To fully appreciate this transition, dressing in layers would be wise\u2014a light jacket for the cooler morning and a t-shirt beneath for the embrace of the afternoon sun. With such delightful weather unfolding, it would be the perfect opportunity for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or enjoying a morning coffee at a local caf\u00e9, where the city starts to awaken with its own pulse.",
