With a low temperature around 50 degrees and a gentle west-southwest breeze whispering through the streets, the night feels refreshing, inviting those awake to savor the quietude before dawn breaks. The clouds will soon give way to a more cheerful disposition come Saturday, where the sun is anticipated to assert its presence, casting inviting warmth over the city, with temperatures peaking near 66, before settling gently to around 64 in the afternoon.\n\nWith visibility improving as the day unfolds, the potential for a marine layer lingers but will retreat, allowing glimpses of the iconic skyline intertwined with blue skies. While fog may still hug closer to the water, it will gradually yield to a clearer vista\u2014each ray illuminating the vibrancy of the streets below. Attire for today should be layered, combining light long sleeves with a reliable jacket to shield against the lingering chill of the morning breeze. As the city awakens, consider this a delightful opportunity for a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park or perhaps a brief visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a comforting cup of coffee. Simple pleasures await, perfectly suited to the rhythm of a spring day in San Francisco.",
