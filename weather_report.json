    "weather_report": "San Francisco greets the morning with a delicate blend of sunshine and a gentle breeze, promising a day that balances warmth with the coolness often found in this coastal city. The streets shimmer under a veil of mild clarity, the horizon painted with hints of blue as the layers of fog give way. With temperatures peaking around the mid-60s, the inviting warmth of the day beckons residents to venture outdoors, though the brisk westerly winds remind one to dress thoughtfully\u2014perhaps layers, with a light jacket to ward off the chill that lingers in the air.\n\nAs the day unfolds, a soft glow will harmonize with the calming rustle of leaves, making it an ideal backdrop for an afternoon stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment immersed in a local caf\u00e9. The breeze, spirited yet soothing, will dance through the streets, encouraging a leisurely bike ride or a pause to soak in the sights of the city. As night descends, the clouds will blanket the sky, transitioning into a tranquil evening that whispers of the warmth lost to the chill\u2014an invitation to snuggle into cozy attire, as you settle in with a book or perhaps explore the diverse culinary scene that thrives in the heart of the city.",
