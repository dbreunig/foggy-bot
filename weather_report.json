    "weather_report": "The coastal morning in San Francisco unfolds slowly, wrapped in a gentle embrace of partial cloudiness that dances above the city. As the sun begins its ascent, it offers a promise of a sunny day ahead, nudging the cool air from the Pacific and coaxing it away from the shores. The current temperature is a mild 56, a comforting prelude to the warmth that will bubble up later with a high of around 65. The west winds, enhancing the day\u2019s freshness, sweep through at a steady pace of 10 to 24 mph, occasionally sending gusts of invigorating air that flirt with 30 mph, reminding us of the city\u2019s ever-present dynamism.\n\nAlthough the haze of the night lingers slightly, the horizon is starting to blur away that marine layer, giving way to a clearer day ahead. As the sunlight begins to scatter its golden hues, the Golden Gate Bridge stands poised in quiet majesty, waiting for the early risers to lend it life. It is a day not for the brisk and bustling agenda but for leisurely explorations along the waterfront, where one might slip into a light jacket against the morning chill. The clarity of the day ushers in a perfect opportunity for a stroll through the Presidio, or perhaps a visit to one of the city's quaint caf\u00e9s to sip on a steaming cup of coffee, savoring the tranquil ambiance as the city awakens around you. By midday, the warmth will beckon, inviting a transition into lighter layers that embrace the sunny delights yet to come.",
