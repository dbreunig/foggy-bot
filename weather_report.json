    "weather_report": "The evening envelops Downtown San Francisco in a gentle embrace, the air cool with whispers of the night's breeze. With temperatures dipping to around 46, a northwest wind dances lightly, sending sprightly gusts through the streets. The skies above remain mostly clear, revealing the celestial tapestry speckled with stars, though subtle hints of fog linger along the bay, indicating the persistent marine layer that characteristically kisses the Golden Gate. As twilight deepens, one feels the freshness of this maritime atmosphere, not overly harsh, inviting a stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 where warm drinks await.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the sun will rise bright, casting golden rays upon the city. Expect warmth to settle in gradually, with a high near 59, highlighting the charm of the day as temperatures ease down to the mid-50s in the afternoon. The wind, still playful, will accompany the sun, creating an invigorating atmosphere for outdoor pursuits. Embrace the cozy yet breathable layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket or sweater\u2014to navigate the shifting temperatures, making it ideal for casual walks through the lively streets or an afternoon spent wandering in the nearby parks, where the invigorating scent of spring blooms lingers in the air.",
