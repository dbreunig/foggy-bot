    "weather_report": "As the moonlight bathes Downtown San Francisco in a soft glow, the night presents itself as mostly cloudy, a gentle reminder of the coastal fog that drapes the bay. The temperatures dip just enough to warrant a light layer, as a cool southwest wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it a hint of salt and the promise of change. The city, drenched in a muted light, stands resilient against the looming fog that seems to linger, yet maintains a quiet elegance.\n\nWith the dawn approaching, tomorrow holds the expectation of partly sunny skies, giving way to a high near sixty. The air will warm, but the soft wind will remain, inviting those who wander to don a light jacket or a cozy sweater. It is a day urging residents out\u2014to stroll the peaceful streets of the Mission or explore the hidden nooks of North Beach. Maybe savoring a warm cup of coffee while watching the world unfold from the comfort of a public square is just what\u2019s needed to embrace the mildness of the day. With the marine layer retreating for a bit, the Golden Gate may emerge, offering an enticing backdrop for a leisurely wander.",
