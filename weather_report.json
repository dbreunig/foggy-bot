With clear skies extending beyond your view, the day's brightness seems almost on the verge of playfulness, lightly coaxing you to take a stroll along the waterfront. The daylight nudges temperatures just a breath away from the mid-sixties, making it a splendid time to enjoy the outdoor caf\u00e9s or perhaps lose yourself in one of the many vibrant parks that dot the cityscape. \n\nAs the evening draws near, the air will cool gracefully, settling to a comfortable chill around fifty-two degrees. The west wind murmurs softly through the streets, hinting at the calm following the day's vibrant energy. For those venturing out tonight, a light layer will be your best companion against the nipping air, transforming a casual outing into a cozy experience. The absence of fog and the insistence of clarity make this an opportune moment to explore, whether wandering through the artistic enclaves of the Mission or finding a quiet spot to watch the sunset paint the sky.",
