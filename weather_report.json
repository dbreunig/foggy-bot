    "weather_report": "As the city rests in the early hours, a slight chance of rain whispers through the air, marking a transition as the clouds glide silently across the skyline. The cool night embraces San Francisco with a low temperature near fifty, while a gentle west-southwest breeze carries the faintest scent of the ocean\u2019s salt. Awareness of the day ahead stirs as dawn approaches\u2014a day that promises mostly cloudy skies, making for a subdued yet intriguing backdrop against which the city will unfold.\n\nAs the sun rises, it will struggle to break through the mottled gray blanket above, with temperatures peaking around sixty-three degrees before softly descending in the afternoon. The marine layer, a familiar presence, will linger over the bay and possibly shroud the Golden Gate Bridge, creating an ethereal landscape that is both captivating and a touch melancholic. Those in search of comfort should bundle up in layers, a light jacket or sweater sufficient for wandering the streets or sipping coffee at a neighborhood caf\u00e9 while indulging in the rhythm of urban life. A stroll along the waterfront in the later morning might reveal moments of clarity, where the iconic views of the Bay spark a flicker of inspiration and creativity, leading one to savor the quiet magic of a San Francisco Sunday.",
