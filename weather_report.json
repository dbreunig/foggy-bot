    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day begins under a shroud of muted clouds, balancing on the edge of clarity and mystery. The air carries the crisp tang of the ocean, a reminder of the Pacific's embrace, while a gentle wind whispers promises of moderation. As the morning progresses, expect the veil of cloudiness to lift somewhat, revealing moments of sunshine that dance across the cityscape, inviting residents and visitors alike to step outside and savor the temperate embrace of summer.\n\nWith a high nudging towards 66 degrees and a welcoming breeze from the west southwest, the atmosphere speaks of comfort. However, be prepared for the temperatures to dip as we slide gently into the afternoon. The slight chill calls for lightweight layers; a light cardigan or a scarf might accompany your morning attire well. Today is perfect for leisurely pursuits\u2014perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, taking in the textures of the waterfront, or a quiet moment with a book at your favorite caf\u00e9, watching the world drift by, all while the iconic outlines of city structures tease through the slowly dissipating fog.",
