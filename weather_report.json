    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, this afternoon unfolds with a gentle caress of sunshine, though the horizon teeters on the edge of a possible rain shower. The temperature hovers in the mid-fifties, a subtle reminder of the season's cool embrace as west winds whisper at 15 mph, occasionally gusting stronger. Wisps of cloud drift lazily across the sky, casting a delicate veil over the city\u2019s iconic skyline, enriching the air with a promise of change. The chance of precipitation flirts at 20%, offering only the slightest hope for a cleansing rain.\n\nAs twilight descends, expect a shift; a slight chance of rain emerges before 10 p.m., ramping up to a 40% likelihood of scattered showers throughout the night. The temperature will dip towards the mid-forties, inviting you to wrap yourself in a cozy layer. A light or medium jacket would serve well against the cool, breezy spells that will persist through the evening. In these conditions, consider a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or a quiet evening with a good book in your favorite caf\u00e9, perfect for watching the city\u2019s vibrant life play out as the air freshens with the scent of impending rain.",
