    "weather_report": "Overnight in Downtown San Francisco, the skies remain mostly clear, wrapping the city in a stillness that hints at the cool air settling in. The morning light, soft and gentle, promises a sunny day ahead as temperatures leisurely tiptoe towards the low sixties. As the sun rises, expect a crisp northwest wind to playfully brush the skin, reminiscent of the ocean's breath, while the chill from the night lingers softly in the air. \n\nThe absence of fog suggests a clarity that welcomes exploration; however, it\u2019s essential to dress in layers, as the temperature will gradually dip through the afternoon. A light sweater or jacket will ensure comfort, keeping the coolness at bay while allowing for a pleasant stroll through the city\u2019s inviting streets. Take the opportunity to visit the nearby parks or cozy cafes, where the warmth of coffee can match the daytime glow, or perhaps indulge in a leisurely walk along the waterfront, where the expansive views can briefly take one's breath away before inhaling the salty air.",
