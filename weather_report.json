    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day begins under a mixed canvas of clouds and sunny patches, a curtain gently lifted to reveal glimpses of the beloved skyline. A brisk west wind propels the air, weaving through avenues and along the waterfront at a steady pace. This combined tempo of coolness and clarity suggests a lively morning awash in muted colors, a gentle wake-up call for the city\u2019s early risers. As the sun bows gracefully toward its zenith, the forecast promises a high of 62, sliding gracefully into a refreshing coolness by afternoon.\n\nCurrently, a marine layer sprawls insidiously across the bay, softening the horizon but allowing enough sunlight to break through. It hints at a misty charm\u2014like a whisper from the ocean\u2014while ridding the air of stifling heat. Those venturing outdoors today may find comfort in layers; a light sweater or jacket will serve well against the gusty winds, perfect companions in a landscape wherein the cool freshness invigorates your spirit. Plan your day thoughtfully\u2014perhaps a stroll through the Mission District to enjoy street art and local coffee or a quiet sit at a caf\u00e9 along the Embarcadero, watching the ripples glide by under the shimmering light. Each activity beckons with the promise of serenity beneath the expansive sky.",
