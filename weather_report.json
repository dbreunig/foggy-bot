    "weather_report": "As darkness envelops Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a cool whisper, suggesting the familiar embrace of the marine layer. Tonight, the city sits mostly shrouded in clouds, with a gentle breeze teasing through the streets at a steady pace, reminding all of summer\u2019s delicate transition into the cooler embrace of evening. The temperature, hovering around a mild 53 degrees, invites a light jacket, perhaps one that can withstand a whispering wind gusting playfully up to 23 miles per hour. \n\nIn the morning, the fog will retreat, allowing the sun to cast its soft warmth across the cityscape. Expect a pleasant rise in the daytime temperature to about 62 degrees, with the afternoon drawing in a drop toward 60, as the winds dance a bit more vigorously. The day\u2019s clarity will encourage leisurely strolls along the waterfront, where the sights of sailboats can be admired against the backdrop of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, and art-filled corners of the Mission District await exploration. Dressing in layers is prudent; a comfortable blend of light fabrics beneath a slightly heavier top will serve well against the cool breezes as you savor the city\u2019s unfolding beauty in the mellow warmth of the sun.",
