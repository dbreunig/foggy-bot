    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco greets you with a quiet grace, hinting at the lingering embrace of the marine layer. Soft drizzle has danced in the air before retreating, leaving behind a veil of patchy clouds that will gradually give way to blue skies later in the day. The temperature is equally gentle, reaching a high of around 62, and the day carries with it the crisp breath of a west-southwest wind. This breeze, playful yet certain, whispers through the city streets at a brisk seven to fourteen miles per hour, adding a dash of refreshment to the atmosphere. As you step outside, you may notice that the coastal fog still weaves its tendrils around the distant outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the hills beyond, a reminder of the ocean's presence even amidst urban energy.\n\nAs the evening descends, expect the clouds to thicken, wrapping the city in a soft, gray shawl that promises a cozy night. With temperatures dipping to around 56, layering becomes essential. Therefore, consider slipping into a light sweater or a jacket, perfect for the cool wind that may greet you as you venture out. The conditions invite a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet afternoon at a local caf\u00e9, where you can savor a warm drink while watching the world drift by. Embrace the charm of this day, where the promise of sunlight will eventually emerge, enlivening the city yet keeping a hint of the bay's mystique alive.",
