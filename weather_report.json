    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco under a comforting embrace of sunshine, an inviting prelude to the evening. The radiant glow highlights the city's iconic hills and glistening bay, whilst a gentle breeze stirs, whispering through the streets. Temperatures hover in the low sixties, offering a pleasant respite from the heat that often locks its grip on more inland areas. It\u2019s a day that invites you to leisurely explore, perhaps savoring a stroll along the waterfront or taking in the views from a quiet caf\u00e9 terrace.\n\nAs the sun begins its retreat, clouds will gradually gather, hinting at a shift in the atmosphere. The promise of light drizzle arrives after dawn, caught at the edges of the city's typically sharp skyline. A slight chill will accompany the evening, nudging the cool winds from the west that can be anticipated as a hallmark of coastal life here. Dress comfortably with layers; a light jacket would serve well against the incoming cloud cover and any possible drizzle. As day gracefully melds into night, consider a quiet walk through the streets as they glow softly under streetlights, perhaps culminating in a cozy evening spent in a local bistro, watching the world drift by outside the window.",
