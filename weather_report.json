    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a quilt of soft clouds, a gentle reminder that spring has yet to fully awaken. Although there hangs a slight whisper of rain in the air, the day presents a mix of partly sunny skies and lingering shadows. As the temperature delicately skims the mid-fifties, the west wind carries a crisp coolness that nudges you to wrap a light jacket around your shoulders. This climate, often capricious, cloaks the city in an ethereal ambiance, leaving only hints of the sun peeking through.\n\nTonight, the forecast hints at further possibilities of rain, transforming the evening into a dance of fleeting showers. With the night descending and temperatures dipping into the cool forties, the air might invite you to linger indoors, perhaps curled up with a book and a steaming cup of tea. For those determined to venture out, a light raincoat and comfortable shoes will shield against the sporadic showers. A leisurely stroll along an empty street, framed by subdued lights reflecting off wet pavement, might be one of the few perfect pleasures this evening offers. The fog may flirt at the edges, but for now, it remains discreet, an artist's brush lightly smudging the skyline rather than consuming it entirely.",
