    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls its soft light over Downtown San Francisco, the city appears shrouded in a delicate blanket of clouds. The temperature rests comfortably at around 61 degrees, perfectly poised for a morning that hints at warmth yet retains the coolness characteristic of this coastal gem. A light breeze whispers through the streets, a gentle southwest wind that brings with it the possibility of marine fog clinging stubbornly to the edges of the cityscape.\n\nAs the day progresses, the forecast brings a sense of cautious optimism. The promise of a partly sunny afternoon, with temperatures climbing to nearly 69 degrees, invites residents to shed their layers and embrace the warmth\u2014though it may remain wise to keep a light jacket nearby, as the evening\u2019s chill is never far behind. While the sky may tease the chance of rain as the day transitions into dusk, it's a mere flutter of uncertainty with only a 20% chance of precipitation.\n\nWith the air filled with the briny scent of the Pacific and the occasional glimpse of blue peeking through the clouds, this day calls for simple pleasures. Consider taking a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or visiting the local caf\u00e9 for a warm beverage, the perfect companion to a good book. Alternatively, a picnic in one of the city's parks, with an eye to the skies, could deliver snippets of sunshine between the clouds, making for a delightful escape into nature. Dress in layers, embracing the casual elegance the day offers\u2014comfortable shirts, perhaps a light sweater, and shoes suited for a gentle wander through the heart of the city.",
