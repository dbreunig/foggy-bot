The temperature hovers near 58, a refreshing contrast to the lingering chill that often carpets the city. A soft west wind whispers along the streets, creating a ballet of leaves and the occasional flutter of fabric against warm skin. As the day stretches on, the horizon displays muted tones, hinting at the brief interludes of blue interspersed with the gray of passing clouds. \n\nAs dusk creeps near, the sky will settle into a mostly clear canvas, allowing for a peaceful transition to low temperatures around 49. The south-southwest winds continue their gentle caress, promising a quiet evening. With layers a wise choice for attire\u2014perhaps a light sweater combined with a trusty jacket\u2014one might find joy in an evening stroll along the waterfront, pausing to savor a cup of coffee or lingering over dinner at a cozy bistro, where laughter flows as easily as the wine. Today is one of those hidden gems, inviting those who wander to explore intimate corners of the city with both comfort and a sense of adventure.",
