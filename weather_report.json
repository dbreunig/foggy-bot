    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds gently under a partly sunny sky, as a soft breeze carries the whispers of the ocean. The temperature caresses the high of 62, a perfect prelude to a mild evening. As daylight begins to wane, the clouds gather, hinting at the patchy drizzle promised for the early hours of the night. With a low settling around 56, the air grows cooler, and the west-southwest winds remain a constant companion, their subtle gusts stirring the leaves and bringing with them the scent of sea salt and possibility.\n\nThough there\u2019s a light coverage lurking in the distance, the coastal marine layer is not yet imposing; visibility remains decent as the famous landmarks stand resilient against a backdrop of shifting clouds. As a gentle observer might take to the streets, a light jacket or layered attire will suffice against the embracing coolness of the evening. Perhaps a winding stroll through the nearby streets to appreciate the city as it glows at dusk; or a quiet moment in a coffee shop, reflective and warm, as the drizzle begins to flirt with the pavement\u2014a peaceful end to the day, if only for a while.",
