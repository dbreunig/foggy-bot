As the sun prepares to rise, bringing warmth with it, the early hours are marked by a clear sky\u2014a gentle transition from the cool embrace of evening into the promise of dawn. With temperatures expected to linger around the mid-40s, a light jacket will keep you comfortable against the cool breezes that dance through the streets.\n\nAs Saturday unfolds, the sun will make its appearance, unveiling a mostly sunny day, but not without the hint of a chill returning in the afternoon. The city will find itself wrapped in a soft embrace of clouds, with a diverse range of gray and blue tones painting the skyline. Fog won\u2019t dominate the scene today, but the whisper of the marine layer may drift in from the west, reminding everyone of the city\u2019s ever-scenic interplay between land and ocean. This gentle serenity sets the perfect backdrop for languorous strolls along the waterfront or quiet moments in one of the city\u2019s many inviting parks. Today may not present the vibrant warmth of summer, but its charm lies in its mildness\u2014a day for easy leisure, perhaps a jaunt to a local caf\u00e9 or a visit to an art exhibit, where the atmosphere is just as refreshing as the air outside.",
