    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun casts a gentle warmth across Downtown San Francisco, its rays teasing a delicate dance on the city streets. With temperatures hovering close to 69 degrees, there is a crispness in the air, stirred ever so slightly by a west-southwest wind that sways the leaves and ruffles the collars of passersby. As the afternoon unfurls, a whisper of change emerges; by late afternoon, temperatures will drift down to a comfortable 65, hinting at the twilight that approaches.\n\nTonight, a veil of patchy drizzle is anticipated, creeping in after 11 PM under a mostly cloudy sky. A low around 58 will call for a light jacket, perhaps layered with a soft scarf to fend off the cool breeze. The chance of precipitation, though modest at 20%, serves as a reminder of the ocean's proximity, ready to mingle with the city's nuanced ambiance. The presence of fog lingers in the distance; while it may not blanket the city now, its potential flirtations suggest a marine layer that could sweep in by nightfall. For an evening out, consider visiting a cozy caf\u00e9 or an intimate bookstore where one can savor the scent of brewing coffee or the musty pages of novels, as the city subtly transforms into night.",
