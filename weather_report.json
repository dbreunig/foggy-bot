    "weather_report": "As the afternoon light bathes Downtown San Francisco, the city enjoys a sunny respite, with a gentle warmth that wraps around the streets like a welcoming embrace. The temperature hovers near 65 degrees, gradually retreating to about 62 as the day leans toward evening. A brisk southwest wind stirs, carrying with it the invigorating scent of the ocean and the promise of a cooler evening. While the sun reigns overhead, hints of marine layer linger at the city's edges, soft clouds drifting lazily near the Golden Gate, not imposing but marking the horizon with their silent presence.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the clouds will thicken slightly, inviting a calm and cozy atmosphere. With a low settling around 54 degrees, you might find comfort in a light jacket or a cozy sweater, perfect for an evening stroll along the Embarcadero or finding a seat at an outdoor caf\u00e9 to savor a cup of coffee as the city lights begin to twinkle against the deepening sky. The crisp air, coupled with the relaxed tempo of the afternoon, suggests a day well spent, mingling with friends or indulging in a solitary moment of reflection as you absorb the vibrant pulse of this unforgettable city.",
