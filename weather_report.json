    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is already thick with expectation. A steady fog weaves through the city streets, kissing the tops of buildings and creating a soft hush across the often bustling urban landscape. The forecast warns of rain, set to sweep in after 11 PM, and indeed, the air feels charged with that first breath before a storm\u2014cool and slightly electric. The clouds hang low and heavy, lending a muted quality to the night sky, while gusts from the south whisper promises of dampness and chill. \n\nFriday will bring little relief from the weather, as rain is set to continue throughout the day, settling into the details of daily life. The city will wear a cloak of clouds, draping itself in shades of gray, reflecting the rhythm of life that persists even in dreary weather. For those venturing outside, a sturdy coat and waterproof shoes will serve well against the oncoming rain, complemented by perhaps an umbrella\u2014a daily companion to navigate the city\u2019s curves. It\u2019s an ideal backdrop for quiet indoor pursuits: consider a leisurely stroll through a local gallery or curling up with a good book in a cozy caf\u00e9 as the rain patters gently against the windows, a perfect accompaniment to thought and reverie.",
