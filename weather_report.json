    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a whisper of humidity, wrapped in the embrace of a gentle west-southwest breeze. The sky, a muted cloth of gray, suggests that the marine layer has rolled in with its characteristic subtlety, veiling the skyline yet leaving the essence of the city intact. With temperatures resting around a mild 57 degrees, the prospect of light drizzle after five am warrants a touch of caution; a light jacket might serve well against the chill that comes with nightfall. Yet, the anticipated rain, minimal as it is, dances on the fringes of probability - a mere 20% chance lingering like a gentle memory of summer's warmth.\n\nTomorrow beckons with a promise of shifting moods. A slight chance of drizzle before eleven will greet the dawn, giving way to a mostly sunny afternoon that may brighten the spirits of those wandering the streets. Expect temperatures to lift just above 65 degrees and then gently trace their way back down as the day unfolds. Dressing in layers will be the key, allowing one to embrace the cool morning and transition comfortably to the gentle warmth of midday. Perhaps a stroll by the waterfront or a coffee in one of the local haunts would blend perfectly with these conditions, allowing for quiet moments to savor the simplicity of life in San Francisco's storied embrace.",
