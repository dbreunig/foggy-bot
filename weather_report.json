    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this Friday morning, Downtown San Francisco awakens to the cool embrace of a partly cloudy sky, the air tinged with a gentle breeze from the west southwest. As dawn breaks, the temperature hovers around a comfortable 50 degrees, offering an invitation for a brisk stroll or perhaps a quiet moment with a warm cup of coffee. The clarity of the day is gradually unfolding, with hints of sunshine promising a splendid transformation as the hours pass.\n\nBy midday, the city will be bathed in sunlight, with temperatures climbing to about 60 degrees. The wind will pick up slightly, adding a vibrant edge to the atmosphere, rustling leaves and playfully tousling hair as you venture outdoors. For those heading into the day, light layers are advisable\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a comfortable shirt\u2014as the winds may remind you of the ocean's proximity. The absence of fog or a thick marine layer will allow for an unobstructed view of the iconic sights, encouraging leisurely explorations along the waterfront or through the labyrinthine streets of the city. Consider visiting a local caf\u00e9 or savoring the tranquility of a park, where the early spring blooms can add a touch of brightness to your day.",
