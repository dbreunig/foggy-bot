    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a subtle hint of moisture, a soft reminder of the overnight drizzles, which linger like whispers in the cool breeze. As the morning unfolds, the clouds recede slightly, allowing slivers of sunlight to break through, turning the skyline into a muted tapestry of gray and blue. The high near 67 offers a gentle warmth that is soon tempered by a west-southwest wind, which stirs the city in a playful manner, bringing with it the crispness reminiscent of a fresh autumn day. \n\nAs we move into the evening, expect a chance of drizzle to return, creating a reflective sheen on the streets and a cozy atmosphere perfect for intimate wanderings or quiet evenings indoors. A low of around 60 wraps the night in a comfortable embrace. For those venturing out, layering is recommended\u2014a light sweater or jacket serves to ward off the chill while still allowing for ease of movement. You might enjoy a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the lights of the city shimmer against the bay, or maybe delight in a warm drink from a local caf\u00e9 while watching the world go by.",
