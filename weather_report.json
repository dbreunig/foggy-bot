    "weather_report": "As the city of San Francisco awakens, the atmosphere carries a soft embrace of marine air, hinting at the slight chance of drizzle overnight. The clouds linger, their wispy forms obscuring the gentle glow of dawn. Temperatures rest comfortably around 57 degrees, with a light west-southwest wind whispering through the streets. \n\nAs the day unfolds, those heading out can expect the clouds to part, revealing the city\u2019s iconic skyline under a mostly sunny sky. With a peak temperature nudging 66 degrees, there\u2019s a refreshing chill that will gradually give way to warmth as the afternoon settles in. The breeze picks up, fluttering through neighborhood parks and along the waterfront, making this a delightful day for a leisurely stroll or a visit to a local caf\u00e9. Dressed in layers, a light sweater or jacket will be your ally as you navigate the cooler morning air, giving way to a pleasant tartness of early autumn as the sun climbs higher. In these tranquil hours, consider exploring a small art gallery or indulging in a book at your favorite haunt, each moment savoring the city\u2019s charm as it quietly bustles to life.",
