The forecast heralds a high close to 64 degrees, dipping gradually into a comfortable embrace of 54 as night blankets the city. The light shines brightly, lending itself to a serene atmosphere, although the whispers of a swift west-southwest wind\u2014known to dance playfully at speeds of 12 to 22 mph\u2014remind us that the golden hour isn\u2019t without its brisk moments. \n\nThe subtle formations suggest a lurking marine layer, hinting at the fog that often drapes its mysterious shawl over the landscape, yet for now, the city stands in dazzling clarity. The gentle gusts weave through the streets, coaxing residents to dress in layers\u2014a light jacket or a cozy sweater would serve well in combating the evening chill. This pleasant weather beckons you to take a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps exploring the quieter corners of the city as the sun bows out, or finding a hidden caf\u00e9 to sip on a warm beverage while the shadows lengthen and the sky transforms into shades of dusky purple and deep blue.",
