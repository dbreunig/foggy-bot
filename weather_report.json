    "weather_report": "In the still of early morning, Downtown San Francisco awakens under a blanket of partly cloudy skies, the calm offering a whisper of the day's potential. With a gentle west wind weaving through the streets, you might feel a brisk chill, echoing the cool embrace of the ocean nearby. As the sun tiptoes toward its ascent, temperatures are set to rise modestly, heralding a sunny disposition as the day unfolds, promising a high around 62 degrees. Today, the breeze will dance a little stronger, adding a playful edge that will carry the scent of salt and sea air, invigorating the spirit.\n\nAlthough fog may linger at the edges of the city, it is in retreat, leaving clarity and brightness to take its place. The absence of the notorious marine layer allows for a pleasant day ahead. As tempting as it is to don heavy attire, consider layering appropriately for the shifting breeze\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a comfortable sweater. Today invites a subtle sense of adventure. Stroll along the Embarcadero to soak in the sights or find solace in a quiet caf\u00e9, where you can sip a warm drink while watching the city come alive. Uncommitted plans and a sense of spontaneity are the themes of the day, so let the breeze guide you toward whatever pleases your mood.",
