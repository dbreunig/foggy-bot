    "weather_report": "In the serene hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco rests under a blanket of gentle clouds, with the cool air promising a refreshing embrace. The temperature languishes at around 54 degrees, accompanied by a soft southwest wind that whispers through the city\u2019s streets. As the day unfolds, the sun will rise in splendor, casting golden light upon the city, while temperatures will gradually climb to a comfortable warmth, settling near 66 degrees. By afternoon, expect a slight retreat of the heat, as the wind shifts and picks up its pace, dancing through the air with gusts that reach up to 20 mph.\n\nThe morning\u2019s quietude gives way to a delightful day, where fog remains a gentle specter, confined to the coastal edges but absent from the heart of the city. The clarity is striking; the iconic skyline you know and love will emerge crisp against the azure backdrop, inviting you to explore. A light jacket would be wise, especially in the early hours, but as noon approaches, layers will become a friend as you revel in the sun's generous warmth. A stroll through Golden Gate Park could be a lovely idea, perhaps punctuated by a visit to a nearby caf\u00e9 for a warm drink to savor as the cool breezes flow past. If you\u2019re in a creative mood, consider seeking out a quiet nook or museum to immerse yourself in the city's rich culture, making the most of this inviting day.",
