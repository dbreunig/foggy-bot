    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco stirs with a gentle respite from the often relentless fog of summer. The sky above is a soft embrace of partly cloudy night, with the temperature resting comfortably around 54 degrees. As the new day approaches, the city promises warmth and brightness, with Thursday heralding sunny skies and a high hovering near 69 degrees before drifting to 66 by afternoon. The whispers of a light southwest breeze at 5 to 12 mph mingle with the promise of sunlight, inviting those who awaken early to contemplate their day ahead.\n\nAs the sun breaks over the horizon, you might find the morning air crisp yet inviting, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps gathering a few friends for coffee at a quaint caf\u00e9 in North Beach. For those who enjoy a morning run, a light jacket will do nicely, coming off as midday warmth envelops the city. The absence of dense fog reveals the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bride, its arches stark against the enduring skyline, while the marine layer remains at bay, permitting unobstructed views and rich moments of tranquility. As the afternoon settles in, consider visiting one of the many parks, perhaps Golden Gate Park itself, for an afternoon picnic, or simply basking in the sun, making the most of this delightful summer day.",
