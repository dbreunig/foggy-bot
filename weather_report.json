    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a delicate tapestry of clouds lingers in the air, casting a muted and ethereal glow upon the city. The temperature dances around the chilly 48 degrees, with a gentle west-northwest breeze whispering at about 7 mph, hinting at the freshness that awaits in the dawn. As you contemplate the morning ahead, the promise of a sunny day beckons. By late morning, the sun will ascend to its zenith with an ambitious high of around 62 degrees, coaxing the morning chill away and inviting a comfortable warmth as the city stirs to life.\n\nAlthough the skies are currently partly cloudy, the clarity of the upcoming day suggests a remarkable opportunity for exploration. Yet, remnants of the marine layer may cloak the Golden Gate Bridge and the outer edges of the bay in a ghostly shroud, lending an air of mystery and intrigue to the iconic landscape. Dressing in layers, perhaps donning a light sweater or cardigan beneath a jacket, would serve you well as you move from the coolness of the morning to the tentative warmth of the afternoon. With such conditions, the day invites simple pleasures: a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, savoring a coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, or perhaps a quiet afternoon gallery visit, where the light will illuminate the art as well as the nearby fa\u00e7ades.",
