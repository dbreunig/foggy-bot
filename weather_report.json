    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city greets the morning with mostly clear skies and a gentle breeze. The air is crisp, with a comfortable low around 57, offering a refreshing sense of clarity as the day prepares to unfurl. The afternoon promises to bring sunny delights, with temperatures creeping up to a pleasant 73. A west-southwest wind whispers through the streets, teasing the leaves of trees and inviting folks to step outside and soak in the vibrancy of the day.\n\nThe previous evening's fog seems to have retreated, granting visibility of the renowned Golden Gate Bridge, while hints of the marine layer linger just outside the bay's embrace. It paints a gentler picture, urging a soft layer, perhaps a light sweater or a comfortable jacket as the sun rises. As you wander the inviting urban landscape, consider visiting a nearby caf\u00e9 for a leisurely breakfast, followed by a stroll along the Embarcadero. The balance of warmth and that playful breeze makes for a day ripe with possibilities as the city stirs with life.",
