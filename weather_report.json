    "weather_report": "As the twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a soft veil of clouds cloaks the city, wrapping it in a gentle embrace. While the temperature settles around a mild 57 degrees, a light wind whispers through the streets, hinting at the onset of night. Though the fog rolls in from the bay, it's wispy, caressing the Golden Gate rather than swallowing it whole. The soft glow of city lights holds a certain charm against the hazy backdrop, suggesting a calm stillness perfect for a stroll or quiet reflection. \n\nAs dawn approaches on Friday, the forecast predicts a blissful contrast; bright sunshine promises to uplift the morning. Those who venture outdoors will find warmth in a comfortable 65 degrees, perfect for a layered outfit to navigate the playful shifts in temperature throughout the day. The streets will come alive, inviting passersby to explore local cafes or maybe indulge in leisurely window shopping. Crafted coffee sips, engaging conversations with friends, or simply basking in the sunlight may just be the ticket to a perfect day in this iconic city, as the clouds gradually give way to a brilliant blue sky.",
