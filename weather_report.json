    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, a vibrant sun illuminates the streets, wrapping the city in a gentle warmth that teeters just above coolness. The air carries with it a hint of freshness, a cocktail of coastal breezes and urban vivacity. As the sun retreats, temperatures will gradually shift, embracing a more tranquil 57 degrees. A soft, west-southwest wind whispers through the buildings at around 10 mph, encouraging a leisurely stroll among the busy sidewalks.\n\nTonight, a cozy embrace of partly cloudy skies will settle over the city, offering a restful backdrop as temperatures dip into the soft 50s. The breeze lingers, inviting light layers to shield against the evening chill. For those contemplating their evening plans, consider a stroll along the waterfront or a serene visit to a quiet caf\u00e9, where the soothing sounds of the city can accompany a warm drink. The atmosphere is punctuated with the promise of a peaceful evening, ideal for winding down and savoring the simple beauty that is San Francisco in early May.",
