    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco tonight, the air carries a brisk chill, masked under a veil of clouds that blanket the sky in subdued tones. With temperatures dipping to a mild 54 degrees, a west-southwest wind dances restlessly through the streets, reaching up to 25 mph. The clouds maintain their steadfast presence, creating an ambiance that encourages comfort and coziness indoors, yet hints at the possibility of adventure for those brave enough to seek it. \n\nAs Friday unfolds, serenity appears on the horizon with promises of sunshine breaking through. The high will flirt with the mid-sixties, but onlookers will feel the temperature gently decline into late afternoon. While the wind continues its playful tussle with the city\u2019s high-rises, this weather invites layered attire\u2014a light jacket or sweater might serve as a perfect companion for an afternoon stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment spent in one of the city\u2019s charming parks. Given the interplay of clouds and sun, a thoughtful cup of coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9 could very well complement the experience, allowing one to savor the nuances of San Francisco's ever-changing skies.",
