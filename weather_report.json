    "weather_report": "The dawn in Downtown San Francisco unfurls with a sense of calm, though a slight drizzle flickers through the night air, gently reminding us of the city's typical embrace of moisture. The clouds blanket the sky, offering a muted palette as temperatures linger around a cool 55 degrees. Winds whisper softly from the west, carrying hints of the ocean's salty breath, with only the faintest chance of rain uncertainly hovering in the atmosphere.\n\nAs Monday unfolds, there's a promise of brighter skies, as the drizzle gives way to a tentative sun. The day will warm to about 64 degrees, although there's a gentle decline into the afternoon chill. While the sun tries to assert itself, clouds may still cling stubbornly, and a light breeze will coax you to bring a light jacket or a cozy sweater when venturing outdoors.\n\nGiven the mildness of the day, it is an ideal time to indulge in leisurely walks along the waterfront. Perhaps find a quiet bench to sit with a cup of coffee and observe the diffuse light skimming over the water, or wander through the nearby parks, where the crisp air invigorates the spirit. As the marine layer lingers, it\u2019s a gentle reminder of San Francisco's unique, often enigmatic character.",
