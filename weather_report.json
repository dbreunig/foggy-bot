    "weather_report": "As the evening air settles over Downtown San Francisco, a delicate blanket of patchy fog begins its slow crawl, hinting at the transition to a new day. The night sky, though mostly clear, whispers of cool temperatures as we drift down to a comfortable 49 degrees. The west wind offers a gentle caress, stirring softly at 5 to 8 mph, allowing the city to breathe in tranquility before dawn breaks.\n\nCome Sunday, the fog will intertwine with the morning light, giving way to a winning blend of patches of sunlight that warm the streets and awaken spirits. With a high reaching toward 66 before easing back to around 64, it promises a day suitable for leisurely strolls through the neighborhoods or perhaps a quiet cup of coffee enjoyed al fresco. The south southwest wind, though light, will escort the whispers of the marine layer, outlining where the cool ocean air meets the vibrant life of the city. On such a day, layers are advisable; a light jacket or cardigan paired with comfortable attire will offer the flexibility to enjoy both the sunshine and the lingering breeze, whether one wanders along the waterfront or explores the eclectic shops downtown. \n\nAs sunset approaches, consider taking a saunter through the Mission District or indulging in a quiet moment at a park bench, watching the city shift from day to night, the fog resting lightly over the bay, a reminder of the charm that lingers in this extraordinary urban tapestry.",
