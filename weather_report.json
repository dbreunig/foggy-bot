    "weather_report": "As the twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, the city is wrapped in a gentle embrace of clouds, with hints of the ocean's breath weaving through the evening. The low temperature of about 56 degrees suggests a refreshing chill, making it wise to layer up\u2014think comfortable hoodies or light jackets to guard against the cool whispers of the west-southwest winds which occasionally gusts up to 18 mph. This calm yet brisk ambiance is complemented by a blend of partly sunny skies set to emerge in the early morrow, promising a gradual warming as you approach the day\u2019s zenith at around 64 degrees.\n\nTonight, the marine layer blankets the bay in a soft haze, with fog likely nestling around the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and beyond. It might obscure the distant skyline, but this very obscurity adds a layer of mystery, inviting one to wander the streets beneath the historic architecture with a cup of steaming coffee. Tomorrow, as the sun peeks through, the city will awaken to a soft light that bathes its hills and coastal vistas, offering a perfect backdrop for leisurely strolls or perhaps an afternoon in the local park, where the freshness of the air will invigorate the senses. Whether it is a quiet night spent indoors watching the world glide by or an invitation to join friends at a caf\u00e9, the atmosphere holds the promise of simple pleasures richly adorned by the charm of San Francisco's night.",
