    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a tapestry of mostly sunny skies, though the clarity seems somewhat muted by the whispers of a lingering marine layer. The high approaches mid-fifties, inviting the need for a light jacket or sweater as the temperatures gently dip into the afternoon. A soft west wind meanders through the streets, providing a touch of briskness that invigorates the senses while the horizon plays host to the subtle dance of clouds lingering near the Golden Gate.\n\nAs evening beckons, the skies promise a shift, retreating into a cloak of mostly cloudy conditions with a low settling around forty-nine. Those venturing out might find comfort in layers, perhaps a scarf or hat as the day transitions to night and the air grows cooler. With the forecast's mix of sun and cloud, the urban landscape calls for a walk through the neighborhoods, a stop for a cozy coffee, or perhaps a quiet wander by the waterfront, where the beauty of the Bay remains ever enchanting, enveloped by the gentle fog that enriches this city's character.",
