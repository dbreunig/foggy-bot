    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle embrace of partly sunny skies, the kind that brushes against your cheeks with a cool caress. A hint of breeze dances through the streets, invigorating passersby with its crispness, while the high of 63 degrees invites light layers. The city, vibrant yet serene, embodies the classic charm of summer evenings by the bay, although hints of an impending marine layer linger as a reminder of the fog\u2019s ever-watchful presence.\n\nAs twilight descends, a subtle shift signals the potential arrival of a slight drizzle come morning, a soft whisper between the clouds, with temperatures dipping into the 50s. The atmosphere, blanketed in a gentle melancholy, hints at the fragrant promise of fresh rain. For those wandering the bustling streets, perhaps a light jacket is wise, perfect for enjoying the flicker of city lights and the enticing aroma from nearby cafes. The calm before nightfall offers an ideal backdrop for a stroll by the waterfront or a leisurely visit to an art gallery, absorbing the energy wrapped in layers of history and ambiance.",
