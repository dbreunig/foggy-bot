    "weather_report": "As the night drapes gently over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a quiet promise of moisture, with a hint of drizzle anticipated after dawn. It\u2019s a predominantly cloudy canvas that holds a cool stillness, embracing the city with a low of around 57 degrees. A soft west-southwest breeze meanders through the streets, whispering in rhythm with the distant sounds of the waking world.\n\nMorning will bring a fleeting chance of drizzle before transitioning to a blend of sun and clouds, promising a respite as the sun makes an appearance to brighten the day. Expect temperatures to rise lightly, peaking near 65 before ebbing to a cooler afternoon of approximately 63. The wind will pick up slightly, teasing apart the remaining clouds, while the 20 mph gusts will stir the leaves, creating an inviting atmosphere for some light outdoor exploration. With the marine layer subtle yet present on the outskirts, those venturing out may find the Golden Gate cloaked in mist, a stunning contrast against the clearer city expanse.\n\nFor a day like this, a light jacket would be a wise companion, layering comfortably over a breathable top, ready for the embrace of the brisk wind when wandering through the streets or sipping coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9. Perhaps an early stroll along Embarcadero would beckon; the air carrying the scent of salt and the promise of new beginnings, mingling harmoniously with a quiet moment to watch the city wake up. Alternatively, a leisurely visit to a nearby gallery or bookstore can provide a cozy sanctuary, allowing both thought and creativity to flow on this gentle San Francisco morning.",
