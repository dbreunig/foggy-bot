    "weather_report": "As dawn stretches over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries whispers of a gentle warmth, though the skyline is shrouded in the soft embrace of clouds that linger like old friends. The sun attempts to break through, promising a high of around 65 degrees, while the west southwest winds play a lively tune, rustling through the streets at speeds that can reach a spirited 24 mph. Fog has been coaxed back for now, revealing the outlines of the city and the heavenly heights of the Golden Gate Bridge, yet it may still tiptoe back in as the sun begins its retreat this afternoon.\n\nTonight, the clouds will deepen in hue as they gather together, creating an atmosphere perfect for a quiet evening stroll. Expect temperatures to dip to a mellow 57 degrees, accompanied by a steady wind that insists on keeping you pleasantly aware of the evening chill. It would be wise to layer up\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket over a casual shirt, and certainly comfortable shoes for wandering along the waterfront or exploring one of the many hidden nooks of the city. As the warmth of the day transitions to a cooler night, consider dining at a cozy bistro or finding a bench in a nearby park to watch the illuminated skyline reflect upon the shimmering bay.",
