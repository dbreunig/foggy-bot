    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city finds itself cloaked in a shroud of cloud and potential rain, a reminder of the city's often capricious temperament. The air is cool and suggests a certain dampness, as spotty rain earlier in the morning gives way to showers and thunderstorms. The forecast hints at a high of 56, not quite warm enough to shed layers entirely, though the brisk west wind rustles through the streets with an eagerness that belies the day's moody beginnings. \n\nBy tonight, the clouds will part slightly, leaving a clearer night enriched by the chill of the sea breeze. With temperatures dipping to around 46, dressing in layers becomes paramount\u2014think cozy sweaters, a waterproof jacket, and perhaps a comforting scarf to ward off the briskness. As the day unfolds under gray skies, consider indoor delights: a visit to the city's eclectic museums, a quiet coffee shop to savor a book, or a leisurely stroll through the fog-muted streets, where the historic buildings stand sentinel against the shifting weather. Though the shadows of rain may linger, so too do the whispers of adventure awaiting those willing to embrace the day\u2019s charms.",
