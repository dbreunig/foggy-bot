    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of gentle clouds whispers softly above, the kind that drapes the city in a muted embrace. With temperatures tonight dipping to the comfortable mid-fifties, the air holds onto that cool, familiar breath characteristic of our coastal climate. Come Sunday, the sun will lift its shroud, unfolding mostly sunny skies, yet the breeze will still flirt with your sleeves \u2014 a steady west-southwest wind greets the day, playing between twelve to eighteen miles per hour, occasionally teasing with gusts that dance around twenty-three.\n\nCurrently, the horizon shows hints of the marine layer, a ghostly fog lingering along the bay, perhaps discreetly wrapping its fingers around the Golden Gate. The visibility remains fair, promising clarity as the sun rises higher, gradually illuminating the quintessential San Francisco landscape. On days such as these, when the fog reluctantly yields to sunlit paths, attire with layers is the sensible choice; a light jacket will serve you well against the intermittent chill while you wander along the waterfront or sip coffee in one of the city\u2019s intimate caf\u00e9s. As the world awakens, it beckons you to explore the quieter streets, perhaps taking in the lilting sounds of a nearby street musician, or simply relishing in the gentle harmony of urban life finding its rhythm anew.",
