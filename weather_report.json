    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere reveals itself in gentle clarity, with a soft chill that embraces the city. With the temperature settling around 49 degrees, the air holds a light breeze whispering from the south, gradually weaving through the streets. The skyline is subtly illuminated by scattered city lights, offering a serene contrast against the starlit backdrop. The promise of a clear night suggests that any lingering fog has receded for now, leaving the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and surrounding hills to stand boldly against the dark canvas.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, a crisp and predominantly sunny day awaits, the high nearing a comfortable 62 degrees. Gentle southwest winds will accompany the daylight, making it an inviting time for leisurely strolls through the green spaces or perhaps a quiet moment on a caf\u00e9 patio, where you might enjoy the interplay of warmth and a light layer of clothing. A light jacket or sweater could be ideal, offering just enough comfort as day morphs into the cool of evening. The ambiance is one that encourages simple pleasures\u2014meandering through art galleries, exploring hidden bookshops, or savoring a quiet lunch where the flavors intertwine with the ease of a sunny afternoon.",
