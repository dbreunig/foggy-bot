    "weather_report": "As the sun begins to rise over Downtown San Francisco, an elusive veil of mist persists, enveloping the city in a gentle embrace. The morning chill brings with it whispers of rain that faded before 11 AM, leaving behind a canvas of pale blue skies punctuated by patches of white clouds. With temperatures hovering near the mid-50s and a subtle west-southwest wind weaving through the streets, the day invites brisk strolls along the Embarcadero or leisurely coffee breaks at cozy caf\u00e9s. The forecast suggests a modest chance of rain may return, but for now, the damp air is refreshing rather than oppressive, inviting a sense of calm as the city comes alive.\n\nTonight, the atmosphere promises to shift as the clouds roll in once more, settling down to a cooler 50 degrees. The west-northwest winds continue their gentle caress, urging locals to perhaps grab a light jacket as they head out for an evening walk or to enjoy a quiet meal outdoors. The unpredictability of the weather, with its delicate balance between sun and shadow, beckons residents to savor the present moment, embracing the mild playfulness of spring in this enchanting city.",
