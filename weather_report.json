    "weather_report": "As the night wraps Downtown San Francisco in a gentle embrace, the sky wears a shroud of clouds, casting a soft glow over the city. With a cool breeze stirring, the warmth of the day slips into a subtle chill that nudges you to reach for a light jacket. The temperature hovers around 57 degrees, a reminder of the city's penchant for keeping things refreshingly crisp. As dawn approaches, there\u2019s a subtle promise of brightness; tomorrow hints at fleeting moments of sunshine, with temperatures reaching for the mid-sixties but softening into the low sixties as the afternoon wanes. The winds will add a touch of liveliness, gusting through the streets at their peak.\n\nThe fog, a faithful companion to the city, is likely to linger along the coast, perhaps lending a mystical air to the Golden Gate. Expect the air to remain clear downtown, perfect for an afternoon stroll, where the iconic skyline becomes a backdrop for a day spent in casual exploration. Dress in layers to navigate this delightful interplay of coolness and warmth; perhaps a light scarf would add a touch of class while being practical. Take this opportunity to wander through the local markets or settle into a cozy caf\u00e9 with a warm cup of coffee, savoring the ambiance that only a San Francisco morning can provide.",
