The temperature whispers around fifty-two degrees, inviting a light sweater or a cozy jacket to fend off the evening chill. The west-southwest winds dance lightly, carrying the scent of the bay, brushing past at three to twelve miles per hour, a mere caress from the horizon. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, a bright invitation awaits as the sun emerges with promises of a clear sky, peeking down upon the city\u2019s iconic skyline. It\u2019s expected to crest at around sixty-six before the afternoon softens the warmth to a more mellow sixty-four. A southwest breeze may sweep through stronger, brushing the day with more vigor as it climbs to eighteen mph, perhaps ruffling a few coats as people stroll along the waterfront. While the fog may still linger in the early hours\u2014a familiar resident this time of year\u2014its presence will give way to clarity, allowing for wonderful views of the Golden Gate and beyond. Tomorrow beckons to wanderers: a visit to one of the city's open-air markets, or perhaps a leisurely walk through the park, where the flowers bloom in tandem with the sun. Remember to dress in layers; embrace the morning chill but savor the warmth of the afternoon sun when it gifts us its radiant glow.",
