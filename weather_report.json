    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon presents a pleasant tableau of mostly sunny skies, with wisps of cloud lazily drifting by as the temperature hovers near a comfortable 64 degrees. A refreshing west wind whispers through the streets with a briskness that dances at 21 mph, the gusts occasionally swelling to 26 mph, inviting those who revel in the invigorating embrace of fresh air to step outside. While the current clarity hints at an open day, the iconic fog may still linger at the peripheries, perhaps snuggling against the Golden Gate in its delicate, shrouded way, hinting that typical coastal nuances are never too far. \n\nAs night descends, the charm continues with partly cloudy skies and a low settling around 56\u2014perfect for a lightweight sweater or a light jacket. The evening air, kissed by the gentle west winds, ushers in just the right chill to encourage strolls along the Embarcadero, where the twinkling lights of the city reflect on the water, or perhaps a quiet reading in a cozy caf\u00e9, surrounded by the scent of freshly brewed coffee. Embrace the simplicity of a leisurely walk along the waterfront, where the air is filled with the smells of the ocean mingling with the city's heartbeat, offering a chance to enjoy the warm hues of dusk against the cool evening backdrop.",
