With temperatures tenderly dropping to around 50, the air carries a crispness that invites a light jacket\u2014an embrace against the cool, whispering winds that pulse softly from the southwest. \n\nAs the dawn breaks on Thursday, the promise of a sunny day beckons with highs near 65, dipping slightly to about 62 as the afternoon unfolds. The southwest winds will dance lightly through the streets, occasionally gusting up to 23 mph, lending a vibrant energy to the sun's warm rays. While the morning may greet us with the lingering kisses of a faint marine layer, it is destined to dissipate, leaving behind a canvas of blue, bright and inviting. Dress comfortably but wisely; a layering of light fabrics will serve well in the shifting temperatures. With such splendid weather, it would be delightful to take a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps stop by a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm cup while soaking in the sounds and sights of an awakening city.",
