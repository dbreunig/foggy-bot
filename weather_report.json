    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity blankets the city. The air, crisp and cool, carries an invigorating whisper from the west-northwest, nudging temperatures down to a comfortable 46 degrees. The evening sky appears mostly clear, punctuated occasionally by stars twinkling through the darkness, painting an inviting scene for nighttime wanderers. The wispy marine layer, typical for this coastal enclave, seems to hold its breath, keeping the fog at bay for now.\n\nTomorrow promises a welcome sunlit embrace as the daylight unfolds. With a expected high around 60, residents can anticipate a cheerful gleam, tempered by a light breeze of 2 to 12 mph. It's an ideal setting for a leisurely morning stroll along crisscrossed streets, perhaps leading to a quaint caf\u00e9 for coffee or a pastry. Curate your attire wisely for the day\u2014layers will serve you well, as the morning chill gives way to the warmth of the afternoon sun. A light jacket or sweater paired with comfortable walking shoes will prepare you for whatever adventures lie ahead in the vibrant tapestry of this city.",
