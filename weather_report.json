    "weather_report": "As the morning sun begins to weave its golden thread through the crisp San Francisco air, the city awakens to a pleasant warmth, with temperatures hovering around 69 degrees. The blue sky stretches out like an artist's canvas, unmarred by clouds, hinting at the soft shadow of the hills and the Golden Gate Bridge peeking through. Wind whispers through the streets, its gentle caress cool yet refreshing, carrying the promise of a delightful day. \n\nAs the afternoon approaches and the sun dips a bit, temperatures will gracefully settle near 67. Tonight, the air will entwine into a cooler ambiance, blanketed by partly cloudy skies and a tranquil low of around 59. Dress comfortably\u2014a light jacket may be in order for the evening strolls. With the clarity above, it\u2019s an ideal time for a leisurely walk along the waterfront or to savor a quaint moment at a nearby caf\u00e9, basking in the late sun\u2019s warmth before the evening draws near. If you\u2019re inclined, now is the time to explore the hidden gems of Downtown, as the city hums with life and the pulse of its streets invites you to experience something new.",
