    "weather_report": "As the afternoon gives way to evening in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is a mix of warm tranquility and gentle anticipation. The sun hangs low in a clear sky, casting a soft golden light that dances along the buildings, edging closer toward the cool embrace of twilight. With a high near 65, the day has offered a pleasant respite from the usual chills, though a subtle breeze whispers through the streets, encouraging the curious to seek out lighter layers.\n\nAs night approaches, the clouds begin to gather, bringing with them the promise of patchy drizzle after 2 a.m. Tonight's low settles around 55, accented by a mild wind from the southwest\u2014a tender reminder of the marine layer that shyly hugs the coastline, retreating from the city's embrace for now. While fog may linger at the fringes, it is absent at this hour, allowing for an unobstructed view of the sparkling city lights. \n\nFor those seeking evening engagement, the light still proposes delightful strolls along the waterfront. Cozy caf\u00e9s beckon with the warmth of freshly brewed coffee, perfect for enjoying the gentle sounds of the city settling down. Opt for a light jacket to navigate the cool breeze and be ready to embrace the soft moisture hinting at the night ahead.",
