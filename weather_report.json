    "weather_report": "As the night deepens, most of San Francisco is gently cloaked in a soft veil of clouds, with the air rich and cool, lingering around a soothing 54 degrees. A light southwest breeze whispers through the streets, hinting at the warmth that tomorrow promises. As dawn approaches, the sunlight will gradually pierce through the haze, casting a golden glow across the cityscape. By mid-morning, the sky will clear, liberating those sun-soaked rays to envelop the city in a pleasant embrace. By mid-afternoon, expect a comfortable high of near 70, though the heat will gracefully dip back, leaving the day pleasantly mild, accentuated by calm winds from the northwest.\n\nShould you wander outdoors, it is wise to dress in layers; a light jacket coupled with a breathable shirt will serve you well, as the day begins cool before transforming into a warm tableau of sunshine. Perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet sit at a downtown caf\u00e9 will feel just right; sipping a warm cup while observing the slow beat of city life unfolding. For those who seek a bit of adventure, a brief hike on the trails around the Golden Gate will unveil breathtaking vistas that every local cherishes. The fog may find its way out of the bay, evoking the ethereal beauty of a city perpetually in dialogue with the sea, so venture forth and revel in the delicate balance between the chill of the marine layer and the warm embrace of the sun.",
