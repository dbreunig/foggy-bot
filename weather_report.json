    "weather_report": "As the sun rises gently over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a mostly sunny morning that promises to be a day for enjoying the outdoors. Highs are expected to hover around 63 degrees, with a gradual descent toward the afternoon, where the temperature will rest comfortably near 60. A light southwest breeze dances through the streets, whispering of warmer moments ahead. \n\nWhile the forecast speaks of clarity, a hint of the iconic maritime layer may linger, softening the skyline and cloaking the more distant views in a delicate embrace of fog. Those venturing out will find this a pleasant day for a stroll through the vibrant streets, perhaps visiting a quaint caf\u00e9 or wandering to one of the nearby parks to bask in the sunlight. For dress, layers will be your ally; a light sweater or a soft jacket will provide comfort against the coolness that often accompanies the ocean air, especially as evening approaches and temperatures dip to around 50. Consider indulging in the simple pleasure of a late morning coffee, perhaps outdoors, while watching the world move at its own pace, before the fog rolls in to soften the edges of the day.",
