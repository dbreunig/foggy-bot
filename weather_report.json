    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a soft patch of drizzle whispers through the air, nurturing the city in its gauzy embrace. With temperatures settling around a gentle 59 degrees, the west-southwest wind carries a calming cadence, rustling through the trees and weaving tales of the Pacific. While the chance of a sprinkling is just a whisper at 20%, the character of the night feels amiable, wrapped in partly cloudy sheets that may subtly reveal the stars. \n\nCome morning, the drizzle will yield to moments of sunshine, revealing the city's landmarks against a tranquil backdrop. With temperatures expected to reach a pleasant 67 degrees under a broadening expanse of blue, the day holds the promise of exploration. The winds will pick up slightly, whispering between 8 and 20 mph, creating a delightful environment for a stroll. As the marine layer's fleeting presence clears, dress in layers to greet the warmth yet hold onto a light jacket for the wind\u2019s playful dance. This weather invites a relaxed coffee by a window, a leisurely stroll through Mission District's vibrant streets, or perhaps simply enjoying the tranquil beauty of a short hike on nearby trails, where nature and the city intertwine seamlessly.",
