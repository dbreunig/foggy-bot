    "weather_report": "As the evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a chill that whispers of impending rain. The skies are predominantly veiled in gray, a thick blanket of clouds draping over the city like a muted shawl. With darkened horizons hinting at moisture, the chance of rain looms at thirty percent; one might find comfort in a light jacket, perhaps a waterproof layer for the unpredictable drizzle that could punctuate tonight's quiet ambiance. A gentle west wind meanders through the streets, nudging the temperature down to a cool fifty degrees, providing a momentary respite from the bustling daytime warmth.\n\nSunday promises a dance of sun and clouds, with the gentle touch of sunlight trying to break through the veil. As the day unfolds, one can expect a high near fifty-nine, an invitation to emerge from cozy interiors. The sky may reveal its blue hues intermittently, offering glimpses of clarity amidst patches of lingering cloud cover. Dress in layers to navigate the shifting weather; a light sweater over a comfortable shirt should serve well for the day\u2019s strolls. A leisurely walk through one of the city\u2019s less-traveled parks, or perhaps a visit to a cozy cafe, might reveal the simple joys of a San Francisco Sunday, all while savoring the city's unique charm under the watchful gaze of the fog.",
