    "weather_report": "The night air in Downtown San Francisco carries with it the subtle scent of impending rain, a soft embrace of coolness that wraps around you like an old friend. Currently, the city lies beneath a blanket of clouds, which dim the flickering lights and create a serene, almost melancholic atmosphere. As the clock inches into the early hours, the low temperature hovers around 52 degrees, accompanied by a gentle south-southwest breeze, barely stirring the leaves in the trees that line the streets. With a 40% chance of rain, one might consider keeping an umbrella nearby, though for now, the rain remains a whisper on the wind.\n\nAs morning unfurls, expect a significant shift, as rain transforms from a mere possibility to a certainty, looming with a 90% chance. The high will settle near 57 degrees, a mild chill that beckons the layers\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater paired with a water-resistant jacket. The south winds may gust with a playful force, so a sturdy hat wouldn\u2019t go amiss. The day ahead may not seem most inviting for leisurely strolls along the waterfront, but it offers a chance to savor the indoor delights of the city. A visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of coffee, or perhaps an afternoon indulging in the artistic treasures housed within a nearby gallery would enhance the experience of a city softly embracing its winter weather.",
