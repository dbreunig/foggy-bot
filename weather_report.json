    "weather_report": "In the quiet embrace of the night, Downtown San Francisco is cloaked in a serene clarity, the sky unobstructed by fog, a pristine expanse that promises the dawn of a beautiful day. As the local time gently nudges into early morning, the chill of the air hangs lightly, reminiscent of the calm before a vibrant sunrise. The low 44 degrees ushers in an atmosphere of crispness, a reminder of the city\u2019s characteristic coolness even as the night begins to yield to day.\n\nBy Tuesday, the sun will decide to show its face, bestowing warmth and brightness upon the city as temperatures ascend toward a pleasant high of 57. A gentle northwest breeze will accompany this uplift, whispering through the streets, inviting locals and visitors alike to step outside. The day calls for layers\u2014a light jacket over a comfortable sweater would serve well, protecting against the remnants of evening coolness while remaining breathable enough for the approaching warmth. It is a day that beckons one to explore\u2014perhaps a stroll along the waterfront, where the morning light reflecting off the bay creates a painting worth admiring, or a cozy visit to a neighborhood caf\u00e9 to savor the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee, while observing the city waking, vibrant and alive.",
