    "weather_report": "As the night deepens, a gentle veil of clouds rolls over Downtown San Francisco, punctuated by the distant whisper of rain. The soft warmth, hovering around fifty-four degrees, beckons a light sweater or a cozy jacket to wrap around oneself before stepping outside. The breeze carries a slight chill from the south-southwest, offering a reminder that spring nights can be dalliance between warmth and cool. With the forecast hinting at a forty percent chance of precipitation, the air feels alive, charged with that anticipatory energy before rain.\n\nTomorrow unfolds with a promise of intermittent sunshine, yet the clouds may linger, stretching the horizon with their gray, brooding presence. Expect temperatures to settle in the low sixties, dipping slightly in the afternoon, which calls for layering: a light shirt under a warmer outer layer could serve you well as the winds pick up. A stroll along the Embarcadero or through Golden Gate Park could perfectly complement this dynamic weather. Enjoy the brisk air, perhaps stopping for a warm drink at your favorite caf\u00e9 as raindrops tap softly against the pavement. It\u2019s a day that whispers of discovery and tranquility, wrapped in the curious embrace of San Francisco's ever-changing climate.",
