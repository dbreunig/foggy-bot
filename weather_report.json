The air is soft and cool, resting at about 56 degrees, with a hint of moisture lingering\u2014a slight chance of drizzle remains in the atmosphere. The southwest wind quietly meanders through the city, offering whispers of fresh air, though it may feel bracing against the skin as the day gradually unfolds.\n\nAs the sun begins its ascent, hints of brightness may peek through the cloudy veil, beckoning a transformation to a partly sunny afternoon. The temperature is expected to rise softly, reaching near 63, and then gently dip again to around 61 as the day progresses. Residents and visitors should dress in layers, perhaps opting for a lightweight sweater or a light jacket, anticipating the cool breeze. For those who seek placid activities today, a meandering stroll along the waterfront could be delightful, with the famed Golden Gate, though perhaps a touch shrouded, still standing proud as a beacon of beauty. Alternatively, delightful caf\u00e9s await those in search of warmth and comfort\u2014perhaps enjoying a leisurely breakfast while savoring the unique charm of this city, transformed into an artful blend of mist and cloud.",
