    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, today unfurls under a blanket of brilliant sunshine, brightening the streets with a warm glow. The high temperature nudges around 70 degrees, inviting residents and visitors alike to embrace the outdoors. The gentle northwest breeze, weaving through the city's iconic streets, offers a refreshing touch, softening the warmth into something delightful. As the hours drift towards afternoon, the temperature will settle closer to a comfortable 68, signaling a perfect time to step outside.\n\nTonight, as the sun dips below the horizon, the sky will transition to a clear canvas dotted with stars, offering a tranquil respite from the day's vibrancy. Expect the air to cool down to around 52 degrees, gentle enough to wear light layers while stargazing or wandering the waterfront. While the presence of fog is minimal today, there remains a whisper of the marine layer lingering just beyond the Golden Gate, accentuating the picturesque view. To make the most of this splendid day, consider an afternoon stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping at a cozy caf\u00e9 or a lively market, where the charm of the city truly comes to life. A light jacket would suffice when the evening draws near, wrapping you in comforting warmth as you soak in the serene atmosphere of early spring.",
