The clouds drape themselves over the skyline with a certain elegance, creating a soft, muted palette of grays. The marine layer, a familiar companion to this coastal enclave, hangs low yet respectful, hinting at the fog's presence, though not entirely engulfing the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate.\n\nTomorrow dawns with a promise of partly sunny skies and a high near sixty, ushering in a day that feels inviting despite the lingering coolness. As the sun breaks through the clouds, it transforms the city, casting long shadows and illuminating the vibrant streets, beckoning residents to venture outside. In these conditions, layering is sensible\u2014a light jacket over a comfortable shirt should suffice, allowing for the mildness of the afternoon sun while still accommodating the cool evening air as it returns.
