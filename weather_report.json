    "weather_report": "As night falls in Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in a serene expanse of mostly clear skies. The air, kissed by a gentle breeze from the west, carries a crispness that hints at the cooler temperatures, settling to around 51 degrees. Underneath this celestial canvas, the familiar silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and the rolling hills emerge, framed by the faintest whisper of marine layer clinging to the fringes, suggesting a dance with the fog that often graces this coastal paradise.\n\nAwakening to Sunday, the forecast bathes the city in warmth, predicting sun-drenched hours with temperatures climbing near 66 degrees. It\u2019s the kind of day that invites you to partake in life\u2019s quieter joys \u2013 perhaps a leisurely walk down to the waterfront or a quiet moment spent in one of the many parks, soaking up the vitamin D while enjoying the subtle sounds of the bustling city. With winds brushing through at a comfortable pace, dressing in light layers will serve you well; a light sweater to counter the chill of the evening, but nothing too cumbersome, as the sunlight beckons for a touch of warmth on your skin. Engage in your day, whether it's exploring new corners of the city or sipping coffee at a sunlit caf\u00e9 terrace, embracing the clarity that this splendid day offers.",
