    "weather_report": "As the sun stretches its rays over Downtown San Francisco, today greets us with a glorious expanse of sunshine. The air is pleasantly warm, brushing against the skin with gentle touches that speak of summer while cooling off just enough to keep the bay\u2019s spirit alive. With a high nearing seventies, the atmosphere invites you to step outside, where a soft south-southwest breeze dances through the streets, caressing city dwellers as they go about their morning rituals. \n\nThough clarity reigns today, whispers of a marine layer linger just offshore, hinting at the city\u2019s playful relationship with fog. Yet, as daylight unfolds, the likelihood of it creeping inland grows slimmer, making way for a bright day perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping for a coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or simply soaking in the vibrant life of the waterfront. In the evening, a clear sky remains, with the coolness settling into the 50s, beckoning light layers or a comfortable jacket for those harboring romantic notions of twilight. \n\nWith the promise of warmth enveloped in the embrace of a breezy afternoon, today unfolds as a delightful tapestry of experiences waiting for you to explore.",
