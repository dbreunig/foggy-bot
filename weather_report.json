    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a radiant sun bathes the city in a gentle warmth, momentarily chasing off the shadows of the morning mist. The high temperature hovers around sixty-six degrees, tapering slightly into the afternoon. A light breeze from the west-southwest carries whispers of sea air\u2014perfect for those who find solace in the ocean's embrace. However, despite the sun's presence, hints of cloudiness begin to gather, signaling the approach of a cooler evening.\n\nTonight, a curtain of mostly cloudy skies will drape itself over the bay, with temperatures settling near fifty-seven degrees. The wind will ease, creating an inviting atmosphere as the day transitions into the evening. As for attire, layering remains paramount; a light sweater or a casual jacket would be ideal for embracing the delightful chill as you stroll along the waterfront or perhaps venture into one of the city's renowned eateries.\n\nWith such pleasant conditions and the idyllic late afternoon sun, consider meandering through the historic neighborhoods of the Mission or North Beach. You might find yourself at a quaint caf\u00e9, sampling local brews or perhaps indulging in a leisurely read at a sun-dappled park. Whatever you choose, let the city's vibrant spirit accompany you as you savor this beautiful day.",
