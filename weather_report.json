    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere remains gently veiled with an ethereal hush, laced with the moan of a westerly breeze. The sky, partly cloaked in a mild darkness, hints at the lingering presence of fog, though the peaks of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge stand resolute against this subdued embrace. With a low temperature settling around 52 degrees, the air carries a refreshing chill, invigorating yet soft enough to coax the soul into quiet reflection.\n\nAs dawn breaks, a vibrant sun will usher in a day marked by the promise of clear skies, with temperatures reaching a pleasant zenith near 62, drifting down toward a cozy 60 as the afternoon unfolds. The southwestern winds will dance through the streets, briskly tugging at jackets worn in evening\u2019s cool embrace, so a light sweater or a well-tailored coat may serve you well if you venture outside early on. The city\u2019s charm emerges distinctly under the brightening sky, as residents can meander through Golden Gate Park, savoring the fragrance of blooming flowers carried by the light breeze, or indulge in an early afternoon stroll along the Embarcadero, the waters glimmering like a pathway to infinite possibilities. It is a day reflecting the delicate balance of tranquility and vibrancy, an invitation to seize the moment as the city awakens to its luminous potential.",
