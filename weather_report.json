    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the evening sky is draped in a soft veil of clouds, the horizon blurring gently as the twilight deepens. A cool breeze meanders through the streets, carrying the crispness of the ocean air with it and whispering promises of a refreshing night ahead. The temperature hovers around a mild 52 degrees, inviting you to consider a light jacket or a cozy sweater, perfect for a stroll along the waterfront or a quiet dinner in a nearby caf\u00e9. \n\nAs the night unfolds, the marine layer clings to the shore, occasionally lifting just enough to reveal hints of the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance, a reminder of the breathtaking beauty that defines this city. Tomorrow promises a partly sunny respite, with highs touching 61, as the sun makes its way across a backdrop of light clouds. This could be the ideal moment to wander through the parks or enjoy a leisurely coffee on a sunlit terrace, watching the city awaken. A day filled with potential lies ahead, framed by the soft hues of maritime clouds and the promise of a clear sky, a dance of light and air where the ordinary feels distinctly extraordinary.",
