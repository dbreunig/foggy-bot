    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks past one in the afternoon, the air in Downtown San Francisco holds a hint of dampness, the remnants of last night's patchy drizzle lingering in the atmosphere. The sky is cloaked in a quilt of clouds, casting a muted gray light across the city\u2019s iconic landscape. Visibility feels slightly obscured, shadowing the Golden Gate Bridge with an ethereal veil, while the bay\u2019s gentle waves sport a delicate shimmer under the faint sun attempting to pierce through. A cool wind stirs from the west, rustling the leaves of the trees lining the streets, making light jackets the smart choice for any stroll outside.\n\nLooking ahead, the weather promises a gradual lift; the drizzle will ease, giving way to moments of sunshine as the day progresses. Temperatures are expected to hover in a cool embrace, inviting a leisurely afternoon. For those venturing out, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink would be fitting, especially as the winds pick up. An easy walk along the Embarcadero, feeling the breeze and taking in the sights of the water, could be a satisfying way to spend the rest of the day. Attire should be practical yet comfortable, perhaps with layers to adapt to the shifting moods of San Francisco's oft-unpredictable weather.",
