    "weather_report": "A gentle veil of morning mist lingers over Downtown San Francisco, whispering of the potential for a light drizzle before daybreak lifts its rays. The day is set to evolve into a predominantly sunny affair, with temperatures inching toward a comfortable 64 degrees. The whispers of the wind, soft yet distinct, will carry the scent of the bay, making an afternoon stroll feel pleasantly breezy. As the sun rises higher, expect the clouds to dissipate, revealing the splendid architecture of the city against a backdrop of blue skies.\n\nWith a hint of marine layer hovering near the Golden Gate, a light fog may grace the edges of the bay. Yet, for the most part, clarity reigns supreme, casting a delightful glow on the world below. A light jacket or sweater will serve as a comforting layer against the coolness of the early hours, especially as evening approaches and clouds circulate, preparing to bring about just a whisper of drizzle. With such splendid weather, one might find joy in a peaceful walk through the vibrant gardens of Golden Gate Park, or perhaps a quiet moment spent sipping coffee at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, savoring the chill of the air before the evening settles in.",
