    "weather_report": "The dawn in Downtown San Francisco unfolds quietly under a blanket of moisture-laden clouds, a gentle tease of drizzle resting lightly on the city's shoulders. The temperature lingers in the mid-fifties, carried by a west-southwest wind that whispers through the streets at a brisk pace. Today, the sun promises to break through the haze, though it will take its time to rise, resulting in a cool but increasingly clear afternoon, with highs gently peaking around sixty-four degrees before gracefully sliding back towards sixty-one.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, one might notice hints of fog twirling around the Golden Gate, teasing the eye with fleeting glimpses of the bridge. The marine layer is yet to fully surrender to the advancing day, offering a soft embrace that enhances the city's familiar contours, though clarity will sweep in later. Dressing in layers would be prudent, with a light jacket and a touch of warmth exploring the chilly morning air, before shedding those for a more comfortable attire as the sun begins its ascent, inviting brief forays into parks or art galleries, perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero as the day warms. Enjoy this gentle shift from the cozy indoors to the inviting outside, and savor the juxtaposition of cool concrete and warmer sun.",
