    "weather_report": "As the early hours of dawn give way in Downtown San Francisco, a soft veil of cloud thins across the sky, hinting at a day that could flirt with rain but ultimately leans toward the sun. The air is cool, cradled in the embrace of a 52-degree chill. A gentle breeze whispers through the streets, rustling the leaves and carrying with it the remnants of yesterday's fog\u2014a marine layer that has not yet surrendered fully to the day. The chance of rain lingers, a mere 30%, suggesting that an umbrella might be more companion than necessity.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, expect the sun to punctuate the skyline before noon, slowly warming the city to a comfortable 60 degrees, dipping slightly in the afternoon. Pleasantness is at hand, but be mindful of the muted chill that reveals itself in the shadows, best met with a light jacket or a cozy sweater. Today holds promise\u2014ideal for a leisurely stroll through the bustling streets or a quiet moment at one of the local caf\u00e9s, where the aroma of fresh brews meets the sound of the city awakening. Perhaps venture to visit a gallery or catch a film that enriches the soul while making the most of the evolving weather. In this delicate balance of cloud and light, San Francisco breathes, inviting all to partake in its subtle dance.",
