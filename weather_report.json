With a low embracing the city around 46 degrees, a steady west-northwest wind whispers through the streets, at times animated by sudden gusts that dance up to 25 mph. This quiet night holds a promise of clarity and charm, absent of fog, with only the subtle silhouettes of the city skyline against an indigo sky.\n\nDaylight will break forth tomorrow, bringing with it a sun-drenched panorama. The expected high will hover near a cool 56 degrees\u2014 a modest warmth tempered by the wind. As the hours progress towards afternoon, temperatures will dip slightly, settling around 54. A gentle breeze will accompany the golden rays, suggesting that layers will be your best companion; a light sweater or jacket will keep you cozy as you wander through the open air. With such splendid conditions, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, savoring the ocean's breath, or a visit to one of the city's hidden cafes might invite moments of simple joy. As you revel in the day, perhaps consider finding a sunny spot to dive into a captivating book, letting time slip away under the azure expanse above.",
