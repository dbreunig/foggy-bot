The air is crisp with a low temperature skirting around 56 degrees, and the soft north wind carries the lingering scent of the bay. While the stars twinkle quietly above, a promise of sunshine edges closer with the dawn. You can almost sense that fleeting moment before the day reveals itself, filled with the potential of warmth\u2014forecasted to rise near 74 degrees tomorrow, trailing gracefully into a comfortable 70 by afternoon.\n\nAlthough remnants of fog may linger along the coastal edges, the emerging sun will likely chase away the morning\u2019s haze, paving the way for a clear and vibrant day ahead. Embrace this transition: a light jacket should suffice for the night\u2019s chill, while layers will offer adaptability for the warmth that promises to embrace the afternoon. Perhaps a serene walk along the Embarcadero is in order, or sipping coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 as the city stirs awake. The charm of the streets, the sound of laughter mingling with the aroma of fresh pastries, awaits you on this promising Sunday.",
