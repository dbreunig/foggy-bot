    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of early morning, Downtown San Francisco lies beneath a blanket of clouds that hints at the day's potential. The marine layer seems to cling closely to the city, casting a muted glow upon the streets. With temperatures resting around a mild 55 degrees, the air carries a crispness that invites a light jacket. As dawn approaches, one can expect the clouds to gradually part, revealing moments of sunlight as the city awakens. By late morning, the sun will dance shyly on the horizon, struggling to push through the lingering mist, with temperatures rising to the low sixties.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the southwest wind will taper in and out of notice, bringing with it occasional gusts that suggest a lightness in the atmosphere. While the day will not fully shake off the cool embrace of the fog, the peaks of the skyline will emerge, revealing the textured beauty of the Golden Gate and the playful character of the bay. For those looking to enjoy the day, a stroll along the waterfront or a gentle hike up to one of the hills, wrapped in a comfortable layer, could unveil the enchanting visual contrasts between the marine layer and the urban landscape. Seek out a local caf\u00e9, perhaps, curling up with a warm cup, watching the city stir from its slumber, as everything springs to life under the soft sun rays.",
