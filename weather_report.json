    "weather_report": "As the city rests in its cool embrace, a gentle wind sweeps through San Francisco's streets, whispering a reminder of the coastal charm that lingers at this hour. Under a canopy of stars, partly cloudy skies cloak the night, mingling with the brisk air that stirs the senses. Expect a lively day ahead, with the warmth of the sun beckoning around 60 degrees, a welcome contrast to the chill of the evening. The bright sun will rise, casting away shadows and infusing the day with clarity, yet it might be wise to keep an eye out for vestiges of fog that could linger along the shoreline, hinting at the marine layer's persistent kiss.\n\nFor attire, layering will be your ally; a light sweater accompanied by a windbreaker will offer comfort, embracing both the freshness of the morning and the sun's embrace later on. A stroll through the vibrant streets of Downtown, perhaps a visit to a tucked-away caf\u00e9 to savor a warm brew while taking in the distant views of the bustling pier, could lend a gentle rhythm to your day. Whether you find solace in a quiet park or indulge in a leisurely walk along the waterfront, the city's spirit awaits, inviting you to explore at a pace all your own.",
