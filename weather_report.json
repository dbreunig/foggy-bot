The sizzling straits that cradle the Golden Gate are largely concealed, softened by the frequent kiss of moisture that the fog now cautiously holds at bay. The low hum of southern winds sweeps through the streets, hinting at the dampness that will soon envelop the city\u2014whispers of impending rain echoing reminders of the chill in the morning air.\n\nAs the day unfolds, temperatures will retreat slightly from the mid-57s, greeting the afternoon with a cool embrace. It\u2019s a time to dress in layers\u2014a lightweight waterproof jacket over a cozy sweater, paired with those faithful walking shoes that are equally at home on cobblestone streets or wooden coffee shop floors. As thoughts turn to plans for the day, one might find the allure of museums hard to resist, where warmth and art conspire to chase away the gray. Or perhaps a stroll through the vibrant streets, where the fresh scent of rain mingles with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, offers a satisfying solace, even as the clouds continue their slow swirling dance overhead.",
