    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun bathes Downtown San Francisco in a gentle warmth, casting crisp shadows on the cobblestone streets. With a high near 69, the air is imbued with a lightness, though a west wind whispers through the neighborhoods, offering a refreshing counter to the sun's embrace. The sky wears a palette of soft blues and wispy clouds, pushing any remnants of fog toward the horizon and allowing for stunning views of a city that seems to glimmer in the late afternoon light. The atmosphere feels vibrant yet serene, inviting one to step outside and explore.\n\nAs night approaches, clouds will take a more prominent role in the sky, draping a soft gray blanket over the landscape, with temperatures settling around 60. A light breeze will linger, hinting at the chill that often accompanies twilight near the bay. A cardigan or light jacket would be wise as one ventures out for an evening stroll, perhaps to take in an art fair or to sip a warm drink from a nearby caf\u00e9, celebrating the day\u2019s transition with a moment of peace in a bustling environment. The evening promises comfort nestled in the fog, perfect for quiet reflections as the city begins to slow.",
