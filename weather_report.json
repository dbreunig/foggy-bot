    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day begins draped in a quilt of gray, as clouds cling to the heights and shadows stretch across the streets. The marine layer is lingering, but hints of sun push through, promising a gradual unveiling of warmth. As the clock ticked to this early hour, the air retains a coolness, reminiscent of the ocean breeze, nudged gently by winds from the west-southwest, whispering tales of a day yet to unfold. With a low hovering around 54 degrees, those venturing outside may find comfort in layering\u2014an eager sweater accompanied by a light jacket should suffice, perfect for a stroll through the historic neighborhoods or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s parks, where nature and urban life intertwine.\n\nAs afternoon approaches, forecasts suggest the clouds will part, revealing more of San Francisco's iconic skyline bathed in brighter light and achieving a high around 62 degrees. The wind may rise to jostle the leaves and ruffle light clothing, coaxing one to a casual gathering at a favorite caf\u00e9 or engaging in a leisurely walk along the waterfront, where the rhythms of the bay and the beckoning of the sun merge. Although the fog may linger in the distance, casting a soft veil over the Golden Gate, the day promises to shift towards a more enjoyable, if not entirely clear, rendezvous with the city's offerings. So, dress simply but warmly, allowing for the capricious nature of the day, and embrace the routine pleasures that accompany a San Francisco Sunday.",
