    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a mostly sunny sky, with a gentle warmth inspiring a sense of calm amidst the urban pace. The high temperature is expected to be around 65, transitioning through the day toward a cooler embrace of around 60 degrees by afternoon. The soft west-southwest breeze whispers at 3 to 7 mph, adding a delicate touch to the scene. You might catch a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge framed against the backdrop of distant hills, although the marine layer lingers at the edges of the bay, hinting at a foggy embrace waiting to roll in as the evening draws near. \n\nTonight, the evening promises to be partly cloudy with temperatures dipping to a comfortable 50 degrees. For this transitional day, lightweight layers will serve you well; a light sweater or jacket could be your companion as the sun starts its descent, and the evening beckons. Consider a leisurely walk through the vibrant streets, perhaps a pitstop at a quaint caf\u00e9, or an exploration of a local gallery, allowing the city's artistic pulse to inspire your afternoon. Such moments capture the essence of San Francisco, where every corner holds a story, and each breeze carries the salt of the sea.",
