    "weather_report": "As the sun settles, enveloped by a shroud of clouds, the evening in Downtown San Francisco reveals itself in a gentle breeze that carries the essence of the Pacific. The air is cool, cradling the city with a low hovering around 57 degrees, while gusts from the west southwest whisper promises of a night that does not betray the warmth of the day. A thin veil of marine layer lingers just offshore, hinting at the fog that often blankets this storied landscape, but tonight it remains at bay, leaving a tantalizing sense of mystery in the air.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of a mostly sunny day beckons, with highs expected to flirt near 66 degrees, gradually losing a touch of warmth as the hours unfold. Dress in layers to sidestep the erratic dance of temperatures, perhaps donning a light jacket for the morning's brisk embrace and shedding it as the sun breaks through the clouds. The lively winds, reaching up to 21 mph, may stir the leaves and rustle through casual conversations as people emerge onto the streets\u2014a perfect time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a cozy caf\u00e9 rendezvous with a good book accompanied by a steaming cup. Here, the city hums, waiting to share its allure with all who venture out, each step resonating with the rhythm of urban life beneath a shifting sky.",
