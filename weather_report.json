    "weather_report": "A gentle breeze rustles the streets of Downtown San Francisco as the afternoon sun bathes the city in a warm, inviting glow. Currently, the horizon reveals a mostly clear sky, dotted with wisps of clouds that drift lazily across the expanse. It's a comfortable day, with temperatures whispering near 65, but a subtle descent awaits as the afternoon wears on, nudging the mercury gently towards a cooler 60. Although the air is crisp, the west wind carries a soft touch, hinting at the evening's approach.\n\nTonight, as the sun dips below the iconic skyline, expect partly cloudy skies to cloak the city in a gentle embrace, settling the temperature around a mild 50 degrees. With the presence of the marine layer lingering close to the coast, the fog remains more of a distant memory for now, yet it may return later, casting its ethereal veil over the bay. For those wandering the streets today, light layers are advisable: perhaps a light sweater or jacket to fend off the evening chill. Consider savoring a leisurely stroll through the vibrant neighborhoods, where caf\u00e9s beckon with the aroma of fresh brews, or perhaps find a quiet bench in one of the nearby parks to watch the sunset paint the sky in muted oranges and purples. It\u2019s a day to relish the simple joys that the city has to offer.",
