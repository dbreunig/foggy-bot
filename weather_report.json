    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a sunny embrace, with the gentle caress of a west-southwest wind steering a subtle freshness through the air. As the day hunches toward its golden hour, the temperature cools slightly, inviting a sense of comfort that beckons one to engage in simple pleasures. The horizon, kissed by soft sunshine, reveals a skyline mostly unencumbered by fog. However, the familiar marine layer, characteristic of this coastal haven, lingers perilously close, hugging the edges of the city and teasing those familiar with its mercurial temperament.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the skies will yield to a partly cloudy canvas, creating a tranquil setting for an evening stroll or a quiet seat on a terrace, perhaps accompanied by a warm drink to stave off the evening chill. With temperatures expected to descend to a cozy low, dressing in layers will ensure comfort, blending casual elegance with practicality. It\u2019s an ideal time to wander through the charming neighborhoods or find a hidden caf\u00e9, savoring the day's lingering warmth before surrendering to the cooler embrace of the night. Embrace the moments, for this day unfolds with a restrained charm.",
