    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the skies remain largely overcast, hinting at a night filled with the gentle patter of rain expected before dawn. The cool air, kissing at around fifty-two degrees, carries whispers of moisture, suggesting a soft blanket of mist may soon descend, wrapping the city in its cool embrace. The southwest winds, meandering through the streets at a modest pace, offer a delicate rustle to the evening, yet the remnants of a day that promised some brightness are fading into obscurity.\n\nThe promise of Friday, however, brings a welcome shift. A glimmer of sunlight seeks to break through the clouds with a high hovering around fifty-nine, slowly transitioning to cooler air by afternoon\u2019s approach. It may not be the sunniest of days, but the winds will be soft and steady, inviting those willing to don a light jacket to step outside. As the city beckons, consider a stroll through hidden corners, a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9, or simply enjoying the vibrant energy of San Francisco's evening rhythm. Whether it\u2019s warm tea with a view or a leisurely walk down the bustling streets, the night holds a quiet charm amidst the chill.",
