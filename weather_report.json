    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun is making a spirited appearance, casting a golden hue over the cityscape as it begins its journey across the sky. A gentle westward breeze whispers through the air, offering a refreshing contrast to the day's warmth. The temperature is expected to hover around a pleasant 67 degrees before gracefully settling into the comfortable embrace of the mid-60s by afternoon. \n\nYet, whispers of fog still linger at the city\u2019s edges, a soft marine layer offering hints of a misty backdrop to the iconic sights of the Golden Gate and the elegant skyline. Tonight, the clouds will deepen, wrapping the city in a cozy blanket as temperatures slip into the soothing mid-50s. Dress in layers to fully enjoy the day\u2019s sunny charm and prepare for the evening\u2019s chill; a light jacket over a breezy shirt will suffice. This lovely climate invites a stroll through Golden Gate Park, perhaps a quiet moment with a book in one of its many serene corners, or a leisurely exploration of the quaint cafes that dot the streets. Embrace the day and all its potential for simple pleasures.",
