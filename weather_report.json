    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a serene clarity, allowing the urban landscape to bask in gentle sunlight. With a high temperature settling around a comfortable sixty-six degrees, the cool west-southwest winds carry hints of salt and sea, a reminder of the city's close connection to the bay. This morning\u2019s weather invites light layers; a crisp jacket or a snug sweater might be wise as the breeze dances playfully through the streets. \n\nAs the sun arcs across the sky, the tranquility will give way to a slightly cooler afternoon, a whisper from the bay reminding us we are indeed in this coastal haven. Fog may flirt with the horizon, especially near the Golden Gate, but for now, it seems to hold its distance, promising clear vistas toward the north. As the day progresses, one might find solace strolling along the Embarcadero or enjoying a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, embracing the elegance of an early spring day that feels as fresh and lively as new ink on paper.",
