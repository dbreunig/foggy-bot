Morning temperatures hover comfortably in the low fifties, an invitation for layers\u2014a light sweater over a t-shirt should suffice for those venturing out at this tranquil hour. \n\nBy midday, the sun will reign with a high near 64, casting a warm glow on the vibrant cityscape while a refreshing breeze picks up, drawing dramatic movement in the trees and sending the occasional burst of laughter from passersby. The fog, ever the elusive character of this city, remains at bay today, hinting only at its presence along the distant hills. As the afternoon approaches, the temperatures will cool slightly, nudging toward 62 as the breeze strengthens, making a stroll through parks or a visit to a caf\u00e9 for a hot beverage a delightful way to enjoy the day. Those craving a taste of the bay area\u2019s charm will find joy in simply meandering through bustling streets, perhaps indulging in an impromptu moment of people-watching or basking in the artful scene of the waterfront.",
