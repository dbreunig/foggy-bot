    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle sunlight bathing the city in warmth, casting the vibrant outlines of familiar landmarks against the clear backdrop of a blue sky. As the temperatures hover near the low sixties, a whisper of a breeze from the northwest adds a refreshing touch, making it a day that invites you to step outside, leaving the confines of indoor spaces. The clarity here paints a scene unmarred by fog, allowing views to stretch across the bay towards the Golden Gate Bridge, with not a trace of the marine layer that sometimes characterizes this coastal city.\n\nAs night approaches, the promise of a calm evening lingers, with temperatures dipping to a crisp 48 degrees. Dressing in layers would be wise; a light jacket will suffice against the coolness that arrives once the sun begins to set. It\u2019s a perfect opportunity to enjoy a stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps pausing to sip a warm beverage at a nearby caf\u00e9, or to find a cozy spot in a local park, relishing the serenity as the sky transitions to deeper hues of twilight. There\u2019s beauty in the simplicity of this day, beckoning you to savor moments that are comfortably ordinary yet deeply enriching.",
