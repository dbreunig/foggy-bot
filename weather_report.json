    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, revealing a scene where sunlit clarity meets the gentle embrace of a westward breeze. As temperatures hover near 61 degrees, with a soft decline expected, the air feels crisp yet inviting. The wind, whispering through the city streets, carries with it the promise of a pleasant day, despite the typical marine layer that may soon settle in like a shroud over the Golden Gate. \n\nTonight, a patchwork of partly cloudy skies will blanket the city, descending toward a comfortable low of around 50 degrees. The winds will linger lightly, coaxing residents to don layers, perhaps a light sweater or a tailored jacket, as they explore the evening. With such a tranquil atmosphere, one might find delight in a leisurely stroll through the gardens at Golden Gate Park, or perhaps mulling over a warm cup of coffee at a cozy corner caf\u00e9, as the city begins to wind down. Enjoying the soft glow of streetlights against the twilight, one is reminded of the understated charm that San Francisco offers, even as the fog, ever familiar, prepares to weave itself through the landscape.",
