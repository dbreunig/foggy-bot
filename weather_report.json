    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the early morning whispers of patchy drizzle linger, cloaked in a gentle veil of clouds that keeps the city slightly shrouded. The temperature sits comfortably at the threshold of 59, with a light west wind drifting through at about 8 mph. This morning's humidity will soon give way as the drizzle fades before 11 AM, making room for glimpses of sunshine. The day promises a high of around 67, lazily retreating to 65 in the afternoon, as coastal winds shift to subtly gustier notes.\n\nThe air carries an invigorating chill, marking the transition from night to day, and it feels like one might wear a lightweight jacket or wrap, layered over a simple tee. A stroll through the Mission District, where the sun begins to dance on vibrant murals, or perhaps a leisurely sit at a caf\u00e9, sipping on a warm drink while watching the soft awakening of city life, would suit this serene morning well. As the fog intertwines with the gentle urban rhythm, the city reveals its character anew, inviting exploration under the embrace of its iconic skyline.",
