Tonight, the air carries a crispness, a low of around 49, with hints of moisture lingering just out of sight, teasing those awake with the possibility of imminent showers after dawn. The wind stirs softly from the south, a gentle reminder of nature's presence amidst the urban sprawl, ready to whip into occasional gusts that might catch the unwary by surprise.\n\nTomorrow unfurls with the promise of rain, draping the city in a moody palette of gray. Highs will struggle to reach the lower sixties, hinting at a chill that may linger into the afternoon. Dress warmly, perhaps in layers that can adapt to the cool breeze and the fresh wetness that is certain to come. For the pragmatic wanderer, it's a day to find solace indoors\u2014perhaps a quiet caf\u00e9 where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee warms the spirit, or a bookstore that invites hours of escape into the written word. The city may be enveloped in a soft fog, with the marine layer wrapping around the familiar skyline, transforming every view into a captivating monochrome. It\u2019s a reminder that nature often weaves a whimsical tapestry even among the concrete and steel.",
