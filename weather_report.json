    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the city bathes in a mostly sunny ambiance, delicate breezes whispering through the streets. The temperature hovers near a refreshing 65 degrees, subtly yielding to a more temperate 63 as the day unfolds. A persistent west-southwest wind, dancing at 23 mph and occasionally gusting to 29 mph, adds an invigorating edge to your stroll. Yet, beneath the vibrant sky lies a hint of uncertainty; the marine layer sleeps not far off, teasing the bay with whispers of fog, ready to drape itself over the Golden Gate in twilight's embrace.\n\nAs evening approaches, the horizon will shift to a more muted palette. The clouds will gather, transforming the sky into a soft canvas, and the temperature will settle down to around 57 degrees. The same stirring winds will continue their playful ballet, rendering a light jacket a wise companion for your evening ventures. With these conditions, consider embarking on a leisurely walk through the neighborhood, perhaps stopping by a quaint caf\u00e9 or enjoying a book in one of the local parks. As the day transitions to night, the gentle caress of the breeze invites you to savor quiet moments, whether it be with a warm drink or with friends under the striking San Francisco skyline.",
