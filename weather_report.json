    "weather_report": "As afternoon drapes itself gently over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of dense clouds casts a subdued light upon the city. Though the temperature hovers in the cool embrace of the mid-fifties, the ambience is shaped by the promise of rain impending after five o'clock, whispering through the air with a fifty percent chance of precipitation. Clarity is somewhat muted, and the horizon bears traces of fog, lingering near the Golden Gate, hinting at its familiar, elusive embrace. This typically beautiful vista has taken on a quieter profile, stripped of the piercing sunlight, giving way to an atmosphere that feels particularly introspective.\n\nAs evening approaches, the chance of rain lingers like a distant memory, ready to awaken when the clock strikes eleven. The wind nudges gently at your back, a caress from the west, hinting at layers of warmth just beneath the surface chill. For those venturing out, a light jacket or a cozy sweater would provide solace against the creeping cold. An ideal evening could unfold in the charms of a warm caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with conversations and laughter, or perhaps a leisurely stroll through the city, allowing the mist to infuse the air with a sense of adventure. Today, the city invites you to pause, to savor the subtlety of its beauty enveloped in clouds and the promise of rain.",
