    "weather_report": "As the clock gently tolls past midnight, Downtown San Francisco stirs beneath a quilt of clouds, hinting at rain. The air carries a slightly chilled whisper, with temperatures beginning their ascent towards a cooler dawn. Fog, though not overwhelming, lingers near the edges of the city, veiling the Golden Gate Bridge and softening the once-pristine lines of skyline. The streets, glimmering with remnants of the evening, are alive yet quiet, suggesting that a light mist may dance through the early hours, leaving a subtle sheen on pavement as it prepares for daybreak.\n\nAs Wednesday unfolds, the clouds will partially part, unveiling a mix of sun and lingering overcast. The morning may carry a few drops from the twilight\u2019s shower, yet hints of blue sky promise to emerge as the day progresses. Dress with layers in mind; a light jacket will be your ally against the briskness lingering from the night\u2019s chill, while a slight bend in the afternoon temperature may coax you to embrace comfort in a sweater. Consider strolling through the quiet streets, visiting a nearby caf\u00e9 to savor a hot brew, or perhaps perusing an independent bookstore, taking solace in the stories that leap from pages as the city shakes off its overnight slumber. The day extends a promise of subtle adventure\u2014a perfect canvas to greet the unexpected, if only to pause and soak in the city\u2019s unique charm amid the gentle ebb of the tide.",
