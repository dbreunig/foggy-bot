    "weather_report": "This evening in Downtown San Francisco, the air is kissed by a gentle chill, settling in around 47 degrees as the twilight deepens. A cloud-studded sky lingers, maybe conceding to hints of clear visibility toward the horizon, softened by shifting winds from the west northwest. Stray gusts twirl upwards of 24 mph, mingling with the scent of the ocean and woody undercurrents, whether curling around the Golden Gate or lapping against the shoreline. \n\nAs the night gives way to Monday, expect a clearer disposition to the skies, the sun to peep confidently above and shine against the city\u2019s iconic silhouette. Temperatures will nudge close to a moderate 57 degrees before gently drifting down as afternoon approaches. For those venturing out, a layered approach is wise; a light sweater or jacket will ward off the lingering coolness, leaving you comfortable yet agile in the crisp air. Perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, with a warm cup of coffee to embrace the day or a gentle bike ride to feel the exhilarating embrace of the winds, would best suit the unfolding pleasure of a San Francisco Monday.",
