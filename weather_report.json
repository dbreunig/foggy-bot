    "weather_report": "In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Downtown San Francisco wakes to the promise of a clear day ahead. The sky, brushed with faint hues of dawn, is largely devoid of the familiar fog that often cloaks the city in a veil of mystery. With temperatures currently hovering around a crisp 51 degrees, the air carries a gentle west-southwest breeze, stirring life into the quiet streets. As the sun rises, it will gracing the skyline with warmth, inviting a high that will reach towards 66 degrees, though a slight cooling will tease the afternoon at about 64.\n\nThe city stands poised to offer a splendid day, unmarred by the usual blanket of marine layer that shrouds the bay. One might slip into a light jacket, perhaps a stylish cardigan, as a nod to the early chill, but as midday approaches, lighter layers will do just fine against the soft warmth of the sun. This is a day crafted for simple pleasures; perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering Bay provides a tranquil backdrop for reflection. Alternatively, wandering through the vibrant streets of the Mission might inspire a delightful discovery, as local shops and caf\u00e9s hum with the vibrancy of life. Enjoy the clarity and the slight bite in the air; there is something invigorating about a sunny day in this storied city.",
