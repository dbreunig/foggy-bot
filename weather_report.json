    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle blanket of clouds enfolds the city, with temperatures settling around a comfortable 54 degrees. The air carries a brisk west-southwest wind, lightly stirring the atmosphere at speeds up to 21 mph. There's an invigorating freshness about the evening, albeit tinged with the faint whispers of marine fog, likely clinging close to the edges where the land meets the bay.\n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, the city will awaken to a predominantly sunny day, giving way to a high of 63 degrees. This warmth, curiously, will ebb slightly as the afternoon progresses, a playful nod from the coastal winds. With gusts reaching up to 26 mph, one can expect a lively breeze that will add a touch of excitement to the day. The forecasted sunny disposition invites one to step outside, perhaps for a stroll along the Embarcadero or a relaxed coffee at a corner caf\u00e9, where one can savor the vibrant energy of the city unfurling before you. A light jacket might offer a layer of comfort, perfect for enjoying an afternoon outdoors as the sun dances lightly in the cooler breezes.",
