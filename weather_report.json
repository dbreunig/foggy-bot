The forecast hints at a high near 66, a temperature that gracefully dips towards 64 as the day progresses, ushered along by a steady west wind. While the sky holds onto its mostly sunny disposition, there's an edge to the atmosphere, suggesting both clarity and a shrouded mystique, typical of a city known for its unpredictable embrace of coastal fog. \n\nTonight brings the promise of a slight chance of drizzle as the clouds settle in, accompanied by mild breezes. With a cool low around 59, the air beckons for cozy layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a denim jacket to ward off the evening chill. As the sun sinks, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the reflective waters play host to shifting patterns of light, or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many inviting coffee shops, where the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee complements the gathering clouds. This evening appears to whisper of tranquil moments and gentle goodbyes to the day\u2014a perfect time to indulge in the simple, lingering joys of urban life.",
