    "weather_report": "Tonight, the sky over Downtown San Francisco offers a serene calmness, with a gentle breeze whispering through the streets at around six miles per hour. The air, hovering around a cool fifty degrees, is bracing yet inviting, perfect for a peaceful evening stroll along the Embarcadero, where you might catch the glimmer of the Bay reflecting muted city lights. With no fog to obscure the view, the cityscape stands prominently beneath the moonlight, a tranquil scene amidst the high-rises.\n\nAs we step into Thursday, a promise of sunshine brightens our expectations. The day will unfurl with warmth, climbing to near seventy in the early hours, only to settle around sixty-four by afternoon. The north-northeast winds will continue to bring in a pleasant touch. It would be wise to wear layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater over your shirt to embrace the shifting temperatures\u2014ideal for a leisurely afternoon at one of the many parks or a casual caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating, where you may sip a coffee while the world goes by, enveloped in the vibrant charm of San Francisco. Dress lightly but keep that cardigan handy; the day promises clarity, unmarred by fog, making it a splendid setting for both relaxation and gentle exploration.",
