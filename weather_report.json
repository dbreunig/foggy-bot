    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the early morning, a serene calm blankets Downtown San Francisco under a canopy of stars. The air is crisp, hinting at the chill that accompanies the approaching dawn, with temperatures resting at a refreshing low of 49 degrees. With a gentle north-northeast breeze whispering through the streets, the city welcomes the day without the usual fog that often hugs the Golden Gate, allowing for a clear view of landmarks with crisp precision.\n\nAs the morning unfolds into a promising Friday, the sun will gradually sweep across the sky, offering a warm embrace with a peak temperature nearing 63 degrees by midday. The familiar heartbeat of the city will quicken as the sunlight pours onto well-trodden sidewalks and street corners. The winds, slightly more robust, will carry a playful chill, reminding one to reach for a light jacket before stepping out. It\u2019s one of those days that invites a simple yet fulfilling agenda; perhaps a leisurely stroll down to the Ferry Building, where the scent of fresh pastries mingles with the invigorating sea breeze, or enjoying a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9 while the warmth of the sun begins to rise. The clarity of the day suggests the harbor might call to those seeking a brief escape on the water, or simply lingering in a park, watching life flow by, all under a vast, open sky.",
