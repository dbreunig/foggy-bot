The sky plays coy, sulking under a cover of clouds that hint at clarity yet to come. With a chill in the atmosphere, the temperature edges around fifty, suggesting that a light layer is in order for those venturing out before sunlight breaks the horizon. The gentle west wind carries the promise of a new day, ushering forth the prospect of a partly sunny Sunday\u2014a welcome reprieve from the gray.\n\nBy midday, the clouds will gradually part to reveal a soft blue backdrop, inviting urban explorers to the enticing charm of the city. Dress comfortably with layers; a light sweater paired with a windbreaker will keep you snug as you stroll through the bustling streets or sit in a park to savor a cup of steaming coffee. It\u2019s a day that beckons leisurely strolls across the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet afternoon spent perusing the aisles of a beloved bookstore. As the sun rises higher, expect the temperature to settle pleasantly around sixty, an ideal canvas for savoring the beauty of a quintessential San Francisco Sunday, all while keeping an eye out for the gentle fog that may sweep in along the coastline, just to remind you of this city's ever-changing embrace.",
