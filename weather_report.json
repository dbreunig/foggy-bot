    "weather_report": "As the city awakens under a canopy of stars, Downtown San Francisco breathes in the cool night air, resting in relative quiet. Tonight, the sky is mostly clear, a gentle respite that hints at the warmth to come. The low around 58 invites a light jacket or a cozy sweater for fond memories of the evening breeze. The subtle west-southwest wind, brushing through at about 12 mph, carries whispers of what lies ahead.\n\nTomorrow promises sun-soaked joy, as the day unfolds toward a high near 69. As the city stirs to life, the warmth will soften the lingering chill of early morning, ushering temperatures down to a comfortable, late-afternoon embrace of around 66. The west-southwest wind will dance more fervently, gusting up to 20 mph, infusing vitality into the environment. It's a day that beckons for leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero, perhaps a visit to the farmer's market with its vibrant produce, or a quiet moment lost in one of the city\u2019s sun-dappled parks. Appropriate attire would feature layers, allowing for seamless navigation of the day's metamorphosis from cool to comfortably warm, perfectly enabling San Franciscans to savor the delight of a clear, invigorating day.",
