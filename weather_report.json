The temperature hovers around a mild 54 degrees, accompanied by a soft breeze whispering in from the west. The atmosphere feels serene, hinting at the typical coolness that drapes the city at night. In the morning light, however, a promise of sunshine emerges, clearing the way for a day bathed in warmth\u2014a high gently reaching into the 64-degree range before gracefully easing into the afternoon chill.\n\nAs the new day unfolds, anticipate a landscape where the sun plays peekaboo with the remaining cloud cover, a brief gift of clarity amidst the evolving skies. While pockets of fog may linger along the edges of the bay, the core of the city remains bright, ideal for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or an exploration of the vibrant local caf\u00e9s. Dressing in layers will be key; a light jacket will provide comfort against the briskness of the wind while still allowing room to breathe amid the rising warmth of midday. And as you sip your morning coffee or take a gentle walk, allow the moment to relax your spirit, embracing the city's unique blend of urban charm and natural beauty.",
