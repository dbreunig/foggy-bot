    "weather_report": "An embrace of golden sunlight unfolds over Downtown San Francisco this morning, the horizon blushing with warm hues as the sun rises. The city basks in clear visibility\u2014a delightful contrast to the misty mornings often found in these parts. With the forecast promising a sunny day nearing 65 degrees, the weather invites the city to come alive, aided by a brisk westerly breeze that dances through the streets at 8 to 21 mph. Expect gusts that whisper urgency, pushing you to relish the lilt of the day.\n\nAs the sun climbs higher, it beckons one toward the bustling local caf\u00e9s for a warm brew or perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. Dressed in light layers, ideal for a day that begins cool and gradually warms, a light sweater or jacket will suffice as you navigate your morning adventures. The absence of fog over iconic landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge allows for views that feel almost cinematic, while the clear air enhances the vibrancy of the day. As evening approaches, expect a gentle coolness settling in with the falling sun, making it perfect for wrapping yourself in a comfortable layer for a night spent beneath the stars.",
