    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a serene canopy of partially cloudy skies, with the city embracing a mild low around 50 degrees. A gentle west-southwest breeze stirs, whispering soothingly through the urban landscape. The hints of a marine layer linger off the coast, softly veiling the majestic Golden Gate, but it does little to dim the city\u2019s undeniable charm as the evening settles in.\n\nAs Saturday dawns, expect a gracious gift of mostly sunny skies, inviting the warmth of the sun to rise to a pleasant high near 66. While the early morning may be kissed by remnants of the marine layer, by afternoon it will gracefully recede, allowing the city to bask in clarity. The light winds will continue to accompany you, a reminder of the coastal magic that characterizes this place. In this inviting climate, a light jacket or a cozy layer invites comfort as you embark on nonchalant weekend explorations\u2014perhaps a spontaneous visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 or a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where you can sip a warm beverage while soaking in the tranquil views of the bay. Tonight hints at a cozy retreat, with tomorrow beckoning new adventures under sunlit skies.",
