    "weather_report": "As the golden hour casts a soft light across Downtown San Francisco, the city basks in a splendid, sunny afternoon. The temperature, a leisurely 64 degrees, encourages strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a gathering in the park. Pleasant west winds whisper through the streets, offering just the right touch of refreshing air as the day dips toward its evening phase. However, the horizon hints at a shift; clouds gather with the mere promise of rain, casting an inviting mystery over the twilight sky.\n\nAs the day softens, a slight chill will emerge, ushering in cool breezes by nightfall. Residents and visitors alike might consider layering up, a light jacket or sweater perfect for the evening chill, especially as the mercury dips to a comfortable 53 degrees. The forecast nudges towards a muted night, with a gentle possibility of rain beginning after 11 PM, but nothing that should deter an evening outdoors if one so chooses. Whether one finds solace in a quiet caf\u00e9 or meanders through the lively streets, tonight offers a delightful respite from the bustle of the day\u2019s sunlit embrace.",
