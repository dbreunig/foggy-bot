    "weather_report": "As dawn quietly unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a cool embrace, whispering hints of a marine layer lingering just beyond the hills. The city, adorned in shades of gray and blue, offers a characteristically moody, yet beautiful palette, bathed under a veil of mostly clouded skies. The low of 56 degrees feels refreshing against the skin, complemented by a gentle breeze from the west, weaving through the streets like a playful spirit, occasionally escalating into soft gusts that dance through the trees at 18 mph.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the forecast hints at a slight chance of drizzle after 5 PM, suggesting that while the sun may attempt to break through the clouds, a subtle dampness might persist. Anticipate a high of 63, where layers of light clothing become a wise choice, allowing one to relish the temperate weather while remaining prepared for the light coolness that drapes the city in the evening. This is a day perfectly suited for wandering through local boutiques or sipping a warm drink in one of the many cozy cafes that dot the landscape, allowing one to soak in the city's charm while gently accompanying the weather's embrace.",
