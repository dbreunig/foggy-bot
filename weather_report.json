    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco carries an air of subdued charm, as a delicate patina of drizzle mingles with the pervasive fog, lending the skyline a dreamlike quality. Visibility may be limited, particularly as your gaze drifts toward the horizon where the Golden Gate Bridge quietly emerges and vanishes within the swirling mist. The day will evolve gradually; expect the sun, retreating and peeking out from behind the shifting clouds, to offer only brief interludes of warmth as temperatures hover just above the brisk edge of coolness.\n\nAs you prepare to venture into the day, consider layering your attire thoughtfully, opting for a light jacket or cardigan that can be easily shed as you navigate between the sunlit pockets and the cooler shadows cast by the city's iconic Victorian structures. Footwear that can handle a bit of moisture might serve you well, giving you the freedom to explore leisurely strolls through Union Square or the waterfront, inviting simple pleasures such as indulging in a warm beverage at a local caf\u00e9 or catching the rhythm of the city as it gently awakens. Enjoy the quiet beauty that defines a fog-kissed San Francisco morning; the day may promise an adventure less shared but deeply felt.",
