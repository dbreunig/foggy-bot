    "weather_report": "As the sun descends into the horizon, San Francisco finds itself shrouded in a mild embrace of cloud cover, leaving behind the brassy warmth of the day. There\u2019s a whisper of drizzle expected to kiss the city come early morning, though tonight remains in a gentle stillness, underlined with soft winds from the west, creating a serene ambience. The air is cool, about 57 degrees, inviting a layer for warmth yet still pleasant enough for those who yearn for the late-night stroll.\n\nTomorrow promises a delicate opening, as the dawn brings with it a hint of sunshine, teasing through the clouds and warming the city to a comfortable 65 degrees. As the afternoon rolls around, temperatures will ease back to 63, a reminder of the ever-changing moods of this coastal beauty. Winds may invigorate the atmosphere with their playful gusts, but a slight chance of drizzle lingers, awaiting another moment of intimacy with the ground.\n\nThe city breathes a quiet charm; ideal for a wander amidst its iconic streets, perhaps embracing the fading light with a walk along the waterfront, or indulging in a cozy caf\u00e9 nestled in the heart of downtown. Layers will serve as both comfort and practicality, shielding against the cool air while allowing you to relish in the aromas and sights of the evening. Whether one pursues solitude in the company of a good book or gathers in the subtle buzz of conversation with friends, tonight offers a canvas painted in muted tones, inviting moments of reflection and connection.",
