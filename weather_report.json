    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, shadows stretch like ghosts through the stillness, cradled by a layer of cloud that shrouds the city in a soft, muted embrace. The temperature lingers around a mild 56 degrees, inviting a gentle awakening. The sky, draped in a veil of gray, hints at the possibility of a sun-soaked day ahead, though for now, the west-southwest wind whispers promises of a change. \n\nBy mid-morning, the clouds will give way to the sun, revealing a landscape splashed with gold. The high will hover around 67, tapering to a comfortable 65 as the afternoon wanes. While the breeze picks up, challenging your light outerwear with playful gusts, it\u2019s best to layer up; a light sweater or jacket will shield you against the cool air that can emerge at any moment. The fog that often lingers along the coast may still be hanging low over the Golden Gate, a reminder of summer's embrace but will retreat in the face of the sun's determination. For those seeking moments of leisure, a stroll through the local parks\u2014filled with the gentle rustle of leaves and distant laughter\u2014invites you to soak in the calm before the rush of day takes hold. Whether it\u2019s a leisurely coffee on a sun-drenched terrace or a quiet moment of reflection by the bay, today holds the promise of simple joys amid the vibrant pulse of this beautiful city.",
