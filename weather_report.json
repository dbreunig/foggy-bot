The temperature tips gently towards 57, creating a cool yet soothing atmosphere, kissed by a westerly breeze that whispers through the streets at 14 to 17 mph. Gusts flirt with the treetops at 21 mph, adding a playful touch to the night air. The iconic Golden Gate Bridge stands partially obscured but resilient, a reminder of the city's character that charms locals and visitors alike.\n\nLooking ahead, tomorrow promises a dance with the sun, as it peeks through the scattered clouds to reach a high of 65. As the day unfurls, temperatures will subtly drop to about 63 in the afternoon. While the winds may whip a little stronger\u2014up to 23 mph and gusting as high as 29\u2014this is San Francisco\u2019s embrace of summer, a breeze that invites exploration. With the mild weather, a light jacket may suffice, particularly for the evening strolls along the Embarcadero, where the air tastes sweet with hints of salt. As the sun emerges, consider a visit to one of the local cafes, tucked away in the Mission or around Union Square, perhaps paired with a leisurely walk to savor the changing light and the soft buzzing energy of the day ahead, letting the ordinary weave into the extraordinary as you meander through the city.",
