    "weather_report": "As morning unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth begins to replace the cool embrace of night. The horizon glimmers with the promise of sunshine, cloaked only sporadically by wisps of lingering fog that cling to the Bay, softening the outlines of distant hills and the stately Golden Gate Bridge. The air, crisp yet inviting, carries the faint scent of the sea, hinting at the eclectic life that thrives just beyond the trembling shore. With a low around 54 degrees, a light jacket may still be appropriate, but as the day progresses, the sunshine will cascade in, lifting temperatures to a pleasant peak of nearly 70 degrees by afternoon.\n\nAs this sunny day unfolds, the brisk yet mild south-southwest winds will dance through the streets, bringing a refreshing chill that lends itself beautifully to an afternoon stroll. Perhaps a visit to a charming caf\u00e9 for a warm brew or a leisurely walk by the waterfront will suit the mood, as the city reveals itself, vibrant and alive. Today allows for the ordinary to shine in its extraordinary beauty\u2014a simple moment spent observing the tide or a quiet lunch at a park bench will provide a perfect balance against the backdrop of an ever-changing landscape of sea and sky.",
