    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle chill begins to embrace the city, with temperatures dropping to a refreshing low. Tonight whispers of rain are possible, with the skies mostly cloaked in soft clouds, presenting a moody yet captivating scene. A warm wind carries the salty breath of the ocean, creating a palpable connection to the bay, while the chance of precipitation lingers like an artist's brush waiting to strike the canvas with delicate strokes of water. The marine layer threatens to snuggle in, but for now, it dances at the edges, softening the cityscape without completely obscuring the view.\n\nAs we look toward tomorrow, the promise of sunshine emerges, breaking through the clouds with a gentle insistence. The day will present a tranquil, mostly sunny atmosphere, ideal for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 where you can watch the world flow by. A light jacket will suffice, perfect for layering against the lingering coolness of the late afternoon. Perhaps an opportunity awaits to dive into the whimsical shops of the Mission or savor an artisanal pastry while enjoying the transforming panorama that unfolds as the fog begins to retreat. Embrace the day with open arms and wear the weather like a soft embrace rather than a heavy coat; it invites exploration rather than retreat.",
