    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco greets the day with a soft warmth wrapping around buildings as the afternoon sun filters through a mostly sunny sky. Fleeting clouds dance in a gentle wind, providing a serene backdrop for those traversing the streets below. While temperatures rise to a comfortable 60 degrees, there\u2019s a subtle hint of a chill, the kind that nudges you to grab a light jacket as the breeze whispers through the avenues. \n\nAs the afternoon gives way to evening, expect the warmth to retreat gently, settling around 50 degrees. The westward wind continues, though it moderates into a mild caress, perfect for lingering conversations over half-empty coffee cups or joyful strolls along the waterfront. Visibility is clear, with any hint of fog kept at bay, leaving just a touch of the iconic marine layer that often drapes the city in mystery. Dress in layers to embrace the fluctuating temperatures, perhaps a cozy sweater paired with a light scarf. After work hours, the atmosphere beckons one to wander into the heart of the Mission for artisanal bites, or perhaps to explore the vibrant murals under the fading sunset, where the city feels alive with stories waiting to unfold.",
