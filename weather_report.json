    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a gentle shroud of clouds blankets the skyline, offering a muted yet tranquil ambiance reminiscent of a painting softly brushed in grays and blues. The air is cool, hovering around a refreshing 54 degrees, with a steady wind whispering from the west-southwest, brushing lightly against the skin. It evokes a sense of comfort, inviting one to nestle into a soft sweater or a light jacket, suggestions of warmth without being overwhelming.\n\nTomorrow promises a shift, a mostly sunny canvas painting a portrait of the day ahead\u2014highs reaching near 63 degrees, tapering to a cozy 61 in the afternoon. The morning may still hold traces of fog clinging stubbornly to the shore, retreating with the sun as it climbs higher, revealing the iconic landmarks bathed in crisp clarity. As the gentle breeze dances through the streets, it beckons you to stroll the waterfront or perhaps dive into a local caf\u00e9 for warmth and company. There lies charm in this moment, where the city pauses, caught in a fleeting embrace of coolness and the promise of a brighter, clearer day just over the horizon.",
