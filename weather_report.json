    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, this afternoon unfolds with a lovely clarity that accentuates the city's vibrant landscape. The sun casts its warm touch over the streets, reaching a pleasant high, while the gentle west winds add a refreshing touch to the air. As the day drapes into evening, a serene calmness will envelop the skyline, giving way to a clear night where the temperature comfortably dips, creating an inviting atmosphere perfectly suited for a leisurely stroll or gathering with friends outdoors. \n\nCurrently, the absence of fog is a notable feature, allowing for unhindered views across the bay and beyond. With a mild temperature, light layers would best serve for the transition from the warmth of the day to the cooler night. As twilight approaches, one might consider sipping a warm beverage at an outdoor caf\u00e9, enjoying the lively ambiance that fills the air, or perhaps taking a moment to appreciate the city\u2019s lights as they begin to twinkle like stars upon the horizon.",
