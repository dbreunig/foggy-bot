The day, primarily sunlit and warmish, now gives way to the cool embrace of twilight, air infused with the gentle whisper of west winds. The remnants of the day\u2019s warmth hover around 56 degrees, subtly inviting you to shed layers or keep cozy; a light jacket or a soft sweater should serve well in this mild, sometimes breezy atmosphere.\n\nThe clouds gather softly, weaving through the sky like delicate thoughts. Though the fog has yet to fully reclaim its domain, vestiges linger, hinting at a marine layer that may soon roll in. The clarity of distant vistas speaks of a moment still kissed by sunlight, yet a sense of anticipation hangs in the air, setting the stage for the evening\u2019s cooler remembrances. Activity beckons\u2014consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or an impromptu caf\u00e9 visit to sip warm beverages while watching the evening crowd. In this gentle twilight, there\u2019s a unique kind of peace, perfect for reflection or quiet conversation, making tonight one worth savoring.",
