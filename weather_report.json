    "weather_report": "As the sun begins its ascent over Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a graceful promise of mostly sunny skies. A slight breeze from the west southwest stirs the air, adding a gentle vibrancy to the atmosphere. Temperatures hover pleasantly around 65 degrees, inviting one to step outside and embrace the day. However, the tranquility of the morning is tempered by a subtle shift in the afternoon\u2014a soft descent to around 62 degrees as clouds begin to weave their way into the blue expanse. \n\nTonight, as the daylight wanes, a blanket of clouds will wrap around the city, settling into a comfortable low of 55 degrees. The west southwest wind may linger, whispering through the streets, creating a perfect backdrop for an evening stroll or a cozy gathering with friends. With the marine layer likely lurking in the distance, a light jacket would serve well against the chill, mingling with the lingering warmth of the day. Today presents not just a chance for outdoor exploration\u2014perhaps a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment in a local caf\u00e9\u2014but also an invitation for quiet reflection as the city welcomes the twilight.",
