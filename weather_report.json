    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the night, Downtown San Francisco finds itself under a mostly clear sky, with a gentle warmth settling in as the low temperature hovers around 59 degrees. The serene ambiance is softly stirred by a light west-southwest wind, whispering through the streets at roughly 10 mph, offering a subtle reminder of the shifting coastal clime. As dawn approaches, the city's character begins to reveal itself; anticipation hangs in the air.\n\nAs morning unfurls, expect a delightful Friday, where the sun takes charge, illuminating the vibrant streets and casting an inviting glow over the iconic skyline. With a high nearing 68 degrees, the day promises a perfect blend of warmth and a refreshing breeze, gusting up to 25 mph at times, encouraging one to venture outdoors. The limited fog lingers in the distance, allowing glimpses of the Golden Gate Bridge, while the marine layer retreats with the rising sun. This golden opportunity invites casual strolls through bustling neighborhoods, a leisurely brunch at a hidden caf\u00e9, or perhaps an exploration of the vibrant murals sprinkled throughout the Mission District. Layer comfortably; a light jacket will serve well against the breeze, allowing for an ease of movement through the city's mosaic of experiences.",
