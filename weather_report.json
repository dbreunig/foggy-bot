With temperatures hovering around a pleasant 66 degrees, the breeze carries whispers of coastal joy, a westward wind rustling through the streets at 16 miles per hour. You may find, however, that as the day wanes, those mild numbers inch downward toward a cozy 63, wrapping you in the gentle embrace of the Pacific's influence.\n\nTonight beckons with a partly cloudy canopy, where stars might flicker through the clouds but the warmth remains, dipping to a comfortable 52 degrees. The subtle interplay of clouds against the twilight sky paints a picture of serenity. Dressing in layers\u2014a soft sweater or light jacket over comfort\u2014will ensure you\u2019re ready for the quiet charm of the evening or perhaps an impromptu stroll along the Embarcadero, where the lights of the bay dance like fireflies on the water's surface. As you meander, consider grabbing a warm cup from a nearby caf\u00e9, savoring the moment surrounded by the echoes of laughter and the soft symphony of urban life.",
