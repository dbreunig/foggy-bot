    "weather_report": "The scenes before you reveal San Francisco wrapped in a thick gray embrace, a city cloaked in a blanket of clouds that stretches toward the Golden Gate, hinting at the hint of rain that looms just a few hours away. The day is caught in a cycle of cool dampness and the restless breath of the south wind, stirring the streets and rustling through the trees. Visibility is diminished, as the fog hangs low, weaving in and around the buildings, whispering secrets only familiar to the seasoned San Franciscan. \n\nAs the clock slides towards evening, the promise of rain beckons\u2014an invitation to cozy up indoors, perhaps with a good book and a cup of rich coffee. If you must venture out, it\u2019s wise to don layers; a warm jacket draped over a light sweater should serve you well against the brisk currents racing through the city. A stroll along the Embarcadero could unveil a captivating atmospheric dance of light as the clouds gather, but carry an umbrella, for the showers are expected to begin soon, unfurling throughout the night. Whether you seek the solace of a warm caf\u00e9 or the gentle rhythm of the rain against your window, tonight in San Francisco, the weather sings a lullaby of comfort from the gray skies above.",
