    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air is thick with the anticipation of rain. Clouds blanket the sky like a heavy quilt, obscuring the sharper outlines of the skyline. The temperature hovers around a cool 52 degrees, with a brisk southwesterly wind weaving through the streets. A gentle but persistent chance of rain lingers, promising a light shower after 11 PM, perhaps enough to refresh the earth but not so much to drown it. There\u2019s a sense of quiet stillness as if the city holds its breath, waiting for the heavens to open.\n\nLooking forward to Monday, the atmosphere lifts slightly with an expectation of partly sunny skies breaking through once the morning fog rolls away. The temperature may waver a bit, reaching highs near 60, but winds from the west and southwest maintain a playful touch, gusting up to 21 mph. Stand ready for splotches of rain before dusk, as a similar 40% chance hangs stubbornly over the day. \n\nFor those venturing out, a light jacket and comfortable layers will suffice, guarding against both the chill of the evening and the brisk winds of the afternoon. This is an ideal time for a leisurely stroll through the quiet streets, perhaps passing an open caf\u00e9 where the warm aromas of coffee beckon, or lingering in a bookstore, lost in the pages of a novel. Enjoy a sunset walk along the Embarcadero, listening to the distant foghorns echoing in the Bay as the city prepares for a night of reflective beauty.",
