    "weather_report": "A gentle warmth embraces Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, as the sunshine spills over the city\u2019s iconic skyline, weaving a tapestry of golden light. The day reveals a high near 70, with the temperature gracefully easing into the coolness of late afternoon, settling around 66. The west-southwest winds whisper through the streets at a brisk pace, occasionally gusting, adding a refreshing note to the air that invites a stroll along the waterfront or an outdoor caf\u00e9 visit. \n\nAs the sun dips lower, the skies remain partly cloaked in soft clouds, hinting at a relaxed evening ahead with a temperature dipping to around 56. The expected marine layer quietly lingers at the edges, yet the heart of the city basks in clarity and charm. Dress lightly but bring a light jacket for when the sun bows out, creating space for cozy gatherings under the dusk sky. Perhaps a leisurely walk through Golden Gate Park, or indulging in a quiet moment with a good book in a tucked-away caf\u00e9 would harmonize beautifully with today\u2019s serene offerings.",
