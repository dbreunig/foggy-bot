The low dips around 50, inviting a gentle chill that hangs in the air like a soft sigh. A light breeze drifts from the west-southwest, almost imperceptible at just 2 mph, creating a serene atmosphere ideal for quiet strolls beneath the muted city lights. As the evening progresses, the landscape transforms, gradual shifts in clarity hinting at a potentially moody start to Sunday.\n\nTomorrow promises a canvas of mostly cloudy skies, with temperatures peaking near 63 before gently retreating to the low 60s by afternoon. The southwest winds, picking up slightly to 2-6 mph, will wrap around you, urging a light layer\u2014a cozy sweater perhaps or a light jacket, serving both utility and style against the ever-present urban chill. The softened hues of the day suggest a gentle ambiance, perfect for casual explorations. Outdoor cafes beckon your presence, where one might indulge in a warm beverage and let the world drift by, or perhaps a leisurely visit to a local bookstore, embracing the simple pleasure of flipping through pages while the clouds paint stories overhead.",
