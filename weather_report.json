    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a refreshing coolness, teasing the hint of summer warmth to come. The day begins with a whisper of moisture before 9 AM, dissolving into a crisp blue sky that promises a high near 66 degrees. The west winds are setting the stage, rustling the trees and causing gentle waves along the waterfront\u2014though they are far from reckless with gusts only hinting at the playful side of nature. The clarity is remarkable, with the iconic shapes of the Golden Gate Bridge and the skyline standing out against the backdrop of a serene bay.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect mostly clear skies adorned with the soft glow of a fading sun, giving way to a cool night around 54 degrees. The west-southwest winds will continue to accompany your twilight stroll, their presence inviting yet gentle. Attire suitable for today would suggest layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater for the morning chill, shedding it in favor of a comfortable t-shirt by midday. As the sun dips lower, an additional layer may again be wise. Given these inviting conditions, one might explore the vibrant neighborhoods or engage in a leisurely picnic by the water, the sound of the waves lapping against the shore punctuating the evening with tranquility.",
