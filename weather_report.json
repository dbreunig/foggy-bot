    "weather_report": "This morning in Downtown San Francisco greets us with a gentle ambiance, marked by the faint patter of early drizzle which should give way to an inviting sunlit canvas as the day unfolds. With a high cresting near 67 degrees, those venturing out should consider a light layering; a soft scarf and light jacket may serve well against the mellow west wind, bending through the streets at 7 to 15 mph, accentuated by occasional gusts that dance playfully along the waterfront. \n\nAs the sun climbs higher, the skies promise a clearer enjoyment of one of San Francisco\u2019s famed afternoons, the fog rolling back to reveal the glinting skyline and distant vistas. However, as day transitions to evening, the clouds will return, bringing the possibility of more patchy drizzle, so a prepared spirit for the evening's cool embrace is wise. Though this day allows for pleasant outings\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park or a visit to a chic caf\u00e9 downtown\u2014it's best to embrace the dynamic nature of the weather and carry an umbrella just in case.",
