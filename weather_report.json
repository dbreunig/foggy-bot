    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a typical summer night unfolds under a cloudy sky, with temperatures gently whispering around 52 degrees. A mild west-southwest breeze brushes the landscape at about 10 mph, offering a subtle coolness that prompts an embrace of warmer layers. As dawn breaks, anticipation of the day\u2019s return to life blossoms, hinting at a transition to mostly sunny skies, where highs will flirt with a comfortable 62 degrees. The wind will continue to stir, dancing between 8 to 21 mph, with occasional gusts that might surprise those generous enough to linger outdoors.\n\nAs daylight emerges, the omnipresent marine layer will likely linger near the coast, draping the Golden Gate and perhaps cradling some of the northern views. Yet, it\u2019s a day that promises clarity; the sun peeking through will coax the city into a vibrant array of activity. For those stepping out, pairing layers with a light jacket will strike the right balance against the refreshing breeze and the cooler pockets of air that linger along the waterfront. A stroll through the local haunts, perhaps stopping at a quiet caf\u00e9 or browsing a favorite bookstore, could be the way to embrace this day\u2014a dance of sun and shadow, with the captivating city as your backdrop.",
