    "weather_report": "This evening, Downtown San Francisco greets us with a calm, slightly hazy charm, as the remnants of the day drift into night. The fading sunlight gives way to a soft, dusky palette, the skies transitioning from cerulean to muted gray, suggesting a serene but not entirely clear view of the skyline. While the sun has pushed temperatures to a comfortable bracket, the gentle winds whisper through the streets, adding a refreshing touch. The lack of heavy fog is notable; the marine layer stays somewhat at bay, allowing silhouettes of buildings to peek through as daylight wanes.\n\nAs night envelops the city, dressing in layers becomes a prudent choice, pairing a light jacket with a cozy sweater, suited for the cooling temperatures that will soon settle around fifty-two degrees. The allure of a leisurely stroll along Fort Mason or a quiet evening in one of the many intimate cafes beckons, perfect for unwinding after a bustling day. Whether you find peace in the pages of a novel or enjoy the light buzz of conversation among friends, tonight offers the kind of atmosphere that wraps around you like a familiar embrace, urging you to savor the unmistakable character of San Francisco.",
