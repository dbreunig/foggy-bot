    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun peeks through the marine layer, illuminating a landscape that remains crisp and cool as the day unfurls. Currently, the city benefits from mostly sunny skies, with temperatures hovering in the early 60s. However, don\u2019t be fooled by the brightness; as the afternoon beckons, you can expect a gentle drop, giving way to an inviting coolness. The air carries a whisper of the coast, with a light southwest breeze stirring at about 5 to 10 miles per hour, offering a refreshing lift to the day.\n\nAs evening approaches, the weather hints at a shift, with patchy fog expected to greet the early hours of the night. The cloud cover will weave itself around the city, bringing a hush to the bustling streets, with temperatures dipping to around 50 degrees. Best to dress in layers today\u2014perhaps a comfortable sweater under a light jacket, perfect for those uncertain transitions from sunlit strolls to cooler twilight moments. It\u2019s an ideal time to enjoy a peaceful walk by the waterfront or savor a quiet afternoon spent in a caf\u00e9, with a book or a thoughtful conversation serving as companions while the fog rolls in. Today\u2019s mellow vibes encourage simple pleasures, allowing you to embrace the beauty of San Francisco\u2019s unique character amidst the ever-changing weather.",
