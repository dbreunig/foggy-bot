    "weather_report": "As the hush of the night drapes over Downtown San Francisco, the skies are characterized by a gentle murmur of clouds, veiling the city in a calming embrace. Currently, temperatures nestle around a crisp 42 degrees, with a soft breeze whispering from the northeast at about 7 mph, hinting at the coolness of the early hours. This nocturnal tableau is readying itself for the dawn, which promises an awakening marked by a partly sunny visage, as the sun\u2019s ascent nudges the mercury to around 55 degrees before it softly retreats to a more tranquil 52 in the afternoon.\n\nAlthough the forecast holds little mention of fog, the presence of the marine layer is always a silent companion, occasionally creep into crevices between buildings, particularly towards the Golden Gate. For those venturing out this day, layering becomes paramount; a light jacket will keep you cozy against the brisk air while allowing for the comfort of movement as the sun stretches its arms open, spilling warmth across the city. Consider a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a casual exploration of the Mission\u2019s vibrant murals. As the heart of the city beats slowly awake, the day unfolds with possibilities that are anything but ostentatious, inviting a connection to the essence of urban life in its calm, contemplative moments.",
