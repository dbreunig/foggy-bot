    "weather_report": "Tonight, the essence of San Francisco will embrace you in a cool, quiet hug, the skies clear and unperturbed. The night's gentle chill rests at a comforting 52 degrees, with the soft whispers of a southwest breeze barely stirring the air. Walking the streets, the city unfurls its twinkling lights, each a reminder of the vibrant life that pulses beneath the darkened sky. Tomorrow promises a splendid sun-drenched day, where warmth spills forth, nudging temperatures to a delightfully mild 72 degrees before easing into a relaxed 66 by afternoon. \n\nAs the morning beckons, one can dress lightly, perhaps layering in anticipation of the coolness that often lingers near the coast, where the marine layer may still dance across the horizon. With the day unfurling like a well-loved book, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to the many cozy caf\u00e9s nestled between the city\u2019s iconic facades. Engage in simple pleasures, such as people-watching or grabbing an artisan pastry, basking in the essence of a San Francisco day well-spent.",
