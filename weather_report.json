    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun can be seen glimmering over Downtown San Francisco, casting a gentle light on the streets below as the temperature crests around a comfortable 67 degrees. A brisk west-southwest wind dances through the area, offering a refreshing element to the day, with gusts that make the air feel even livelier. As the sun descends, hints of patchy drizzle may whisper softly after midnight, suggesting a touch of moisture that could fall, though the chance remains slight.\n\nAs daylight dwindles, the vibrant clarity persists, but signs of the encroaching marine layer begin to reveal themselves in the air. A light layer of haze clings near the coastal edges, hinting that evening fog may soon weave its embrace around the city. If you step out now, a light jacket or a cozy sweater would be a wise companion, perfect for fending off the evening chill while allowing your skin to bask in the last traces of sun. Evening walks along the waterfront beckon, where you might find comfort in the tranquility of the bay, perhaps grabbing a seat at a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink and watch the world drift by as the golden hues of sunset turn to deeper blues.",
