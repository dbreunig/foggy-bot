Fog holds back, allowing the iconic structures like the Golden Gate Bridge to stand in majestic silhouette against the azure backdrop. As you step outside, consider layering your attire: a light sweater or jacket will serve well against the cool breeze as you traverse its lively streets. This is a splendid day for taking a moment at a local caf\u00e9, breathing in the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, or perhaps enjoying a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the beauty of the bay is unclouded.
