    "weather_report": "The early morning air of Downtown San Francisco carries with it a promise of mild transitions. As the mist from the nearby bay begins to retreat, the clarity of the day gradually unveils itself. Currently, the city boasts a cool embrace, with temperatures poised to hover around 60 degrees as the afternoon unfolds, slipping from the mild heights of 65 earlier in the day. The south-southwest wind whispers softly, blending a gentle movement through the neighborhoods. \n\nTonight, the skies will dim under a tapestry of partial clouds, giving rise to a calm atmosphere with lows settling in around 50 degrees. As you step out into this evolving landscape, consider dressing in layers to embrace the freshness of the air while remaining prepared for cool breezes that linger in the evening. It\u2019s the kind of day that invites a leisurely stroll through the tree-lined streets or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the scent of freshly brewed coffee might awaken your senses. The city seems to beckon for moments of quiet exploration and casual discovery as it balances on the cusp between the enchanting fogs of the morning and the retiring night.",
