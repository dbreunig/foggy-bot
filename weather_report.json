    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the air feels cool, a gentle embrace of the fog that's rolled in overnight, wrapping the hills in a light shroud of cloudy mystery. Currently, the city experiences a quiet pause; the clouds hover softly, but there\u2019s a promise of sunshine on the horizon. Forecasts suggest that as the day unfolds, the sun will pierce through, reaching a mild high that nudges towards 67. The southwest winds are mild, rustling through the streets, indicating a gentle but lively transition into a sunnier afternoon.\n\nThe early morning's cloudy visage hints at the presence of the marine layer, lingering especially in the western vistas toward the bridge. Fog will gradually dissipate, exchanging its cold grasp for warmth as the sun climbs higher into the sky. Wardrobe choices may range from layered shirts to light jackets, perfect for those seeking warmth against the gentle coastal breeze. With temperatures likely decreasing slightly later, those venturing outdoors, perhaps for a quiet stroll or a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9, may want to don something that allows for both comfort and flexibility. Today\u2019s inviting charm beckons exploration of the vibrant streets or a tranquil afternoon spent enjoying the city\u2019s quaint parks\u2014ideal for soaking up the warming afternoon light and the urban rhythm of a day near the bay.",
