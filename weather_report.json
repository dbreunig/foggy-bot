    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a crisp brightness dances across the sky, marking a clear day with that familiar San Francisco charm. Temperatures are on a gentle descent, settling around the comfortable 62-degree mark, greeted by a westerly breeze whispering through the streets. The slight wind, at around 13 miles per hour, offers a refreshing contrast to the warmth of the sun, creating an inviting atmosphere for those brave enough to enjoy it outdoors.\n\nLooking further ahead to tonight, the clouds will gradually gather, wrapping the city in a soft embrace as temperatures dip to a cozy 54 degrees. This transition invites a layer or two to fend off the evening chill, making sweater or light jacket an ideal choice as you wander through the streets or sip a warm espresso at your corner caf\u00e9. With the clear part of the day, this is a splendid opportunity to explore the quieter nooks of the city, perhaps taking a stroll along the waterfront or discovering hidden alleyways adorned with murals. As twilight creeps in, wrapping the city in its gentle twilight, consider gathering with friends for a relaxed evening of conversation and laughter. Such is the rhythm of a San Francisco afternoon, where each moment shares a story, beckoning you to enjoy the day before the night unfolds.",
