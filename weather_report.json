    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the sun casts its warm embrace upon the city, promising a day that will be both clear and inviting. The temperature gently rises to around 66 degrees, a crisp yet comfortable invitation for those venturing outside. A west-southwest breeze carries with it a lightness, gusting here and there, drawing attention to the soothing murmur of the Bay. \n\nThough the skies appear bright, remnants of the marine layer linger along the coastal edges, creating a soft veil that hints at the ever-present dance between ocean and city. It\u2019s a pleasant day, ideal for a leisurely stroll through the bustling streets or perhaps settling down at a caf\u00e9 with a good book, the kind of day that encourages one to don light layers\u2014think a breathable shirt under a light jacket to ward off any unexpected chill from the breeze. As the afternoon settles, the temperatures may dip slightly, drawing you into a cozy embrace as the sun begins its descent. A trip along the waterfront should provide both picturesque views and the gentle sound of waves, a perfect accompaniment to the euphoric calm that typifies a day like this.",
