    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over Downtown San Francisco, the morning reveals a city cloaked in a delicate veil of grey, with hints of warmth peeking through the clouds. There\u2019s a subtle whisper of drizzle lingering in the air, a soft reminder of the gentle marine layer that typically adorns the bay. The promise of a mostly sunny day is hinted at, yet the coolness of the breeze carries a palpable freshness that suggests layering might be the best approach to tackle the fluctuating temperatures. As the day progresses, expect the warmth to gently coax the mercury towards a comfortable 67, before retreating to a quieter, cooler 65 by afternoon.\n\nTonight, expect the softness of clouds to linger, with a slight chance of a bit more drizzle after 11 PM. The low will settle around a cozy 60, inviting those with evening plans to perhaps wrap up in a light jacket or sweater. This day calls for quiet yet fulfilling activities; perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the rhythmic lull of the bay meets the pulse of the city. The essence of San Francisco, steeped in its character, beckons exploration\u2014be it a leisurely coffee by the water or an afternoon visit to a local gallery, today is fashioned for simple pleasures amid the lingering grace of the city.",
