    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a touch of coolness, hinting at the crisp evening ahead. The clouds weave a delicate tapestry through the night sky, cloaking the city in a gentle embrace, while a light westerly wind whispers through the trees, sending a shiver of refreshment across the shoulders. Temperatures are expected to dip into the mid-50s, a reminder to dress warmly, perhaps layering a soft sweater beneath a light jacket, perfect for an evening stroll along the waterfront or a cozy gathering with friends in a nearby caf\u00e9.\n\nSunday heralds the arrival of brighter skies, with the sun poised to make a grand appearance. The day promises warmth, with highs reaching the mid-60s, casting a mellow glow over the streets. As the clouds vacate the stage, they'll reveal stunning cityscapes and the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, inviting exploration and admiration. The winds, surely a little gustier, could rustle the leaves and playfully lift a hat now and then. In this splendid ambiance, it\u2019s an opportune moment for a leisurely walk through Golden Gate Park or a quiet afternoon spent reading in one of San Francisco\u2019s many charming nooks, where the sunlight mingles with the remnants of summer.",
