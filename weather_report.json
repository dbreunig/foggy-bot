    "weather_report": "The night in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a blanket of cloud, the air tinged with a coolness that hints at the early whispers of spring. As dawn approaches, the fog dances on the edges, retreating toward the bay with a gentle caress while the city's lights flicker against the gathering light. In the coming hours, the clouds will part, revealing a mostly sunny day with temperatures rising to the comfortable low sixties. The breeze whispers tales of the West, blowing softly at six to twelve miles per hour, enhancing the pleasantness of the day.\n\nAs you step outside, consider a light jacket; it will provide just enough warmth against the morning chill while remaining easy to carry as the day grows brisker. The clarity of the skyline invites a stroll through the heart of the city\u2014perhaps indulging in a leisurely coffee by the waterfront or exploring one of the many parks that pepper the city\u2019s fabric. The marine layer may linger, suggesting that a touch of fog could wrap around the rooftops at times, but overall, it\u2019s a day to embrace the emerging sun and the myriad of experiences just waiting to unfold.",
