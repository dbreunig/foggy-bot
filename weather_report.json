    "weather_report": "As the night settles softly over downtown San Francisco, the streets lie quiet and serene beneath a gently clearing sky. The temperature hovers comfortably around fifty-one, accompanied by a mild southwest breeze that whispers through the bay. The forecast heralds a transition into a bright and sunny Tuesday, promising a peak warmth near sixty-three that will gradually dip to around sixty-one by the afternoon, all while the wind picks up, infusing the air with a brisk energy of up to twenty-one miles per hour.\n\nThe early morning hours have a distinct clarity amidst the fading mist, though hints of fog may linger around the coastal edges, subtly defining the horizon where land meets sea. As the sun begins its ascent, its light will likely disperse any residual haze, inviting residents out to embrace the warmth. Dressing in layers will serve well for the day ahead, with a light jacket or sweater advisable to counter the invigorating gusts. A stroll along the waterfront trails could be particularly rewarding today; perhaps a leisurely caf\u00e9 visit to savor a warm beverage while gazing out at the glistening expanse of the bay. With such a promising day on the horizon, there is no shortage of quiet charms waiting to be discovered in the heart of this vibrant city.",
