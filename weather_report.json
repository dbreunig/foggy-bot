    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle whisper of breeze plays through the streets, carrying with it the faint whisper of a drizzle that could intermittently tease the skyline tonight. A mostly clear expanse stretches above, with temperatures dipping just enough to layer a light jacket over your shoulders. The west-southwest wind, brisk but refreshing, dances through the air, hinting at the vibrant night still to come. \n\nLooking toward tomorrow, the sun is expected to emerge, casting golden rays over the city, warming the day and coaxing temperatures to a pleasant rise. Though a subtle chance of drizzle remains in the early morning, the forecast calls for bright clarity that invites adventure. With a high beckoning near to 67, one might find joy in a Sunday stroll through the local parks or a casual visit to a quaint caf\u00e9, where the warmth of freshly brewed coffee can match the burgeoning warmth of the day. A light sweater paired with comfortably casual attire seems fitting for this moment\u2014adequate for the softer edges of night and the sun\u2019s gentle embrace in the morning.",
