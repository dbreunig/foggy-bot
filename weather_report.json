    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a gentle morning unfolds beneath an azure sky, brightened by the sun's warm touch. With a high reaching around 67\u00b0F, the day appears alluring, though those familiar with the coast know the tempering effects the afternoon breezes can bring. The brisk west-southwest winds, lightly rustling through the streets at 5 to 15 mph, carry the promise of a sun-kissed yet cooling experience as temperatures slide to a more muted 65\u00b0F as the hours pass. Tonight, the skies will soften into a veil of partly cloudy serenity, embracing the city in a comfortable 56\u00b0F as night draws in, with breezes that whisper through the streets.\n\nWhile the sun may now reign supreme, the ever-watchful marine layer lurks just beyond the Golden Gate, subtly reminding the city that fog is but a breath away. For those stepping outside, light layers are advisable\u2014perhaps a sweater over a soft t-shirt, providing comfort as the day's warmth gives way to the cool evening air. The conditions invite one to enjoy simple pursuits: a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero to indulge in the sweeping views, or perhaps a quiet seat at a caf\u00e9 overlooking a bustling street, perfect for sipping coffee and watching life unfold. The day feels positively pleasant, a tender balance between warmth and the rejuvenating coolness that San Francisco does so well.",
