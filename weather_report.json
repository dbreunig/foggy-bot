    "weather_report": "In the stillness of this early morning, Downtown San Francisco is draped in a curtain of clouds, with the low rumble of thunder echoing off the hills. The air is charged with anticipation, heavy with moisture, and the scent of rain hangs like perfume. This Christmas Day ushers in severe thunderstorms, promising an orchestra of raindrops that will serenade the city until late morning. Those venturing out will find the temperature a cool 53 degrees, with gusts from the south whipping through the streets at nearly 40 miles per hour, inviting a briskness that chills to the bone.\n\nAs the storms advance, the fog, like a shy artist, may decide to cloak the Golden Gate once more, creating a mystical landscape where land meets sea in a dance of shadows and light. The marine layer is present, softening the outline of the skyline, allowing the glimmers of city lights to twinkle against the dark canvas of the sky. Dress for the day should lean towards practicality\u2014waterproof layers, a sturdy umbrella, and perhaps a warm hat to guard against the chill. With today\u2019s weather calling for indoor pursuits, one might find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, indulging in rich coffee and freshly baked pastries, or perhaps dive into the pages of a well-loved book while the storm plays its symphony outside.",
