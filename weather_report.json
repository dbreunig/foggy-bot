    "weather_report": "This afternoon, Downtown San Francisco showcases a promising blend of sunshine and gentle breezes, the type of weather that invites spontaneous walks along the waterfront or leisurely afternoons at a caf\u00e9. As the temperature hovers around a mild 65 degrees, a fresh westerly wind dances through the streets, occasionally gusting in playful bursts up to 30 mph. The air is crisp, yet the atmosphere remains welcoming, encouraging a light sweater or a jacket for comfort as the day transitions into evening.\n\nAs twilight approaches, clouds will gather like old friends returning for a reunion, draping the city in a comforting blanket that brings temperatures down to around 57. With the onset of the marine layer, one may find fog swirling gently around the city\u2019s iconic structures, particularly near the Golden Gate, softening the skyline with a touch of mystique. Whether spent wandering through the charming alleys of North Beach or nestled in a cozy spot with a good book after dusk, today offers a chance to embrace the eclectic spirit of San Francisco, creating connections in both the sunlit streets and the whispering fog.",
