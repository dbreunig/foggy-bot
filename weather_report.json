    "weather_report": "As the clock inches past midnight, Downtown San Francisco finds itself wrapped in a veil of gentle clouds, a harbinger of the tranquil night ahead. The current air is crisp, with temperatures dipping to around 50, while a steady west wind whispers through the streets, its dance stirring the leaves. The city, familiar with the embrace of fog, stands clear at this hour; the marine layer has retreated, making way for a star-speckled sky. \n\nTomorrow promises the warmth of the sun, shining brightly over the iconic landscape with temperatures edging toward the inviting mid-60s. This delightful weather invites an array of leisurely pursuits. Perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering bay meets the vibrant hum of city life, or a visit to the lush Haight-Asbury district, where the spirit of creativity flows as freely as the gentle breeze. A light jacket or sweater will suffice for the breezy moments, harmonizing comfort with the joy of exploring the city\u2019s nooks and crannies. Overall, it is a time to relish the budding warmth and clarity, a welcome prelude to the pleasant day that lies ahead.",
