    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a radiant sun, casting a warm, golden light over the cityscape. With temperatures hovering just above the comforting threshold of sixty degrees, the atmosphere buzzes with an invigorating clarity. Gentle winds from the west stir the air, a subtle reminder of the bay's cooling embrace, but today, the glory of the skies is largely unmarred; there is no fog creeping in to obscure this picturesque view of the Golden Gate Bridge or the iconic skyline that stretches proudly toward the heavens.\n\nAs evening approaches, the day promises a tranquil descent into night, with clear skies offering a soft backdrop for any leisurely evening pursuits. The low dipping around forty-seven suggests a slight chill might accompany your twilight stroll, so consider layering your attire\u2014a lightweight sweater or a light jacket would do well against the late breeze. Whether you choose to meander along the waterfront, savoring the fading hues of the sunset, or settle into a cozy caf\u00e9 with a book in hand, San Francisco invites you to relish these splendid conditions. Today, the city is alive with possibilities, served under a dome of blue and punctuated by the joy of mild springtime weather.",
