    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning begins draped in a gentle embrace of cloud cover, hinting at the serene moods of the Pacific. The warmth of the overnight air lingers, resting at a comfortable 54 degrees. As the day unfolds, a promise of intermittent sunlight teases through the clouds, forecasted to peak at about 64, only to allow a slow retreat into the cooler embrace of 61 later on. The light breeze from the west-southwest, dancing at around 7 mph, offers a refreshing touch that complements the mild temperatures.\n\nThe fog, a familiar companion in this coastal enclave, maintains a delicate presence, likely drifting near the Golden Gate and beyond, though it clings lightly to visibility, allowing the outlines of the cityscape to emerge softly. A light drizzle may grace the evening, but until then, the evolving clarity suggests a pleasant outing. Consider dressing in layers\u2014light sweaters or cardigans will ensure warmth without burden, perfect for a stroll along the Embarcadero, a visit to the farmers market for fresh produce, or perhaps enjoying an afternoon coffee at your favorite spot, watching the bustle of the city beside you. Take in the peace that only a fog-borne summer can provide, allowing the rhythm of San Francisco to guide your day.",
