    "weather_report": "In the quiet prelude to dawn, Downtown San Francisco lies serenely under a clear, blanket of stars, promising a day that beckons with the whisper of sun-kissed adventure. With the temperature gently cradling around the low fifties, a soft breeze from the west-southwest stirs, hinting at the freshness of the day ahead. As the sun rises, it will warm up, bringing a delightful peak of sixty-six degrees in the early afternoon before retreating to a comfortable sixty-four. \n\nWhile there is an initial blanket of night over the city, the light will soon tease out the details of the skyline, illuminating the Golden Gate and the intricate tapestry of urban life below. Fog, typically a charming companion to this coastal city, seems to keep its distance, allowing for a day filled with brightness and mild winds whispering through the streets. Those ready to step outside might consider layering lightly\u2014perhaps a lightweight jacket that can be easily stashed as warmth settles in, perfect for exploring the many nooks of the city or stopping for coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9. A stroll in one of the nearby parks, or visiting a local gallery, might be the ideal way to embrace the day, as the weather invites you to connect with the vivid pulse of San Francisco before the sun dips and evening shadows creep back in.",
