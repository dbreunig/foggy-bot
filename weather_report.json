    "weather_report": "As the sun sinks lower over Downtown San Francisco, the night air feels crisp and refreshing, with a gentle breeze stirring softly through the streets. The forecast hints at calmness, with tonight\u2019s sky expected to remain mostly clear, revealing the earth\u2019s carpet glittering under the moonlit glow. The temperature promises to settle around a cool 46 degrees, calling for layers to keep the chill at bay; a light jacket or sweater paired with comfortable trousers should suffice. Those drawn to the outdoors might find solace in a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero, where the twinkling lights of the Bay Bridge dance gracefully in the night.\n\nLooking toward Thursday, the dawn will usher in a bright and sunny day, with hints of warmer tones peeking through the cool morning air. The promise of a high near 60 encourages daytime wanderings through the city's parks or perhaps a visit to one of the many cozy caf\u00e9s that dot the landscape, where warm pastries and rich coffee await. While the usual coastal fog might linger at the fringes, the clarity of the day seems assured, allowing for unobstructed views across the bay. Embrace the day with comfort, using light layers that can transition seamlessly from the cool start to the warmth that will surely follow. There is much to savor in moments like these, where the city hums gently, inviting exploration and connection with its charm.",
