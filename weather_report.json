    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, the city's skyline begins to glow gently under a vast dome of mostly clear skies. The air is alive yet calm, a northwest breeze whispering at a pleasant 10 to 18 mph, occasionally teasing with gusts that dance up to 22 mph. The temperature, a lovely embrace of 51 degrees, invites a light jacket or sweater for those wandering the streets; the chill of the evening\u2019s approach is evident yet invigorating.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the sun promises to shine brilliantly, nudging highs near 70 before gracefully descending to a balmy 68 in the afternoon. It's a day destined to uplift spirits, with the kind of warmth that tells stories of golden hour adventures. Fog and the marine layer have taken refuge at sea, leaving the city unshrouded in mist, the iconic bridges and hills unmarred by the usual curtain of gray. This clarity suggests a perfect day to savor the small wonders; perhaps a leisurely walk through Golden Gate Park or a visit to one of the neighborhood caf\u00e9s, where the aroma of fresh pastries mingles with the inviting scent of brewed coffee. Evenings could find you in a cozy nook, the wind softly rustling outside, complementing a quiet read or the simple joy of savoring that last sip of tea.",
