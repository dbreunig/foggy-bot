    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this Monday in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle shroud of patchy fog drifts lazily, hinting at the remnants of the marine layer that brushes the city. The air is crisp and inviting, holding a temperature around fifty degrees, the kind that encourages you to bundle up just slightly in a light sweater or a comfortable jacket. As dawn approaches, the fog may linger briefly, especially near the waterfront, but soon the sun will break through, promising a delightful day ahead. The warmth of the afternoon will beckon people outside, with the high reaching toward the mid-sixties, a wonderful contrast that not only warms the skin but also the spirit.\n\nToday is perfect for a quiet wander through one of the city\u2019s many parks, perhaps Golden Gate Park, where the vibrant greens are now kissed by the sun, or along the Embarcadero, where the sparkling bay glimmers with possibilities. There's an inviting allure for those who find joy in the simple act of sipping coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, watching the early morning hustle while planning the day's endeavors. As you step out today, a light layer will serve you well against the crispness of the morning, peeling it off as the day unfolds, revealing a climate that is warm, sunny, and irresistibly cheerful\u2014ideal for embracing the beauty of your surroundings.",
