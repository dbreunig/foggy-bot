    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfurls beneath a mostly sunny sky, casting a gentle warmth that seems to dance off the asphalt. The temperature hovers around a comfortable 64 degrees, gradually settling into the cooler embrace of the mid-60s as the afternoon progresses. A relaxed west-southwest breeze, occasionally gusting, adds a fresh note to the air, hinting at the shifting tides of the evening to come. \n\nAs twilight approaches, a whisper of drizzle is anticipated after two in the morning, cloaking the city in a veil of clouds and gentle dampness, with a low slipping toward 56. The marine layer has yet to fully show itself, leaving the iconic Golden Gate Bridge momentarily unsullied by fog while the city\u2019s outlines sharp and clear\u2014a moment that beckons you to stroll its streets. Such weather invites the prudent traveler to dress in layers, combining a light sweater with a breathable outer garment that stands ready for the evening chill. With the day waning, consider a quiet walk along the Embarcadero, perhaps pausing to let the cool breeze play through your hair as you reflect on the gentle undulations of the Bay. It\u2019s a day made for simple joys, a leisurely pause in the bustling rhythm of city life.",
