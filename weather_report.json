    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sun glimmers through a veiled sky, the golden rays cutting through the cool maritime air. With a high hovering just around 60, it\u2019s a day that holds the promise of warmth while the wind, brushing in from the west-southwest at a brisk pace, adds a refreshing edge. The air feels clear, though hints of a lingering marine layer may nestle just beyond the bay. As dusk beckons, the temperature is set to dip, offering a gentle embrace as the evening unfolds.\n\nTonight unveils a partly cloudy expanse, and with a drop to about 50 degrees, a light jacket or sweater will serve as a comfortable companion for those venturing out. It\u2019s the kind of evening that invites you to explore quieter streets or perhaps sip a warm drink in the company of friends as the city\u2019s skyline softens into the twilight. While fog may dapple the edges, the heart of downtown remains vibrant, alive with the subtle hum of urban life.",
