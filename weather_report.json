    "weather_report": "As the night blankets Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a tender chill, whispering of clarity yet to come. Under the dark canvas of the sky, the city sleeps peacefully, with temperatures lingering around a mild 57. The gentle sway of a southwest wind stirs the leaves, promising a day of warmth and sun. As morning breaks, the golden hues will unfurl, illuminating the city\u2019s iconic skyline against a backdrop of blue, reaching for a high of 71 before retreating to a comfortable 68 by afternoon.\n\nThe forecast speaks of clear skies, a rare gem for these shores. While hints of fog may linger along some coastal edges, the heart of the city will bask in unobstructed light, inviting residents to step outside, enjoy the warmth, and revel in the freshness of the day. For the best experience, a light sweater or a comfortable long-sleeve shirt will suffice for the early hours, transitioning into short sleeves as the sun rises higher. With a day as beautiful as this, consider wandering through the local parks or perhaps indulging in a leisurely stroll along the waterfront where the air is crisp and the views are nothing short of breathtaking. As the sunset approaches, sipping a warm drink at a cozy caf\u00e9 while soaking in the last golden rays would be a perfect way to end a Sunday in the heart of San Francisco.",
