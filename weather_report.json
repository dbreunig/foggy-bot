    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle whisper of fog begins to roll in from the Pacific, wrapping the city in a soft, silken embrace that lingers delicately in the air. Tonight, expect temperatures to drift down to a mild 50 degrees, accompanied by a light west-southwest wind that brushes past like a friendly hand. The clouds scatter intermittently, revealing hints of a clear sky that might dance with stars if the fog allows.\n\nLooking toward Saturday, anticipate the morning to greet you with patchy fog, creating an atmospheric canvas that transitions into a mostly sunny day, where the sun casts its golden rays across the muted hues of the cityscape. However, temperatures will stay subdued, peaking near 59 before gently falling to around 56 in the afternoon. The light winds promise a refreshing bite, ideal for a light jacket or sweater. As you navigate the cobbled streets, consider leisurely pursuits; perhaps a stroll through the quieter lanes or a visit to one of the many cozy caf\u00e9s that populate the vibrant neighborhoods, where warmth is found in both the atmosphere and the conversations that fill the air.",
