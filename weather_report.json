    "weather_report": "As the sun gently rises over Downtown San Francisco, the city greets the day under a mostly sunny sky, adorned with a light breeze whispering through the streets. The temperature is expected to dance around a delightful 66 degrees, easing into a cooler 63 by afternoon. This moderate warmth beckons both early risers and late-morning wanderers, inviting them to stroll along the waterfront or perhaps find a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a warm cup of coffee. \n\nThe air remains tinged with crispness, a reminder that even as the clouds recede, traces of the marine layer linger in the distance, painting a soft veil over the Golden Gate Bridge and hinting at the city's complex relationship with fog. Tonight, the skies will transition to a partly clouded canvas, making way for a tranquil evening, perfect for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or an intimate dinner with friends. Selecting layers is wise; light jackets will keep warmth close, preserving comfort whether perched on a park bench or taking a closer look at the bay\u2019s enduring charm. Engaging with the day feels inviting; perhaps a visit to a gallery or market would satisfy the spirit, embracing all that this city, ever alive with texture and story, has to offer.",
