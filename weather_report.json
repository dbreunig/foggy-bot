The forecast offers a reprieve from the day\u2019s warmth, with partly cloudy skies nodding to a serenity that is as comforting as a well-worn blanket. Soft winds sweep in from the west-southwest, whispering through the streets, a reminder of the city\u2019s ever-shifting maritime breath. Although remnants of fog flirt along the edges of the bay, the city itself holds a clarity that invites evening wanderings.\n\nTomorrow promises sunshine, wrapping the day in a warmth that will cascade to the mid-sixties by afternoon. As the light brightens, the air will gain a playful edge from the southwest winds, transforming urban walks into idyllic explorations. For tonight, a light jacket or sweater would be prudent as you step out to enjoy a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a moment on a cozy caf\u00e9 terrace, where conversation mingles with the night air. In the morning, as the sun rises with radiant assurance, consider a light layering strategy\u2014comfortable and breezy for a city that embraces the open air and the collective hum of its vibrant life.",
