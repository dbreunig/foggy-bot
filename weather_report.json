    "weather_report": "As the clock winds down towards midnight, the air in Downtown San Francisco feels layered with a hint of chill, an invitation to draw one's scarf a little tighter. The lower temperatures flirt with the edges of discomfort, hovering around 50 degrees while a gentle north wind drifts through the streets. Nighttime clouds hang overhead, a precursor whispering of possible rain that may return before dawn, when the city can expect scattered drops to kiss the pavement and a glimmer of moisture in the air. \n\nTomorrow brings a promise of contrast: a flicker of sunshine may break through, but expect the sky to toggle between sun and shadow, with high temperatures gently easing up to just shy of 60. The breeze may pick up, gusting sporadically, allowing for an invigorating walk always under the watchful gaze of the iconic landmarks. As the fog creeps closer, especially towards the coastline, dressing in layers becomes essential\u2014sweaters and light jackets will serve as allies against the potential chill and unpredictability of the day ahead. It\u2019s a fine time to explore quaint cafes or wander among local art galleries, soaking up the vibrant pulse of the city while remaining ever aware of the shifting clouds.",
