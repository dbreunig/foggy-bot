    "weather_report": "As the evening drapes its cool cloak over Downtown San Francisco, the city finds itself wrapped in a gentle veil of clouds. With a low lingering around the comfortable 54 degrees, the west southwest winds whisper through the streets, weaving together the scents of the bay and hints of salt from the ocean breeze. Though the horizon hints at a golden glow, a marine layer holds its presence, suggesting that the familiar fog may still linger at the edges, softening the silhouettes of the iconic skyline and the elegant arches of the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of a mostly sunny day greets us, with temperatures awakening to a high near 64, easing back into the pleasant embrace of 61 by afternoon. The winds will continue to dance a lively jig, gusting as they sweep through the avenues, adding a dash of energy to the morning bustle. In this atmospheric mosaic, where clouds waltz with sunshine, a light jacket layered over a comfortable shirt will serve you well as you venture out to savor the local caf\u00e9s or stroll through the tranquil parks. Engage with the city's nuanced rhythm; perhaps it\u2019s a perfect moment to linger over a book at a caf\u00e9 or take a leisurely walk along the waterfront, absorbing the unique atmosphere that San Francisco offers during this transitional season.",
