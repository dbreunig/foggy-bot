The temperature hovers near a crisp 56 degrees, emboldened by a brisk west wind brushing past at 16 to 20 mph, gusts peaking at 28 mph, making the air feel both sharp and invigorating. The distant peaks are shrouded in an enigmatic mist, suggesting the presence of a light marine layer that veils some of the city\u2019s iconic backdrops while offering tantalizing glimpses of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the forecast hints at lingering showers and a slight chance of thunderstorms, which may further gild the evening\u2019s allure. With temperatures dipping to a cool 46 degrees under a mostly clear sky, it beckons one to don layers\u2014an essential lightweight sweater embraced by a windproof jacket would serve well on this breezy day. This weather invites an easy stroll through the city\u2019s lively streets, perhaps exploring new cafes or indulging in a quiet moment at a park before returning home.
