    "weather_report": "Under the evolving light of a San Francisco morning, today promises a delightful blend of sun and brisk winds. As daylight breaks, the skyline is kissed with golden rays, while the air is infused with a fresh chill that heralds summer's arrival against the storied backdrop of the City by the Bay. The forecast calls for high temperatures nearing a comfortable 62 degrees, gradually cooling to about 60 by afternoon, propelled by a west wind rustling through the streets at 18 to 24 mph, and gusts that dance as high as 35 mph. \n\nThe clarity of the day appears promising, with the fog that is often a companion of these coastal realms largely retreating to distant horizons. Although wisps may linger at the edges, the heart of the city shows itself, a canvas for exploration. Given the coolness lingering in the air, a light jacket or sweater is recommended\u2014one perfect for layering, allowing for comfort whether close to the breeze or in the warmth of midday sun. With such a quaint yet vibrant atmosphere beckoning, a stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 where one can sip a warm beverage while watching the world wake around you may be just the ticket to savor the spirit of the day.",
