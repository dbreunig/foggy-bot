    "weather_report": "As the hour settles into the quiet of the night, Downtown San Francisco brims with an understated allure. The sun has retreated, leaving behind a tranquil backdrop, kissed by gentle hues of twilight. Current conditions reveal a clear, star-speckled expanse above, with the warmth of the day yielding to a comfortable embrace that hovers near 56 degrees. The enticing possibility of light drizzle after eleven casts a delicate anticipation over the evening, a whisper of the ocean\u2019s presence that often brushes the city at night.\n\nTomorrow promises a delightful sun-soaked atmosphere, with the day expected to edge toward 63 degrees. The robust west-southwest winds will dance around the city, offering a refreshing breeze that teases the hair and invigorates the spirit. The marine layer will linger, perhaps shrouding parts of the coastline in wispy fog, ready to sweep in as the evening sun disappears behind the horizon. Dress in layers\u2014think a light sweater or a stylish jacket\u2014to navigate the fluctuating temperatures with ease. For an evening stroll along the waterfront or a quiet gathering at an outdoor caf\u00e9, wrap yourself in comfort while indulging in the vibrant city life, letting the soft sounds of laughter and conversation blend harmoniously with the backdrop of distant waves.",
