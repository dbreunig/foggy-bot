    "weather_report": "In downtown San Francisco, the day dawns with a mix of partly sunny intervals and a whispering chill in the air, hinting at the forthcoming embrace of the evening clouds. As the sun climbs, temperatures linger in the low 60s, dipping slightly as the afternoon progresses. A gentle south-southwest wind carries with it whispers of rain, a 30% chance looming on the horizon, particularly after the clock ticks past five. The city\u2019s iconic skyline remains partially veiled, with hints of fog curling around the Golden Gate, softly framing the majesty of its arches against the backdrop of an indifferent sky. \n\nAs the sun paints the morning with fleeting warmth, dressing in layers becomes essential; a light jacket will serve well against the cool breeze and potential late-day precipitation. The scene suggests a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet afternoon in one of the city's myriad cafes, reveling in the hum of urban life. For those looking for solace, a visit to the local museums might offer refuge from the unpredictable weather. Today invites a gentle curiosity, as long as one is prepared for the subtle shifts in the day's temperament.",
