    "weather_report": "Under a sky draped in a veil of mottled gray, Downtown San Francisco embraces a mood that straddles the line between the invigorating and the somber. Today\u2019s weather, quintessentially coastal, begins with the sun making fleeting appearances, offering brief respites from the overarching cloud cover. As the day unfolds, temperatures will gently descend, settling around 56 degrees, a reminder that while winter has passed, the marine influence lingers, affecting the air with its signature coolness. \n\nThis afternoon promises a gentle west-southwest breeze, a subtle touch that invites a light jacket or layered attire. Those venturing out might find the ambiance well-suited for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the muted light casts a uniquely cinematic quality over the bay. Perhaps a visit to one of the neighborhood caf\u00e9s, where the warmth of freshly brewed coffee can meld with the cool air outside, could serve as an ideal refuge. As night falls and temperatures dip to around 49, the clouds will deepen, wrapping the city in a cool embrace, yet a sense of tranquility will prevail, making it a perfect evening for quiet reflections or intimate gatherings indoors.",
