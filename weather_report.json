    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a palpable uncertainty, hinting at the rain that may grace the early hours. Tonight\u2019s low languishes around 49, with a gentle west-southwest breeze whispering through the city, as clouds weave a tapestry overhead. A 30% chance of rain looms, promising moisture to the streets that are often animated with late-night wanderers, yet the sky remains largely an unseen canvas.\n\nTuesday approaches with a similar mood, where the clouds will linger as a somewhat obstructive blanket, imbuing the day with its muted palette. The temperature will hover close to 57, dipping slightly as the afternoon unfolds. A whisper of 50% chance of rain suggests a fleeting shower, perhaps enough to glisten on pavement without saturating it entirely, offering a momentary reprieve from the bustling world. Dressing in layers is advisable: perhaps a light raincoat for any unannounced sprinkles, coupled with a cozy sweater, as well as comfortable shoes for those who might find comfort in strolling through the city streets or savoring a warm cup of coffee in a cozy nook. The enveloping gloom may seem drearier to some, but there exists a certain charm on rainy days\u2014a serenade of raindrops on rooftops and the enticing scent of the earth replenished, inviting a quiet moment of reflection. Engaging in simple delights such as a bookshop visit, perusing titles while the gentle rhythms of rain patter outside, could provide a perfect escape.",
