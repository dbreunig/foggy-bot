    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the air is calm and mostly clear, inviting those who find solace in the coolness of the evening to venture outside. With a gentle west-southwest breeze blowing, the low temperature around 59 offers a refreshing breeze that wraps around you, perfect for a light cardigan or a cozy scarf. As dawn breaks on Sunday, the sun will rise to cast its golden rays on the city, promising a delightful day ahead. The weather will be predominantly sunny, with temperatures reaching a pleasant high of about 74. The winds may stir up a vibrant dance, reaching speeds of up to 17 mph, occasionally gusting even higher. \n\nFor today, the sky seems to hold no traces of the fog that often graces our shores. Instead, it appears to invite us into the clear embrace of a transition from summer\u2019s warmth into autumn\u2019s gentle touch. It's the perfect day to wander through the city\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods, perhaps indulging in a leisurely brunch at a local caf\u00e9, where the enticing aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air. Or, for the more adventurous at heart, a stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a nearby park to catch a whiff of the bay breeze would rejuvenate the spirit. As the sun climbs, don lightweight attire, but keep a light layer handy for when the evening draws near.",
