    "weather_report": "The sun is casting its golden light over Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, knitting a tapestry of warmth amidst the cool breeze. A gentle northeasterly wind brushes against your skin, while the crisp clarity of the day offers a pleasant embrace, edging temperatures near a comfortable 67 degrees as they settle down to around 65. The expansive blue sky leaves little room for doubt; the fog has decided to remain absent, its marine layer nowhere in sight. Instead, there is a shimmering brilliance that speaks of exploration and respite.\n\nAs the day inches towards evening, the clear skies will make way for a gentle descent in temperature, falling to a cozy 50 degrees tonight. With this blend of late-winter warmth and evening chill, consider dressing in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater accompanied by a jacket for later, when the night whispers of coolness but still offers a peaceful respite. As the afternoon unfolds, why not wander through the city's vibrant streets, indulge in a cozy caf\u00e9, or stroll along the waterfront? Wherever you choose to roam, today beckons with the kind of clarity that invigorates the spirit and holds the promise of simple joy.",
