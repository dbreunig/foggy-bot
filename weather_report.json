    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks quietly over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds hangs just above the skyline, lending a cool and mellow embrace to the waking city. This morning, temperatures hover around a soft 59 degrees, with a light breeze from the west southwest that whispers through the streets, a reminder of the ocean's nearby presence. The day promises a gradual unveiling of sunshine, and by midday, the warmth will rise to a comfortable 69, only to retreat slightly by afternoon. The winds will pick up, creating a playful dance of leaves and the soft rustling of trees.\n\nThe marine layer lingers in the distance, perhaps giving a hint of fog swirling around the Golden Gate Bridge, painting a mysterious backdrop that often defines the character of this remarkable city. Nevertheless, clarity is on the horizon; the clouds will part, allowing that celebrated California sunshine to seep through. Dress in layers today\u2014perhaps a light jacket that can be shed as the warmth blankets the streets, along with comfortable shoes for exploring. It\u2019s an ideal day to amble along the waterfront, relishing a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9, or finding solace in one of the city\u2019s many parks. In this peaceful morning light, with the promise of clearer skies ahead, San Francisco invites a simple, serene day of discovery.",
