    "weather_report": "In the tranquil embrace of Downtown San Francisco tonight, the skies remain mostly clear under the watchful gaze of the stars. The gentle caress of a west-southwest breeze whispers secrets of the sea, inviting those who find joy in nocturnal wanderings to venture out into the crisp air. With temperatures softly cradling you at around 44, it\u2019s a serene moment to revel in the city's vibrant nightlife, perhaps pausing for a warm drink at a cozy caf\u00e9 or enjoying the twinkling lights from a vantage point.\n\nAs dawn approaches tomorrow, clouds will begin to drift in, heralding the possibility of rain after the clock strikes 5 pm. The day may usher in a patch of sun before the clouds finalize their takeover, aiming for a high near 57. The air will carry the scent of impending rain, with the promise of a gentle shower kissing the landscape by evening. Given the anticipated warmth of the day, a layered ensemble will serve you well; think a light sweater to combat the chill of the morning, yet one that can be shed as the sun makes its fleeting appearance before retreating to the clouds. With the backdrop of a rainy evening approaching, it would be a delightful time to browse the local art galleries or visit a bookstore, absorbing the essence of the city, serene yet vivid, before the weather shifts and the rhythm of droplets begins to dance on the pavement.",
