    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the skies unfold in a vibrant blue, kissed by the warm embrace of the sun as it rises to a comfortable peak near 72 degrees. A gentle west wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it a touch of ocean air that invigorates the city. The clarity of the day is striking; the Golden Gate stands resolute against a backdrop of distant hills, visible for all to admire without the usual curtain of fog. This sun-drenched canvas invites a sense of lightness, a perfect time to wander the scenic avenues or park your thoughts over a leisurely outdoor lunch.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the charm of the evening will settle in with partly cloudy skies and a cool breeze sweeping in from the west southwest, dipping temperatures to a soft low around 52. A light jacket or a cozy sweater will serve you well as you step out into the dusk. With the twilight transforming the skyline into a palette of muted colors, a stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 would suit the mood beautifully. Take a moment to savor a warm drink, allowing the gentle rhythms of the city to wash over you as the day gracefully transitions into night.",
