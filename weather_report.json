    "weather_report": "As the sun begins its ascent over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of cloud lingers, hinting at the remnants of last night's marine layer. Currently, the air is cool and inviting, with a gentle breeze stirring at about 12 miles per hour. Fog may still cling to some coastal edges, whispering softly along the Golden Gate, while the loftier heights promise a gradual awakening to daylight. As we transition into midday, expect the clouds to part, revealing a mostly sunny sky; temperatures will stray into the mid-60s, yet may dip slightly by afternoon, adapting to the shifting atmospheric sentiments.\n\nToday, it beckons you to take pleasure in the brisk, invigorating air. A light jacket or layered attire will serve you well as you navigate the changing warmth throughout the day. Perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront will allow you to embrace both the scenic beauty and the fresh ocean breeze. Or consider settling into a quiet caf\u00e9, where a warm cup of coffee can accompany your reflections. The weather promises a day that holds much potential for contemplation and enjoyment\u2014worthy of savoring the unique essence of a San Francisco morning.",
