    "weather_report": "As evening descends on Downtown San Francisco, a light veil of clouds blankets the city, promising a night where temperature lingers gently around 56 degrees. There is a soft whisper of wind cradling the city, blowing from the west southwest, a reminder of nature's graceful presence. The air carries with it the faint possibility of drizzle, a meager 20% chance that adds a hint of romance and mystery to the ambiance. \n\nLooking ahead to the day to come, the morning might awaken with a slight chance of drizzle, subtle enough to go unnoticed against the backdrop of a partly sunny sky. Daytime temperatures will flirt with the mid-60s, before drifting down into the comforting embrace of early evening. For those braving the elements, layers will serve you well; a light jacket will be your ally as you navigate the city streets, while a warm scarf can add a touch of comfort against the fresh air. It\u2019s a perfect day for a leisurely stroll through the Embarcadero, perhaps followed by a quiet moment in a cozy caf\u00e9, watching the world pass by, or delving into a good book amidst the gentle sounds of the city.",
