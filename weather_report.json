    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the day begins on a bright note, with the sun casting a gentle glow over the city\u2019s iconic silhouettes. The predicted warmth of 62 degrees feels pleasant against the skin, accentuated by a brisk west wind that dances through the streets at 18 to 25 mph. The scene is mostly clear, the sky unfolding in shades of blue, while hints of marine layer linger at the edges of the horizon, teasing the possibility of fog but largely retreating for now.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clarity will soften into a more serene night, with temperatures easing to about 52 degrees. The winds will quiet, settling into a gentle whisper, making it an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero. The crisp air invites layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a tailored jacket to ward off the evening chill. A coffee in hand, one might bask in the quiet beauty of the waterfront or engage with friends at an outdoor caf\u00e9, soaking in the lingering daylight. Today is a canvas painted with the promise of an invigorating city adventure, whether it be an informal gathering or a solitary moment reflecting on the lively streets.",
