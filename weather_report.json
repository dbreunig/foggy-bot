    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, a pleasant sunlight bathes the city, a gentle warmth spilling over the charming streets, highlighted by a high near 63 degrees. As the afternoon approaches, expect temperatures to settle around 61, under the watchful gaze of a crisp west wind, softly whispering through the alleyways. With tonight\u2019s forecast promising mostly clear skies and cool depths dipping to around 50, the evening invites leisurely strolls and gatherings under the stars, as a westerly breeze adds a refreshing touch. \n\nThe day presents a predominantly cloudless tableau, with just enough cloud cover to offer contrasting textures against the azure backdrop. Fog, that cherished companion of the Bay, seems to hold its breath for now, leaving the iconic vistas unburdened by the marine layer. Given the day\u2019s amiability, dressing in layers would serve well\u2014perhaps a light shirt with a cozy jacket for the evening chill, bridging comfort between the warmth of the sun and the cool dusk. An afternoon visit to a caf\u00e9, a gentle meander through the parks, or simply sitting by the water\u2019s edge to absorb the tranquil allure of the city sounds like the ideal way to soak in what this splendid weather has to offer.",
