    "weather_report": "As the city nestles into the cool embrace of night, wisps of fog begin to weave through the streets, their presence a soft blanket wrapping the world in mystery. The air is tinged with the freshness of moisture, while temperatures linger comfortably around 56 degrees. The gentle west-southwest breeze, modest yet persistent at ten to fifteen mph, whispers through the trees, hinting at the dance of the night ahead. For those venturing out, a light jacket or sweater would provide just the right touch of warmth against the slight chill, making evening strolls along the waterfront a most pleasant endeavor.\n\nAs dawn unfurls its glory on Sunday, the fog will gradually lift, revealing a canvas of blue punctuated by the golden hues of sunlight. Areas of fog will linger until mid-morning, offering a serene start before the day brightens to a refreshing high of around 70 degrees. The breeze, picking up in the afternoon to twenty-one mph at times, will add a lively rhythm to the air. Dress in layers to accommodate the shifting temperatures, perhaps opting for a light shirt beneath a cardigan, perfect for wandering through the park or enjoying a casual brunch at an outdoor caf\u00e9. Embrace the moments of clarity, as the day promises both beauty and comfort, inviting you to savor each detail that makes this city a timeless gem along the coast.",
