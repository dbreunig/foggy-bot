    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night is draped in a gentle blanket of clouds, with the temperature lounging just above the comfort of 57 degrees. A whisper of a north wind stirs, barely rustling the stillness of the early hours. Morning will greet the city with a promising shift; mostly sunny skies will emerge, allowing the sun to unfurl its warmth and spread a glow across the day's unfolding tapestry, peaking near 74 before gracefully retreating to a cooler 64 as the afternoon progresses. \n\nThe air will feel mild and fresh, inviting ventures outdoors. One might consider donning a light sweater or a long-sleeved shirt to complement the warmth of the sun while preparing for a possible chill that creeps in with the early evening haze. Ideal activities may include a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the sea\u2019s rhythmic whispers mingle with the city\u2019s heartbeat, or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s tranquil parks, where one can sip a coffee, reveling in the vibrant yet calm atmosphere that a San Francisco afternoon can offer. As the day wanes, the familiar fog may roll in with its soft embrace, offering a soothing backdrop to the evening's sing-song of city life.",
