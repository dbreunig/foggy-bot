A light drizzle may whisper from the heavens after dawn, heralding an onset of clouds, with the air gently tugged by a west-southwesterly breeze. The temperature lingers around a mild 56 degrees, comfortable yet cool enough to suggest a light sweater or a sprightly jacket may be wise choices for the hours to come. \n\nAs the day unfurls, clouds will swell and swirl above, teasing the prospect of rain before the clock strikes five. The afternoon is poised to flirt with a high near 63, while gusts might bring a spirited edge to the cooling breeze. For those keen on embracing the day, a stroll to savor the unique architecture, perhaps alongside a quick stop for a warm beverage, could provide a welcomed interlude. The marine layer hangs low, hinting at fog settling in familiar corners of the city, offering that enigmatic ambiance found only in this coastal refuge. Thus, layering becomes the mantra\u2014an embrace of comfort against the unpredictable pulse of San Francisco\u2019s weather.",
