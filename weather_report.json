    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks softly over Downtown San Francisco, a blanket of mostly cloudy skies remains, lending an air of hushed anticipation to the morning. The low temperature hovers in the comfortable mid-fifties, while a gentle west-southwest wind teases the rooftops at about six miles per hour. The atmosphere possesses that familiar San Francisco charm, although the sun's initially shy ascent may grant the city a somewhat muted palette, with hints of brightness still obscured by the clouds.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect those clouds to dissipate and yield to the sun, which will grace the city with its gentle warmth. The high should reach the pleasant low sixties, dipping slightly in the afternoon. You'll feel the breezy winds, occasionally gusting up to twenty miles per hour, providing a refreshing counterpoint to the day\u2019s warmth. Fog may be just a lingering whisper near the coast, teasing the Golden Gate, but its presence likely won\u2019t encroach upon your urban plans. \n\nAs you consider what to wear, think of layers\u2014a light sweater or long-sleeved shirt paired with comfortable trousers will do well, guarding against the chill of the morning breeze and the potential drop in temperature come afternoon. With such promising weather, a stroll through a local market or a leisurely exploration of the city\u2019s iconic caf\u00e9s would be delightful. The charming streets, now illuminated by the sun's warm gaze, invite you to embrace the simple pleasures of the day\u2014perhaps with a coffee in hand, watching the city bustle and basking in its serene beauty.",
