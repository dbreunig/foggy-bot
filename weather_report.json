    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the skies stretch above like a canvas, brushed with soft hues of fading light. Currently, the air is mostly clear, hinting at a comfortable night ahead with a gentle breeze whispering from the west. Temperatures hover around a mild 55 degrees, making it an inviting time for a stroll or an evening gathering. The clarity of the evening augurs well for stargazers, though pockets of the marine layer may linger just off the coast, hinting at the typical San Francisco fog that often rolls in with the night.\n\nLooking towards tomorrow, the promise of a sunlit day unfolds, with afternoon highs reaching a pleasant 66 degrees. The sunlight will warm the city, but as the day wears on, it will gracefully retreat to a cooler state, dipping toward the low 60s. Dress in layers: a light sweater paired with a comfortable shirt will suffice in the morning and as the day warms, a breezy jacket will become your friend against the interludes of light winds. Seize the moments to explore the neighborhood caf\u00e9s, relish in the local bookshops, or simply enjoy a leisurely public park visit, taking in the subtle beauty of a San Francisco morning.",
