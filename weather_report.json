    "weather_report": "The calm of the night in Downtown San Francisco is ushering in a serenely cool air with the temperature resting comfortably around 51 degrees. The winds, gentle yet spirited, are brushing through with a light west-southwest breeze, keeping the atmosphere crisp. As dawn breaks, the city is poised to embrace a sunny Tuesday, promising a delightful high near 66 degrees. The warmth will settle in gradually, melding with cool breezes expected throughout the day, complementing the lingering traces of low-lying fog that sometimes lingers close to the water's edge.\n\nAs the sun ascends and fills the golden hues across the skyline, it banishes shadows and imposes clarity, making the iconic vistas of the Golden Gate Bridge undeniably enchanting. Should you wish to step outside, consider donning layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket to fend off the morning chill, transitioning to comfortable attire as the warmth emerges. The day is inviting, ideal for leisurely strolls through the Embarcadero or a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s charming parks, where the sights and sounds weave together, creating an everyday tapestry of urban life. It\u2019s an occasion to engage in that fleeting magic, as the fog scuttles off to the embrace of the sea, allowing San Francisco to beam brightly.",
