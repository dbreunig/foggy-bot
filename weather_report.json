    "weather_report": "As the quiet night drapes over Downtown San Francisco, the air feels crisp and invites a sense of stillness. The city rests beneath a canopy of mostly clear skies, with the low temperature dipping to a comfortable 51 degrees. A gentle breeze from the west-southwest whispers through the streets, promising a transition into a sunlit day.\n\nCome Sunday, the sun will rise to unveil a spectacular, bright day, with temperatures anticipated to warm to around 66 degrees. The horizon will stretch wide and clear, defining a palette of blues and warm golden hues, glazed by a soft wind ranging from a light sigh to a playful gust of up to 22 mph. The fog, that notorious character of the San Francisco landscape, may still linger at the fringes but will mostly retreat, making way for the clarity of the day. Ideal attire would weave in layers, a light sweater tucked beneath a casual jacket, ensuring warmth against the morning chill, yet allowing for comfort as the sun climbs higher. \n\nA stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely coffee on a sunlit terrace could be the perfect way to embrace this splendid day. The city awakens, inviting both the serene and the adventurous to partake in its vibrant charm.",
