    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle shroud of clouds envelops the city, wrapping the nocturnal landscape in a muted stillness. The temperature rests comfortably at 57 degrees, with a subtle southwest wind whispering through the streets at about 8 mph, offering a hint of the freshness that lingers in the air. As dawn approaches, expect a transformation; the clouds will gradually give way to rays of warm sunshine, promising a high of 65 later in the day. With the winds picking up slightly, reaching 15 mph and gusting higher, there is a sense of excitement for the afternoon's bright reveal.\n\nLooking towards the coast, the delicate marine layer may linger in some areas, softening the horizon, yet should be retreating as the sun climbs. For those venturing out, layering is key\u2014perhaps a light sweater for the crisp morning air, transitioning to lighter attire as the sun warms the day. This is a perfect time for a stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9, where you can watch the city awaken and embrace its vibrant rhythm. Whether it's a quiet moment to enjoy the scenery or an invigorating walk with friends, today holds a gentle promise of pleasant experiences amid the gradual embrace of summertime warmth.",
