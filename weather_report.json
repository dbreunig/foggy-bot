    "weather_report": "As the early hours of dawn unfold over Downtown San Francisco, a soft blanket of clouds drapes the skyline, reflecting the lingering whisper of the past night. The air is cool, holding onto a temperature that hovers gently in the mid-fifties, accompanied by a playful breeze from the west-southwest, sending gentle ripples through the quiet streets. The promise of morning brings with it a slight chance of drizzle later in the afternoon, hinting at a day that balances between sunshine and fleeting showers.\n\nAs the sun rises, expect moments of clarity interspersed with the ever-present marine layer, particularly near the Golden Gate, where the fog dances lazily against the iconic structure. The temperature is expected to rise, inviting a high near sixty-three, while the winds freshen, stirring your hair with a touch of vitality. On a day like this, one might best adorn themselves in light layers, perhaps a breathable jacket to ward off the chill, paired with comfortable shoes suited for a stroll. Consider savoring the opportunity for a leisurely afternoon of exploring the quieter corners of the city, maybe venturing into a local caf\u00e9 to watch the world go by, or stepping onto a terrace to enjoy the shifting landscapes as the fog ebbs and flows. Today is a canvas of soft hues and potential, urging you to embrace its subtle charm.",
