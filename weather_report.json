    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco with a serene clarity, the sun gently casting a warm light across the skyline. Highs near 64 degrees beckon locals to step outside, as a light breeze rustles the leaves, hinting at the coolness that accompanies the Pacific\u2019s embrace. Though temperatures will soon retreat to a comfortable 61, one can enjoy the moment before clouds drift in, softening the vivid blue above.\n\nAs daylight wanes, clouds gather, portending a slight chance of rain well after nightfall, but for now, the atmosphere teems with possibility. With the promise of a 20% chance of light precipitation, evening excursions might require a light jacket, perhaps favoring layers to adjust as the temperature dips to around 53. In this pleasant interlude, consider venturing to one of the cozy caf\u00e9s nestled in quaint neighborhoods, or perhaps taking a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the glimmering bay dances with the last light of the day. The fog may not be a presence now, but as twilight descends, the marine layer could gently roll in, setting a tranquil mood over the city.",
