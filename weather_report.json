    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this Independence Day, the sun hangs bright in a cerulean sky, a refreshing departure from the usual fog that graces this city. With a gentle west wind sweeping through, you\u2019ll feel a coolness lingering, perfect for the active spirit. The temperature dances around the low sixties, teasing you with warmth that dissipates into the afternoon. As the sun heats the pavement and the city hums with life, the cool breeze invites you to enjoy outdoor pleasures like a stroll through the vibrant local parks or perhaps a seat at a bustling caf\u00e9, sipping chilled lemonade while observing the parade of life unfold.\n\nTonight, as the sun dips below the horizon and the chill deepens to a cozy embrace of low fifties, consider wrapping yourself in a light jacket. The west wind will still whisper through the evening, making post-dinner strolls along the waterfront a tranquil delight. The day offers a canvas of pleasant activity: a leisurely walk through the city\u2019s storied streets, partaking in spontaneous conversations with fellow wanderers, or simply basking in the glow of fireworks over the bay\u2014each moment stitched into the fabric of this unique city experience.",
