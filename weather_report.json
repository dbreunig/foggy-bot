    "weather_report": "As the night stretches on in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle mist of cloud envelops the city, cloaking the skyline in a soft embrace. The temperature flirts lazily around sixty degrees, making it a calming yet slightly cool evening. As the west wind whispers through the streets at a modest pace, the tendrils of fog weave their way into the nooks and crannies of the iconic architecture, casting a dreamlike veil over familiar landmarks. \n\nTomorrow promises a shift as morning gives way to partly sunny skies, revealing the potential for a high near sixty-seven. The west-southwest breeze may dance afresh, stirring up subtle gusts, reminding residents that although the sun typically bathes the city in warmth, the embrace of the maritime layer can linger, infusing the air with a refreshing crispness. For those stepping out, a light jacket or sweater will provide comfort as the day unfolds, balancing against the sun\u2019s anticipated emergence. It\u2019s a splendid opportunity to wander through local boutiques or savor a coffee at a quiet caf\u00e9, soaking in the unique charm of this vibrant city, where every corner turns an ordinary day into a canvas of delightful possibilities.",
