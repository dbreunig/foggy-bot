    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the skies wear a veil of clouds, promising a cool and breezy morning ahead. With temperatures lingering around a mild 57 degrees, the west-southwest winds whisper through the streets, carrying the faint scent of the sea as they dance between the buildings. The city is slowly rousing from its quiet slumber, hinting at a day that will meld the remnants of the ocean's embrace with the warmth of the sun later on.\n\nBy midday, the clouds are predicted to part, revealing patches of blue and painting the atmosphere with a gentle optimism. The high of 66 will encourage a shift towards a more pleasant warmth, perfect for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps enjoying a quiet moment in one of the many parks scattered throughout the city. It might be wise to layer your attire; a light jacket can shield against the brisk wind that will occasionally strut its stuff, gusting up to 28 mph, while allowing you to bask in the soft glow of the sun when it graces us with its presence. Such a day beckons exploration\u2014whether it be a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, a casual walk through the lively streets, or simply finding a sunny spot to sit and observe the colorful life of the city unfolding around you.",
