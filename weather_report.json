    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night casts a muted blanket over the city, a quiet prelude to the day that awaits. The temperature hovers gently around 59 degrees, accompanied by a whisper of a breeze from the south. As dawn approaches, the low clouds linger, reluctant to disperse entirely, adding a soft mystique to the skyline. However, with the sun poised to rise, promising daylight soon, one can sense the day's potential \u2014 a warm embrace anticipated with a high near 78 degrees.\n\nAs the morning unfolds into afternoon, the clouds will yield to stretches of blue, allowing sunlight to bathe the city in warmth. Dress comfortably in layers, reflecting the shifting moods of the atmosphere; a light jacket may be welcomed in the morning but will give way to t-shirts by noon. The city will breathe a sigh of relief as the fog recedes, leaving behind a crisp clarity that enhances the vibrant colors of the landscape. As you step outside, consider a leisurely stroll through the bustling streets or perhaps a calm visit to a local caf\u00e9 where the aroma of brewing coffee mingles with the day's new energy. Enjoy the spontaneous interactions with the world around you, allowing the engaging spirit of the city to carry you into a delightful day.",
