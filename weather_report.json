    "weather_report": "As the cool, damp breath of the Pacific washes over Downtown San Francisco, the morning ushers in a symphony of clouds, with rain likely to accompany the day. The temperature rests gently around 53 degrees, inviting a light jacket or a soft knit to shield against the chill. A quiet southwest wind stirs, weaving through the streets, hinting at the impending rain. Nearby, the fog hangs low like a whisper, tempering the skyline with a veil of mystery, while the iconic Golden Gate Bridge may emerge from the mist, only to retreat again into the soft embrace of the marine layer.\n\nThroughout the day, expect the gray skies to loom above, as chances of rain linger gently in the air. Temperatures will gradually cool, settling in the upper 50s by the afternoon, a gentle reminder of spring\u2019s playful temperament. For those venturing out, perhaps take a leisurely stroll through the labyrinthine streets or find refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the rhythm of the raindrops outside. Alternatively, an afternoon spent perusing the countless well-worn tomes at a local bookstore can be a lovely escape from the gloom. Embrace this weather as an invitation to savor the intimate corners of the city, where warmth and comfort await.",
