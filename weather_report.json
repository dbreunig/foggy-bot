    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco basks in the warmth of a mostly sunny sky, where the vibrant hues of blue merge with soft, drifting clouds. A gentle breeze whispers from the west, bringing a refreshing touch that dances across the city streets, perfect for those who wander about. As the day unfolds, expect the temperature to settle comfortably in the low seventies. There\u2019s an inviting clarity to the air, with the Golden Gate Bridge standing proud and unrestricted, bathed in sunlight.\n\nAs evening approaches, clouds will begin to weave a subtle tapestry across the skyline, dimming the day\u2019s brightness and ushering in a cooler ambiance that settles around fifty-seven degrees. While a slight chill may creep in, it remains far from overwhelming, making a light jacket or sweater a wise choice for those planning to linger outdoors as twilight descends. With the weather beckoning, consider a leisurely stroll through one of the city's scenic parks or perhaps a casual caf\u00e9 visit, where the inviting aromas of coffee and freshly baked pastries seamlessly blend into the pleasant atmosphere of an afternoon well spent.",
