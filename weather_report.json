    "weather_report": "This afternoon, Downtown San Francisco basks in a rare moment of sunlight, with the sky offering a clear canvas for the day. Temperatures hover around the comfortable mid-60s, providing a gentle warmth that invites you to shed layers but still consider a light jacket against the brisk west wind, which dances through the streets at a notable pace. As the sun begins its descent, the scenery transforms, the horizon giving way to a gentle twilight, punctuated by soft clouds that whisper of tonight's cooler embrace, likely settling around the low 50s.\n\nThe clarity of the day truly heightens the city's charms, as iconic landmarks sharpen against the backlight, albeit with whispers of fog forming at the edges. While the famed marine layer may lazily cling to the coast, hiding the Golden Gate Bridge at times, its allure remains \u2014 a promise of gentler breezes and cooler evenings. As dusk deepens, it is a perfect moment to wander the nearby streets, perhaps savoring a warm cup of coffee at a local cafe or leisurely walking along the Embarcadero while the city's lights twinkle to life. With the current conditions, it would be wise to choose layered attire, allowing you to adapt as daylight gives way to the night\u2019s embrace.",
