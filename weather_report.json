    "weather_report": "A gentle warmth graces Downtown San Francisco today, as the sun hangs high in a brilliant blue sky. With a high approaching seventy, the air is pleasantly mild, inviting folks to step out and enjoy the day. The westerly winds carry a refreshing whisper, stirring the leaves and creating a soft chorus beneath the golden sunshine. As the afternoon unfurls, temperatures will dip slightly, but the overall charm of the day remains intact, with a visibility so clear that one can almost feel a connection to the distant hills and sparkling waters.\n\nAs evening approaches, clarity will give way to a calm, moonlit night with the temperature settling around fifty-one. This is no ordinary twilight; it calls to mind the playful warmth of the sun, hinting at a perfect time for a stroll along the waterfront or lounging with a good book in one of the city\u2019s many parks. Dressed comfortably in layers \u2013 perhaps a light jacket for later \u2013 you'll find yourself at ease, embracing the allure of the golden hour. Whether you're wandering through the lively streets or savoring a quiet moment with a warm drink, today cradles the soul in delightful simplicity.",
