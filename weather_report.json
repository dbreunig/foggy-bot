    "weather_report": "As night shrouds Downtown San Francisco, a gentle breeze sweeps through the air, hinting at the coolness that accompanies the approaching twilight. While a slight chance of drizzle flirts with the possibility of dampness later on, for now, the skies remain mostly clear. Temperatures hover comfortably around sixty degrees, inviting a choice of light attire\u2014a cozy cardigan or a light jacket, perhaps. The west wind, playful by nature, whispers through the streets, stirring the most tranquil of evenings.\n\nTomorrow welcomes the dawn with a similar mix of lightness and warmth, as the sun's rays pierce through the residual morning haze, promising a sunny day with temperatures reaching near seventy-two. An undercurrent of coolness from the previous night still lingers, suggesting that a light layer might be prudent as you step out to greet the day. The chance of drizzle lingers in the morning air, but the afternoon will reveal a palette of brilliant blue skies, ideal for a stroll through the Mission District, savoring the vibrant murals and perhaps stopping for a sip of coffee at a favorite caf\u00e9 or exploring the charms of Golden Gate Park. Whether it's a leisurely walk or simply enjoying the city's rhythm, the pleasant weather invites quiet reflection amidst the buzz of everyday life.",
