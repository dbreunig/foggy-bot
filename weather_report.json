    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the sun graces the city with a gentle warmth, though a hint of coolness breezes in from the west. Anticipate temperatures reaching a high of 66 degrees, only to settle into a crisp 64 as the afternoon unfolds. The wind dances lightly, whipping up to 23 mph, occasionally punctuated by swift gusts that flirt with 29 mph, giving a bit of bite to the atmosphere. Beneath the radiant facade, clouds gather in the evening, hinting at a whisper of drizzle as the night approaches, with a low settling around 57.\n\nThe day appears inviting if not perfectly bright; patches of blue may peek through the scattered clouds, but the persistent marine layer lingers nearby, bearing a soft fog that cradles the city\u2019s iconic outlines. Such conditions call for layers\u2014a comfortable light jacket or a cozy sweater will suffice, shielding against the brisk breeze while allowing you to embrace the day\u2019s charm. A walk along the waterfront or through one of the city\u2019s historic parks seems a fitting choice, where the rhythmic sound of waves mingles with the essence of urban life, or perhaps a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 to appreciate a warm drink as twilight approaches.",
