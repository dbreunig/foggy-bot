    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the sky wears a blanket of clouds, hinting at the possibility of rain before the evening. A gentle, brisk breeze flows from the west-southwest, lending an invigorating chill to the air that tempers the day's warmth. The temperature hovers around a mild 63 degrees, inviting a moment of contemplation amidst the coolness. The 30% chance of rain casts a fleeting uncertainty, though one may venture forth under the clouds, as they seem to gather more for a quiet conversation than for an outright downpour. \n\nAs daylight wanes, the mercury is expected to ease into a comfortable 56 degrees, graced with a continued whisper of wind. While fog may not envelop the city in its usual embrace, expect the edges of the vast ocean to gather a gentle mist close by, subtly reminding you of the marine layer that dances just beyond the golden span of the bridge. For anyone planning ventures today, layered attire will serve you well; a light jacket over a long sleeve will keep you comfortably adorned against the cool. Consider a quiet stroll along the waterfront\u2014perhaps a slow amble to a cozy caf\u00e9 tucked away on a side street, where the sounds of conversation can mingle with the light percussion of rain against the windowpanes.",
