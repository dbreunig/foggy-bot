    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the sun spills over the city, casting a golden glow on the iconic skyline as a gentle breeze muscles its way through the streets. With temperatures resting comfortably around the mid-60s, the air feels pleasantly warm yet cool enough to remind you that the sea isn't too far off. The wind, teasingly playful at 13 miles an hour, adds an element of vitality, inviting you to leave your windows open and breathe in that unique blend of salt and city life. \n\nTonight, the skies will mellow into a soft, partly cloudy canvas, wrapping the day in a comforting embrace as temperatures dip to around 54 degrees. The whisper of the wind will continue, albeit softer, offering a lullaby of nature that might persuade you to take a stroll beneath the dimming sky. It\u2019s an ideal scenario for a light sweater or a casual jacket, enhanced by the camaraderie of an evening out\u2014perhaps an impromptu visit to a local caf\u00e9 to savor the richness of a warm drink, as the city\u2019s rhythm turns to a more relaxed pace. With a panorama free from the fog's usual grip, today beckons for a genuine exploration of the urban landscape; savor the sunlight while it graces the city, perhaps indulging in the understated charm of an afternoon park stroll or an outdoor art installation.",
