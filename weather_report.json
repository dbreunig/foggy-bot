    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the skyline stands beneath a blanket of mostly cloudy skies, cradling the city in muted hues. The gentle breeze, whispering from the west-southwest, stirs the air, softening the chill that brushes against the skin. The forecast hints at a modest low, inviting a light jacket or cozy sweater for those venturing out into the evening's embrace. Tomorrow promises a more uplifting scene, as the sun breaks through the clouds with intentions of warmth, nudging temperatures upward and coaxing outdoor activities into bloom. \n\nWhile the current atmosphere is laced with a hint of fog, its presence is subdued, lurking closer to the ocean's edge rather than enveloping the heights of the city. This evening's haze may cast an air of mystery, perfect for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or quiet moments over coffee at a corner caf\u00e9, while tomorrow's sunlight invites a brisk walk or a leisurely bike ride across Golden Gate Park. As the day unfolds, dressing in layers will allow for comfort amid the shifting temperatures, ensuring one can fully savor the unique charm that accompanies a San Francisco summer\u2019s day.",
