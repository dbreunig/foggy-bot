The overnight skies have been mostly clear, with a gentle west southwest breeze whispering at a casual pace. As daylight approaches, the remnants of any marine layer recede, leaving an unobscured view that hints at the vibrancy of the city beneath the soft blush of the dawning sun.\n\nBy mid-morning, expect the warmth of a sunny disposition to envelop the city. The high will reach a comfortable 74 degrees, tapering slightly to the low 70s as the afternoon meanders along. The blend of sun and the occasional playful breeze make it ideal for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the lively energy of the bustling market might just draw you in for a taste of local flavors. Dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a summery shirt to navigate the shifting temperatures\u2014 and consider making your way to one of the public parks. With the clear skies overhead, it\u2019s perfect for a simple picnic or a quiet moment of reflection as the city comes alive around you. As the day unfolds, it promises to be one that honors the gently warming embrace of late summer, urging you to savor each precious moment outdoors.",
