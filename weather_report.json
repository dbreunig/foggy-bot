    "weather_report": "As the sun prepares to rise over San Francisco, a soft veil of clouds hangs in the sky, casting a gentle shadow across the city. Currently, the air sits cool, a whisper of chill in the early morning, inviting a cozy layer before the day unfolds. With the fog hugging the coastline, the ethereal dance of marine layers graces the horizon, but the promise of clarity lingers as the sun's warmth begins to break through. Today, temperatures will reach a comfortable 61 degrees, and while the clouds may persist, they will yield to pockets of sunshine, creating a patchwork of shadows and light that softens the edges of this vibrant metropolis.\n\nThis tranquil morning offers a perfect excuse to embark on a leisurely stroll through one of the city's charming neighborhoods. A light jacket or sweater will suffice as you wander, perhaps finding a hidden caf\u00e9 to enjoy a moment of stillness with a warm cup in hand. The cooler breeze invites brief bursts of laughter among those sharing the city's path, while the sight of the Golden Gate Bridge peeking through the shifting clouds adds a backdrop of beauty that enchants every passerby. So, embrace the day with an open heart, for San Francisco's ethereal charm shines through, inviting exploration and simple joys that await around every corner.",
