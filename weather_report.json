    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle warmth under a welcoming sun. The skies are a clear blue canvas, providing a rare respite from the usual chill that can linger in the air. As temperatures hover close to 65 degrees, there\u2019s a promise of comfort, though later in the day, a slight drop to around 62 is anticipated. Winds whisper softly from the west-southwest, creating a subtle rustling in the trees, a reminder of the ocean\u2019s proximity. Evening approaches, bringing a mostly clear night with temperatures dipping into the low 50s\u2014a light jacket or a cozy sweater would be ideal for the coolness that follows as dusk settles over the city.\n\nWith these splendid conditions, the day invites exploration. Consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the water glimmers under the sun's embrace, or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee calls out. The vibrant atmosphere is perfect for engaging in conversation with friends or simply taking a moment to revel in the beauty of the city, all while feeling at ease in the gentle embrace of spring.",
