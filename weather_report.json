    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds with the gentle caress of sunshine, bathing the city in a warm, welcoming glow. As you look westward, the iconic contours of the Golden Gate Bridge rise against a backdrop of blue, with only wisps of white cloud blending into the horizon. The marine layer, a usual companion of San Francisco mornings, has retreated, leaving the skyline crisp and the air fresh, while the breeze drifts in from the southwest at a calm pace, inviting outdoor pursuits. By the afternoon, while temperatures drop slightly to a comfortable 65, there's a sense of ease\u2014perfect for a leisurely stroll through the parks or an unhurried caf\u00e9 visit, perhaps to savor a quiet moment with a book.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will transition to a soft tapestry of clouds, settling into a low of about 52, hinting at the cool embrace of night. In this splendid day, dressing in layers remains wise; a light jacket will serve well against the gentle chill that follows the sun's descent. Such a day calls for simple joys\u2014exploring local art galleries or indulging in a scene from a favorite neighborhood pub, where the warmth of community complements the fading sunlight. With its delightful clarity, today feels like a gift, inviting connection with both the city and its vibrant spirit.",
