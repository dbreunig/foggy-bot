    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle drizzle begins to fall, hinting at the soft embrace of the fog that often characterizes this city. At this hour, the skies are mostly cloudy, draping a muted gray over the familiar architecture, with temperatures hovering around a mild 55. The southwest wind carries a refreshing chill, whispering through the streets and gently rustling the leaves, offering a reminder of the bay's proximity. While the chance of significant precipitation remains low, the quiet drizzle adds a layer of intimacy to the night, perhaps encouraging a cozy retreat indoors with a book or a warm cup of tea.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the morning may still bear some traces of that drizzle, yet the clouds are expected to part and reveal a predominantly sunny day, albeit with a touch of coolness. As temperatures rise to a comfortable 65 before cooling slightly in the afternoon, the day beckons for a stroll through local caf\u00e9s or a leisurely walk along the waterfront. Layering is advisable, as the mornings can feel brisk while the midday sun offers a welcome warmth. Overall, the day looks to provide a serene backdrop for those who choose to explore the city, embracing both its fog and fleeting sunshine with equal grace.",
