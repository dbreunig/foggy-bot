    "weather_report": "As the sun slips beneath the horizon, Downtown San Francisco finds itself wrapped in the embrace of a gentle marine layer, a veil of mist that mingles with the cool evening air. The temperature drapes itself around you like a soft cashmere shawl at a balmy 53 degrees, while a serene west wind whispers through the streets, occasionally picking up strength in playful bursts that may ruffle your hair and lift your spirits. The city, cloaked in shades of deepening gray, speaks of a tranquil night ahead, where the hustle and bustle give way to the quiet murmur of the bay.\n\nLooking ahead to Memorial Day, a promising warmth awaits, as the sun is expected to take center stage, banishing clouds to celebrate another day. With a high near 62 degrees and a steadier breeze, the day will beckon outdoor adventures. Whether it\u2019s exploring the trails of Golden Gate Park, indulging in a quiet cup of coffee at a sun-drenched terrace, or simply wandering through the dynamic streets of the Mission District, there are many charms to be discovered. As you dress for the day, consider layers to navigate the morning chill, but plan to shed them as the sun invites the warmth of spring. A light jacket paired with comfortable shoes should serve you well, allowing you to fully embrace San Francisco's ever-changing beauty.",
