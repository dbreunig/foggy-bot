    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the skies are ablaze with an almost serene clarity, dominated by the gentle touch of the sun and softened by a few wispy clouds drifting lazily overhead. Despite the sun's warmth, a cool breeze plays through the streets, making the air feel fresh and alive, a reminder that winter has not fully released its grip on the region. As the day unfolds, temperatures will whisper downward, creating an inviting mood for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, where one may enjoy a moment of reflection accompanied by a warm drink.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the clouds will thicken, coaxing in a modest chance of rain later in the night. Though not a complete downpour, light showers could fall softly after the clock strikes four, refreshing the air and greening the landscape. With the temperature dipping into the cool range of the high forties, layering is advisable: a light sweater or jacket will provide comfort without overwhelming the senses. Given these conditions, an evening spent exploring the intimate corners of the city, or perhaps grabbing a bite at one of the local eateries, sounds just right. The energy of the city feels palpable, promising moments of warmth amidst the coming clouds.",
