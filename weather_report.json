    "weather_report": "As night gently embraces Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere carries a hint of moisture, signaling the arrival of patchy drizzle after 2 AM. The clouds gather like a soft blanket over the city, with a low temperature settling around a comfortable 55 degrees. A modest west-southwest wind whispers through the streets, moving gently at speeds of 5 to 10 mph. The chance of rain lingers at a mere 20%, suggesting that while some areas might experience light drizzles, the night will largely remain peaceful.\n\nAwakening on Monday brings the promise of a more uplifting horizon. Morning drizzle gives way to bursts of sunshine, transforming the sky into a palette of blue and white. As the day progresses, temperatures rise to around 65, descending to a cooler 62 in the afternoon. The west-southwest wind may kick up slightly, with gentle gusts stirring the air up to 18 mph. While not completely devoid of the marine layer, the city is set to bask in clearer conditions, with the chance of precipitation still holding at 20%. It\u2019s advisable to dress in layers; a light sweater will suffice for the cooler morning, but one might shed it as the sun graces the day. The weather invites a leisurely stroll through the park or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where one can relish a warm beverage while absorbing the gradual transition of nature from evening drizzle to vibrant daylight.",
