    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, one can expect a brief embrace of warmth amidst the typical coolness of the sea breeze. The skies, mostly sunny with a venerable brightness, invite you to linger outdoors, though the crisp air teeters gently on the edge of chill. Expect temperatures to taper off toward the mid-50s, drawing a subtle reminder of the ocean's influence, while the west-southwest wind whispers through the city at a mild pace. \n\nThis evening will usher in a curtain of clouds, as the sun gives way to a blanket of gray. With temperatures descending to the cozy mid-40s, a light jacket or sweater will become your trusted companion. The marine layer, faint and elusive, clings near the edges but won\u2019t impose; you may witness the playful dance of low clouds flirting with the hills, merely accentuating the city's dramatic silhouette. For those contemplating the hours ahead, consider a leisurely stroll through the Mission, with its vibrant murals catching the softening light, or perhaps settle into one of the quieter cafes that invite lingering over a warm cup, as the evening takes on its cool, contemplative air.",
