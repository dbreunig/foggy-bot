    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the atmosphere is cloaked in a drizzly veil, a reminder of the seasons shifting quietly around us. The rain dances from above, adding a gentle percussion to the rhythmic pulse of the city beneath, while wisps of clouds loom overhead like sheets of gray glass. Visibility is low, muted by a thick marine layer that wraps San Francisco\u2019s iconic skyline, pulling it closer to the earth, almost embracing it in a shroud of mystery. One can only imagine the Golden Gate Bridge disappearing in the haze, its grandeur softened into the fog's quiet embrace.\n\nAs the day wears on, expect this somber weather to persist, with sporadic showers preceding a partial clearing by nightfall. The winds from the west northwest promise to provide a brisk companion, urging you to dress warmly\u2014think layered sweaters beneath waterproof jackets, comfortable walking shoes that grip the pavement, and perhaps a scarf to fend off the chill. Should you venture outside, consider the simple pleasure of a quiet caf\u00e9, nestled beneath awnings, where you can sip a warm cup while the world drizzles around you. Or, if you seek solace, a stroll under your umbrella along the waterfront might offer a reflective moment amidst the soft patter of rain, as the city breathes in its own tranquil exhale.",
