    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this fine San Francisco morning, the city greets the day with an unblemished blue sky, warmed by a subtle sun that casts its golden glow over the landscape. As reported, the high today will hover near a cool 62 degrees but don't let that fool you into thinking it's chilly; it\u2019s quite brisk with a westerly breeze dancing through the streets at 15 to 25 miles per hour. Looking into the distance, hints of fog may linger\u2014those soft, gauzy whispers of marine layer occasionally slipping in from the bay, destined to retreat as the sun rises higher. \n\nTonight promises clarity too, though the air will cool, dipping down to a gentle 52 degrees. The winds may grow a tad more vigorous, gusting up to 35 mph, encouraging jackets or light layers as the day fades into evening. With this crisp weather, a stroll through one of the city\u2019s neighborhoods, perhaps a leisurely walk along the waterfront, could be delightful. One might even nestle into a quiet caf\u00e9, sipping a warm drink while the city hums with life, savoring both the warmth of community and the embrace of the San Francisco evening air.",
