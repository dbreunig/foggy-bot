    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a vibrant cerulean sky, marked by the warmth of the sun breaking through. Temperatures, gently retreating from the peak of the day, hover around a comfortable mid-60s, making for a day that feels refreshingly pleasant, accentuated by a light west-southwest breeze that whispers through the streets. The atmosphere is clear, with only traces of the usual marine layer lingering at the fringes, offering a hint of fog that dances beyond the Golden Gate Bridge but remains shy of the city\u2019s embrace.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds will begin to gather softly, providing a gentle transition into a partly cloudy night with temperatures dipping to a cozy 53 degrees. It would be wise to don a light sweater or jacket while enjoying a stroll along the waterfront or savoring a quiet moment in a nearby park. For those inclined to activity, the conditions beckon for a leisurely bike ride through the vibrant streets or a tranquil sit at a caf\u00e9, sipping a warm drink and watching the day wind down. Indeed, a late afternoon in San Francisco carries a promise of simple joys under a beautifully clear sky before the twilight embraces the city.",
