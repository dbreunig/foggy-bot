    "weather_report": "The sun casts a warm embrace over Downtown San Francisco today, marking the city with a gentle clarity. With the high hovering just around 74 degrees, one can feel the afternoon warmth filtering gently through the breezy West Southwest winds. A delightful hum of activity stirs in the streets as the sun's rays touch the historic facades, illuminating the golden tones of the day. While there's a whisper of coolness lingering in the air from the ocean's influence, the sky appears mostly clear, revealing a horizon uncluttered by fog, except for the distant silhouettes hinting at the marine layer\u2019s presence beyond the bridge.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect clouds to unfurl softly across the sky, bringing a quieter ambiance as night descends around 57 degrees. A light jacket may be prudent for those venturing out in the evening, especially with the brisk gusts that echo the sweet scent of saltwater. It is a fine time to indulge in a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the glittering lights dance along the bay\u2014perhaps even stopping for a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9, sipping a warm drink while the city hums softly around you.",
