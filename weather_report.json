    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a whisper of moisture, hinting at the patchy drizzle anticipated after the night unfolds. While the clouds hang mostly overhead, they lend an ethereal quality to an otherwise mild evening, with temperatures softly cradling the low fifties. The gentle west-southwest breeze, spurred on by intermittent gusts, adds a layer of crispness to the atmosphere, suggesting a tender embrace of layers might be needed if one ventures outdoors.\n\nThe day ahead promises to break free from the damp cloak as the morning unfolds into patches of sunshine, nudging the city\u2019s fa\u00e7ade into a gentle glow. With temperatures expected to rise toward the high sixties, falling perhaps to the mid-sixties as the afternoon stretches on, it invites a casual wardrobe\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a comfortable jacket perfect for layering, ensuring you\u2019re ready for the delightful interplay of warmth and coolness. As fog retreats, revealing the outlines of familiar landmarks against the skyline, this is a lovely opportunity for a stroll through the neighborhoods, a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the local parks, absorbing the city's enchanting vibrancy before it yields to the embrace of evening once more.",
