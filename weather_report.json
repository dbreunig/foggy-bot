    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the night yields to a gentle embrace of clarity, although remnants of the marine layer linger on the periphery. The skies above are primarily clear, allowing the soft glow of early morning light to infuse the atmosphere with a refreshing vitality. With the temperature resting comfortably at around 52 degrees, a slight west-southwest breeze sweeps through, whispering promises of the sunny day ahead.\n\nBy midday, the sun will warm the city, with a forecasted high near a pleasant 64 degrees, gradually settling to a cooler 62 as afternoon rolls in. The wind will dance briskly at 10 to 20 mph, providing an invigorating chill that may send you reaching for a light jacket or sweater. The day appears inviting, with little indication of fog obstructing your view of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge; rather, it seems a delightful opportunity awaits for those inclined to stroll along the waterfront or explore one of the city's myriad parks. Venturing out for coffee at a charming caf\u00e9, or perhaps a leisurely visit to the Farmers' Market can be wonderfully enriching activities. Dress in layers to embrace the shifting temperatures and enjoy this picturesque day in the heart of San Francisco.",
