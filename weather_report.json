    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the weather unfolds under a mostly sunny sky, offering a pleasant escape from the urban hustle. Temperatures hover around a comfortable 68 degrees, gradually slipping to 66, paired with a gentle west-southwest breeze that adds a refreshing touch, whispering promises of warmth interspersed with occasional gusts. The clarity is remarkable\u2014there\u2019s a vividness to the skyline, a crisp definition against the cerulean backdrop, though the marine layer lingers just beyond the hills, hinting that it may make a subtle return as daylight wanes.\n\nAs night draws closer, the skies will begin to shroud themselves in clouds, dipping into a cooler realm with temperatures settling at about 57 degrees. This gradual transformation calls for a jacket or a light sweater, suitable for an evening stroll or a relaxed gathering at one of the city\u2019s inviting parks, perhaps savoring the sounds of the gentle bay while wrapped in the embrace of twilight. A perfect time to engage with the evening\u2019s mellow rhythm, whether it's enjoying a quiet moment by the waterfront or exploring the diverse culinary offerings that thrive in this vibrant neighborhood.",
