    "weather_report": "As the night gently yields to the early hours of Sunday, Downtown San Francisco's skyline is embraced by a blanket of clouds, indicative of the marine layer that frequently kisses the area this time of year. The low, hovering around a crisp 54 degrees, carries with it a steady wind from the west southwest, rustling the trees and hinting at the day\u2019s incoming breeze. Yet the fog seems to linger close to the coastline, likely obscuring the Golden Gate Bridge and creating that quintessential atmospheric drama that defines this city. \n\nAs the sun arcs higher, expect a shift towards partly sunny skies, warming the air to a temperate 62 degrees by midday. The winds will pick up, gusting up to 26 mph, invigorating the sea air and reminding us of the ever-changing nature of this urban landscape. Given the conditions, layered clothing will be your ally\u2014think a light sweater topped with a windbreaker, perfect for those moments when the chill of the bay whispers through the streets. The day calls for quiet pleasures: perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the water glistens beneath the shy sun, or a leisurely coffee break at a local caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating, ideal for people-watching. While the marine layer may obscure the boundaries of sky and sea, it only adds to the quiet charm of a San Francisco Sunday, inviting you to embrace the rhythm of the day around you.",
