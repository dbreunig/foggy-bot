    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the air carries the promise of a quiet, muted beauty, though a hint of rain lingers in the atmosphere, vanishing as the late morning sun attempts to break through scattered clouds. The high temperature will hover around a cool 58 degrees, with a gentle breeze from the west-southwest whispering through the streets, barely disturbing the tranquility. A mere 20% chance of precipitation means you can venture out without a significant worry about needing an umbrella, but do keep an eye on the darkening clouds that can shift without warning.\n\nAs night approaches, expect the sky to clear, ushering in a crisp evening with temperatures dipping to around 46 degrees. The air, while fresh, carries the slightly damp scent of the city, remnants of the morning's rain. Dressing in layers is advisable; a light jacket would provide comfort against the evening chill, while perhaps a cozy scarf could add an element of warmth as you stroll through the increasingly quiet streets. The waning day beckons you to explore the local cafes or perhaps take a gentle walk along the Embarcadero, enjoying the soft ebb and flow of city life while the world moves gracefully into night.",
