    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of tranquility blankets the city, the cool air subtly infused with the lingering whispers of twilight. While the forecast hints at a low of around 48 degrees, tonight's sky showcases a patchwork of clouds, casting a gentle, muted glow as the last light of day fades into the horizon. A light breeze rustles through the streets, inviting the faintest chill, making it an ideal evening for a cozy gathering indoors or perhaps a contemplative stroll beneath the stars.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the promise of mostly sunny skies emerges, encouraging a soft awakening with temperatures peaking near 64 degrees as the day unfolds. It's the perfect time to embrace the outdoors, whether taking a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or savoring a quiet moment in one of the local parks. Layers will be your best ally, a light sweater or jacket serving you well for the morning's crispness before the sun\u2019s warmth envelops you later in the day. Keep an eye out for any encroaching fog from the bay, as the marine layer may dance along the waterfront, adding a touch of mystery to the landscape. The day offers an invitation to savor the simple joys of life, perhaps at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, where one can sip coffee while the world awakens around them.",
