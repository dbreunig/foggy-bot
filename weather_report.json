    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a pleasant warmth envelops the city, under a canopy of brilliant sunshine. The temperatures hover just above 60 degrees, with a gentle west-southwest breeze rustling through the streets. The skies are remarkably clear today, offering unobstructed views of the iconic skyline and a striking horizon. While the familiar marine layer often drapes the surroundings, it seems to have retreated, allowing the golden hues of the sun to paint the landscape in warm, inviting tones.\n\nTonight, as dusk settles, the clarity may soften slightly, but the overall forecast promises a comfortable and mostly clear night with temperatures dipping into the low fifties. This evening, a light jacket would be wise, especially with the cool breeze rolling in from the west. With such enticing conditions, consider wandering along the Embarcadero or enjoying a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many parks, where the golden hour casts a gentle glow over the blooming flora, offering an ideal setting for reflection or casual conversation.",
