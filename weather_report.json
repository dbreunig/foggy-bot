    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the sky presents a gentle panorama of partly sunny hues, with a soft embrace of cool air that invites one outdoors. With temperatures hovering around a mild 58 degrees, the warmth of the sun gently breaks through the morning cloud cover, though it is destined to cool a bit in the afternoon, settling around 56. A light breeze, meandering its way through the streets at 3 to 10 mph, adds a refreshing touch to the atmosphere, hinting that a layer of comfort will be essential for an afternoon of exploration.\n\nHowever, the charm of this day is soon to shift as the evening anticipates a much-needed rainfall, arriving after 11 pm. Thus, as the sun begins to dip and the clouds thicken, the forecast suggests dressing in layers\u2014think a cozy sweater or light jacket complemented by a scarf for those sensitive to the evening chill. It is an ideal moment to wander into a quaint caf\u00e9 or perhaps immerse oneself in a gripping novel at a nearby library as the rain quietly begins to serenade the city. As you savor this peaceful interlude, it\u2019s wisest to keep an umbrella close at hand, ready for the evening's embrace of moisture, and let the rhythms of the day settle into the tranquil cadence of the night.",
