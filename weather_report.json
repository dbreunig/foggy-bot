    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the air is laced with a palpable chill that hints at rain. The forecast suggests a 50% chance of precipitation before 11 PM, and although the darkening skies appear partly cloudy, a distinct possibility of light rainfall lingers. With temperatures dipping to around 46 degrees, a light jacket or sweater is advisable should you venture out. The west wind whispers softly, adding a crispness that is both refreshing and invigorating.\n\nAs we turn toward Thursday, the promise of clearer skies offers a reassuring embrace. A beautiful day awaits, bathed in mostly sunny light, with temperatures expected to rise to roughly 59 degrees. Whether strolling along the waterfront or sipping a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9, the conditions will certainly improve. With the marine layer just retreating, the visibility should be fair, inviting an exploration of the rich landscapes and urban murals of the city. Given the cool start to the night, cozy layers will keep you comfortable while you enjoy a gentle dawn or indulge in quiet moments of reflection before the busier hours of the day unfold.",
