    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night carries a gentle mix of uncertainty and coolness, blending the remnants of rainfall with the stirring whispers of wind. Right now, it seems the city is enveloped in clouds, promising a chance of rain that lingers like an uninvited guest. The air, crisp and calm, holds a low temperature, urging one to wrap up in layers that provide both warmth and comfort. While a noticeable breeze dances through the shadows of the buildings, the mood remains contemplative, perfect for quiet reflection or a stroll through the hushed streets.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the city will transition into a partly sunny canvas, yet the chill will persist, with temperatures hovering around the mid-fifties before gracefully falling back in the afternoon. The likelihood of rain persists, hinting at the potential for a light shower, but true fog, often the city's captivating shroud, appears to be at bay this morning. With a brisk wind rustling through the avenues, perhaps a coffee in hand while exploring lesser-known nooks and crannies would be a fitting way to engage with the city's vibrant heart. One may also find joy in visiting cozy bookshops or enjoying a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9, savoring the flavors while the day unfolds softly ahead.",
