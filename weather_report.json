    "weather_report": "As the city slowly awakens from its nighttime slumber, a hush blankets Downtown San Francisco, the air tinged with the cool freshness of approaching dawn. Patchy fog swirls after 4 a.m., cloaking the skyline in a delicate veil, while the low temperature hovers around a soft 50 degrees. Those early risers stepping outside are met with the gentle caress of a south-southwest breeze, stirring a hint of vibrancy in the quiet morning.\n\nAs the sun ascends into the cobalt sky, expect a gradual transition from this muted mystique to a day bursting with sunshine. Fog will linger just a bit longer before retreating before 7 a.m., allowing warmth to spread across the city, peaking at a comfortable 68 degrees later in the afternoon. With the winds whispering through the streets at 2 to 10 mph, today beckons for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a relaxed visit to one of the local cafes. A light jacket should accompany your morning coffee run, ideal for the remnants of fog, though as the sun embraces the day, a light layer would suffice to transition into the warmth. It\u2019s a splendid day to explore some hidden gems in the city, take a contemplative walk through Golden Gate Park, or simply relish the serenity of a sunlit afternoon with a book in hand amid lively company.",
