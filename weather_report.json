    "weather_report": "As the sun begins its descent behind the familiar silhouettes of San Francisco, the evening air carries a hint of chill, a reminder of the city's coastal embrace. Currently, the skies are partly cloudy, with a soft breeze rustling the treetops and reminding passersby of the West Southwest winds that are beginning to pick up. The low tonight hovers around 50 degrees, a gentle invitation for light layers, perhaps a cozy sweater over a tee, ideal for those leisurely strolls along the waterfront or simply enjoying a warm drink on a terrace that offers a view of the shimmering Bay.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the morning promises a brighter farewell to the weekend, as the clouds will give way to ample sunshine, creating the perfect backdrop to explore the neighborhoods and hidden gems of the city. A high near 60 degrees beckons adventurers outdoors, with the breeze maintaining its playful touch. The coastal mist remains a constant companion, laying gently west of the Golden Gate, though it should lift as the day progresses, offering glorious clarity to all who venture out. \n\nFor those keen on soaking in the local atmosphere, a visit to one of the myriad cafes on a sunlit sidewalk could offer a serene moment, while a stroll through the vibrant streets of the Mission or an afternoon at a local park would celebrate the pleasant weather. Dress comfortably, yet smartly; a light jacket or shawl will help shield against the evening chill, ensuring you remain comfortable while you enjoy the enchanting beauty of San Francisco as dusk settles over the bay.",
