    "weather_report": "As night descends over Downtown San Francisco, the city wears its serenity like a soft blanket, the skies mostly clear and a gentle breeze weaving through the streets. The temperature, comfortably resting around 58 degrees, invites an easy evening outdoor stroll, especially along the waterfront where the lights of the city flicker like stars fallen to earth. The west-southwest wind, whispering at about 12 miles per hour, carries a cool touch, perhaps hinting at the crispness that tomorrow's dawn shall bring.\n\nAs the hours roll into Tuesday, the horizon promises a canvas painted in bright sunshine, ushering in a warm high near 69 degrees. While the warmth will mingle with the afternoon chill, making for a caressing embrace of cool breezes, the marine layer may linger subtly, caressing the coastlines. Those venturing outside might find comfort in layers: a light sweater or jacket for the morning chill, transitioning to lighter fabrics as the day unfolds. An abundant blue sky beckons for leisurely pursuits; a caf\u00e9 visit followed by an exploration of the parks or the bustling Farmer\u2019s Market could enrich the day's experience, as the city reveals its charm, bathed in golden sunlight.",
