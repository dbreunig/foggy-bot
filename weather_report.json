    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a distinct crispness, tracing its lineage from the rolling coastal winds. Currently, a partly cloudy sky shrouds the horizon, with a low hovering gently around 53 degrees. The brisk west-southwest breeze whistles through the streets, occasionally stirring up a flurry of leaves. The city pulses with its usual rhythm, though the winds, reaching up to 24 mph, cast a lively touch on the evening\u2019s ambiance.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the forecast hints at a day saturated in sunshine, a commodity cherished amid the varied moods of San Francisco weather. The high temperature, nudging close to 66 degrees and easing into a cooler afternoon, invites a leisurely pace. For those contemplating plans, layering becomes paramount; a light jacket over a comfortable shirt will carry you gracefully through the warmth of midday and into the chillier embrace of evening. Perhaps a wandering stroll along the waterfront or a coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9 would best suit the day, allowing one to bask in the transition from the vibrant canvas above to the bustling life below.",
