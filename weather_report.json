    "weather_report": "The afternoon skies over Downtown San Francisco are gradually shedding the remnants of the morning's drizzle, transforming into a canvas of gentle warmth and light. As the sun ascends higher, its golden rays illuminate the skyline, casting long shadows across the streets while softening the briskness of the south-southwest breeze. The high, clear blue above is punctuated by only the faintest whispers of fog lingering in the distance, giving a hint of the famous marine layer without imposing on the day\u2019s evolving beauty. \n\nWith temperatures poised near 78 degrees but feeling slightly cooler as the day rolls on, it\u2019s wise to dress in layers: perhaps a light shirt accompanied by a cardigan or a casual jacket to accommodate the shifting temperatures. As you stroll through the city or take a leisurely walk along the waterfront, consider immersing yourself in the local rhythm\u2014perhaps by visiting a cozy caf\u00e9 with a window seat or catching an outdoor art installation. It's an ideal moment to absorb the city's vibrant spirit, where the blend of sun and slightly crisp air invites both reflection and exploration.",
