    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night wraps around the city like a soft blanket, devoid of clouds, with a few stars twinkling faintly overhead. The air, crisp and refreshing, feels almost soothing against your skin, dipping to a comfortable chill that hints at the dawn ahead. As morning approaches, the promise of a sunny day unfolds, with the sun poised to rise and wash the landscape in golden warmth. The forecast hints at temperatures reaching a pleasant peak around 68 degrees, a perfect invitation to embrace the outdoors.\n\nAs the city wakes up, you may notice wisps of marine layer momentarily caressing the Golden Gate, teasing but not fully obscuring the view. However, this fog will retreat as the sun makes its graceful ascent, leaving clear skies ideal for wandering through the city\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods or enjoying breakfast at a local caf\u00e9 tucked away in an alley. Light layers are advisable\u2014perhaps a light sweater to ward off the morning chill, accompanied by comfortable shoes as you stroll the ever-inviting streets. The day beckons for leisurely activities; consider a visit to the bay, where you can enjoy the beauty of the water reflecting the sun's rays, or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the charming parks, where the gentle sound of leaves and distant laughter creates an atmosphere of tranquility.",
