    "weather_report": "Tonight, San Francisco is enveloped in a gentle embrace of rain, the kind that softly taps at windowpanes and sends a soothing hum through the evening air. The relentless clouds cast a melancholic grayness, a perfect backdrop for the New Year\u2019s ceremony to pass in quiet reflection. Expect the chill to settle in as temperatures skulk down to around 50, gradually rising to a mild 52 by morning, carried on an easterly breeze that whispers secrets of the Bay. With a 90% chance of precipitation, the streets will glisten under the streetlights, inviting contemplative strolls amidst the urban glow.\n\nAs dawn breaks on New Year's Day, the rain lingers, hanging in the air like unspoken resolutions. The day will transition from the damp chill of morning to an afternoon where the air warms slightly, though a subdued temperature around 56 will still reign. Gusts from the south will create a brisk atmosphere, casting a rhythmic rhythm to the day. The pervasive cloud cover suggests a veiling marine layer; the fog's familiar embrace isn\u2019t far off, shrouding the city in a dreamy, mystical quality. Dressed in layers\u2014perhaps a sturdy raincoat paired with a cozy sweater or a soft scarf\u2014residents and visitors might find solace in a quiet caf\u00e9, warmed by a cup of tea or coffee, or wander through boutique shops that welcome the gentle jaunt of an offbeat holiday. Embrace the day\u2019s moody charm and let San Francisco\u2019s spirit envelop you, even through the rain.",
