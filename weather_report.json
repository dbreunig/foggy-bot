    "weather_report": "As the night settles softly over Downtown San Francisco, an ensemble of stars punctuates the dark sky, casting a gentle glow over the city's outline. The air carries a crispness, typical of summer evenings in this marine haven. Notably absent is the familiar fog that often wraps itself around the Golden Gate, leaving the skyline clear and inviting under the moonlight. With the temperature hovering around the pleasant low fifties, the breeze dances through the streets, whispering tales of distant waves and cool seaside air, carried forth by winds from the west.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, expect a sun-drenched Independence Day. Although the daytime high will hover near a cool sixty-two degrees, the sun promises a brilliance, albeit with a cool edge. For those venturing out, layers are your ally; a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the gusts that may flirt with the high twenties, especially as the shadows lengthen in the afternoon. If one were to traverse the city\u2019s hilly landscape, perhaps take pleasure in a stroll through Golden Gate Park or enjoy a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9, feeling the pulse of the city on this festive day. The quiet charm of urban life, with the sun illuminating its details, paints a perfect backdrop for enjoyment\u2014one where the mundane transforms into something special amidst the natural beauty of this iconic destination.",
