    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Downtown San Francisco, the city is cloaked in a veil of patchy fog, lending an ethereal quality to the waking world. The air is crisp and cool, lingering around fifty degrees with a gentle west southwest breeze whispering through the streets. As you step outside, a light layer of moisture clings to the atmosphere, and the softness of the fog mingles with the promise of a partly sunny day ahead. As the morning unfolds, expect a delicate transformation, with a potential sprinkle of rain surfacing in the late hours. \n\nThe weather is balanced\u2014refreshing yet slightly oppressive in its humidity. Layers will be your best companion; a light jacket over a sweater would protect against the chill while remaining comfortable as the temperature nudges slightly upward, peaking near fifty-eight. Perhaps consider a stroll through the less frequented corners of the city, where the fog plays hide-and-seek with landmarks and flavor spills from cozy coffee shops. Venture into a boutique or lose yourself in a bookstore, finding solace in the pages until the sun breaks through and illuminates the streets once more.",
