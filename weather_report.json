Tonight, temperatures are expected to dip to a cool 50 degrees, inviting light layers\u2014a well-worn cardigan or a soft scarf might just be the perfect companions for an evening promenade. The whisper of the west-southwest wind lingers softly, rustling leaves and carrying the faint sound of distant waves, as the city gradually yields to the calm of the night.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the sun prepares for a brighter display, promising clear blue skies that will warm the day to a high near 64, a delightful reprieve as further warmth will settle in the afternoon. For those contemplating how to occupy their hours, consider wandering through the verdant parks, soaking up the sunshine with a good book or a leisurely coffee. It may be pleasant to explore the bustling local shops or simply to enjoy a moment of pause at one of the city's many lookouts, where one can delight in the lively vistas beyond. As the fog rolls gently away from the coast, the clarity of the day seems to beckon, inviting all to partake in the simple joys that a fine San Francisco day can offer.",
