    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under the soft embrace of a bright sun and clear skies. A refreshing northwest breeze whispers through the city streets, bringing with it a hint of crispness that punctuates the air. With temperatures hovering pleasantly in the mid-50s, one might feel compelled to step outside, perhaps savoring a coffee at their favorite caf\u00e9 as they watch the world drift by. The Bay glitters under the sunlight, while the Golden Gate Bridge stands resolute in the distance, its iconic towers lovingly framed by a cloudless blue.\n\nAs the evening approaches and the sun dips behind the horizon, the warmth will give way to a cooler night, inviting layers for those venturing out. The prevailing clarity of the day suggests a rare break from the fog that often cloaks the city\u2019s landmarks. While tonight promises to be mostly clear, the air may turn brisk; a light jacket or wrap will be a wise companion for an evening stroll along the Embarcadero. Such an excursion, paired with the glowing lights of the city reflecting off the water, offers a calming end to a beautiful day.",
