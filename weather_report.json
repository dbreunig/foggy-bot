    "weather_report": "As the sun begins to embrace the charm of Downtown San Francisco, the remnants of a morning drizzle fade away, leaving behind a palette of soft azure skies. The day unfolds with a refreshing breeze that dances through the streets, rustling the leaves and encouraging pedestrians to step outside. The high expected to hover around a temperate 68 degrees encourages light layers; perhaps a light sweater to combat the cooling shadows from iconic buildings, particularly as the afternoon drifts toward a mild 66.\n\nAlthough the fog may be lingering near the shoreline, its grip on the city is momentarily loosened, suggesting a delightful clarity for the adventurous. The coastline beckons with the promise of stunning vistas, while the Bay Bridge remains a luminous beacon against the backdrop of this inviting day. It's an excellent moment to take a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps settle into a cozy caf\u00e9 with a good book, savoring the gentle warmth as evening approaches. As the sun dips, the temperature will lower pleasantly, inviting the kind of evening attire that might include a light jacket for a walk beneath the stars.",
