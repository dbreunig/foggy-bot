    "weather_report": "As darkness still clings to the edges of Downtown San Francisco, a gentle mist hangs in the air, echoing the forecasted chance of rain that will gracefully drift away by dawn. The city, draped in a soft veil of clouds, beckons with the allure of a quiet morning\u2014one that promises just a hint of sunshine to emerge later. With a low temp hovering around that comforting 50 degrees, the atmosphere feels balanced, as if the air is holding its breath, waiting for the sun's warming embrace. \n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the cool, crisp air to lift, revealing glimpses of blue amid the shifting clouds. The high may settle around 58, allowing for the pleasant sensation of warmth against the skin while still maintaining a need for a light jacket. Dress in layers, perhaps opting for a cozy sweater paired with comfortable trousers to navigate the day. For those seeking an outdoor escape, consider a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park, where the fresh air mingles with the tantalizing scent of spring blooms. Alternatively, a quiet corner in a caf\u00e9, sipping a warm drink and watching the world softly awaken, offers a perfect way to bask in the tranquil mood of the morning.",
