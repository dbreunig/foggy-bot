    "weather_report": "The early hours in Downtown San Francisco bring a muted dance of clouds across the sky, wrapping the city in a gentle shroud. With the temperature hovering around a mild 57 degrees, a brisk west-southwest wind whisks through the streets, whispering tales of change as it rustles through the trees. As dawn approaches, one can sense that the veil of clouds will dissipate into a brilliant canvas, promising mostly sunny skies come afternoon. The warmth is expected to rise gently to about 70 degrees, a perfect invitation for a stroll along the Embarcadero or a coffee on a sun-washed patio.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the marine layer will likely retreat, allowing the iconic contours of the Golden Gate and the skyline to emerge in all their glory. This is not a day for heavy coats; instead, consider a light sweater or a layered shirt to navigate the shifting coolness of the morning air and the eventual embrace of warmth. It\u2019s the kind of day that beckons quiet exploration: perhaps a leisurely visit to the Ferry Building Marketplace for fresh pastries or a quiet moment in one of the sprawling parks, where the city buzz feels a little more distant, if only for a heart's pause.",
