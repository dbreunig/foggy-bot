    "weather_report": "The weather in Downtown San Francisco paints a picture of a day transitioning through vibrant sun and soft clouds, a typical dance of the city's atmospheric charm. This afternoon heralds warmth, with the temperature reaching a comfortable 66 degrees before descending to a refreshing 62. The gentle, swirling winds from the west-southwest\u2014blowing robustly at 24 mph\u2014add a crispness to the air that one feels as they stroll through the streets. The expansive sky above, radiant with sunshine, may hold just a few clouds that drift lazily by, serving as gentle reminders that evening will soon arrive, bringing with it a cooler temperament.\n\nAs the evening sets in, temperatures will slide down to around 54 degrees, wrapping the city in a cozy embrace. Those venturing out might find that a light jacket or layer is their best ally, a casual defense against the chill. While fog has seemingly retreated today, embracing the golden hues instead, the city\u2019s notorious marine layer is never far. Evening walks along the waterfront, perhaps through the quaint byways of North Beach or along the Embarcadero, present themselves as splendid choices. These streets seem to glow under the fading light, inviting those seeking a tranquil respite from the day's bustle to take a leisurely pace, enjoy a warm drink, and relish in the joy of simple pleasures.",
