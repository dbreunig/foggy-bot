    "weather_report": "Today\u2019s weather in Downtown San Francisco remains shrouded in a layer of cloudiness, revealing a city cloaked in an atmosphere of poignant anticipation. The rain will sweep in before sunset\u2014likely bringing a chill, particularly as the temperatures hover around a mild but damp low of 52 degrees this evening. Conditions reflect a lingering gloom, yet with that peculiarly rugged charm that San Francisco wears as a badge. The gusty winds from the south southwest, swelling up to 36 mph, lend a brisk edge to the air, hinting at a shift, a whisper of the Pacific infused with moisture, clashing subtly with the urban landscape.\n\nAs the day unfolds, those wandering through the streets should consider layering their attire; a lightweight waterproof jacket paired with a comfortable sweater would be wise. Footwear that can withstand sudden splashes is also advisable, as puddles could surprise even the most diligent of commuters. There\u2019s a lovely romance in the rain, a chance to embrace the city\u2019s spirit through a compact caf\u00e9 visit, where a warm cup of coffee could serve as both balm and comfort. So, take the opportunity to explore the depths of your favorite book shop, or stroll through the winding streets of the Mission, while the clouds gather and the promise of rain unfolds into the evening.",
