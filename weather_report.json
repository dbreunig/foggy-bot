    "weather_report": "As dusk approaches Downtown San Francisco, the sky hangs heavy with clouds, casting a muted pallor over the iconic skyline. The forecast hints at temperatures dipping to a mellow 50 degrees, accompanied by gentle breezes whispering from the west. The evening air feels cool, a reminder of the marine layer that often cloaks the city in a soft, foggy embrace. \n\nTomorrow promises a turn toward brightness, with conditions shifting to mostly sunny. The daytime hours may usher in a comfortable warmth, reaching around 65 degrees. The tips of the Golden Gate Bridge may flirt with clearer skies, but for now, the fog serves as a blanket, likely keeping the chill close. As you contemplate your evening plans, layering is wise; a light jacket or sweater will suit the briskness, inviting you to stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps allow for a quiet sit at a cozy caf\u00e9, sipping something warm and reflecting on the understated beauty of the city cloaked in gray. Tomorrow could beckon you outdoors, a perfect day for a leisurely bike ride through the Presidio or a casual walk along the waterfront, where the sun will dip through the clouds, illuminating the vibrant streets.",
