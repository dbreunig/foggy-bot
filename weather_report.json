    "weather_report": "As the night drapes over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle embrace of mostly cloudy skies lingers, underlined by a moderate breeze from the west southwest at 12 mph. The temperature, a comfortable 54 degrees, hints at an evening of reflection, where the warmth of a soft blanket might be as inviting as a good book. Yet, dawn brings promises of change; Friday boasts a transformation into mostly sunny skies, where the sun's golden hues will peek through by late morning, nudging temperatures to a delightful 66 before gracefully dipping back to 64 as the afternoon unfurls.\n\nThe picture painted by the day's shift suggests a brightened outlook, with wisps of fog likely lingering closer to the coast, just nudging at the city\u2019s edges. Those venturing out should wear layers, perhaps a light sweater or a windbreaker to counter the briskness of that afternoon breeze, while still enjoying the warmth of the sun\u2019s rays. As the morning unfolds, a stroll through a quiet park, a visit to a favorite caf\u00e9, or even a leisurely bike ride along the waterfront would be perfect ways to savor the crispness of the day, all to the backdrop of a vibrant and inviting city.",
