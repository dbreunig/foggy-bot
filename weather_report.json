    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens in Downtown San Francisco, the evening brings with it a crispness that whispers of the impending night. The skies are mostly clear, adorned only with the faintest brush of lingering twilight hues. A gentle west-southwest wind weaves through the streets, rustling the leaves as it plays a soft serenade, with gusts occasionally rising to remind us of its presence. The temperature rests comfortably, cradling a coolness that feels refreshing against the skin, ideal for a relaxed evening meander.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the sun will rise with generous warmth, promising a glorious day bathed in golden light. The forecast hints at a high near 66, charmingly mild, while a continuous, moderate breeze will keep the air invigorating. As you step out, consider layering\u2014as the morning reveals its brilliance, a light jacket or sweater will allow for comfort until the sun's embrace fully claims the day. This inviting weather beckons one to stroll through the neighborhoods, perhaps indulging in a late afternoon visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 or simply wandering along the waterfront to take in the serene views, a delightful treat before the chaos of the week.",
