    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds with a gentle, partly sunny disposition. The gray clouds loom slightly above, allowing glimpses of warmth to filter through, though the high of 60 feels more like the teasing hand of spring rather than a bold embrace. With temperatures bordering on a cool 57 by afternoon, the scene remains illuminated by a light west-northwest breeze whispering through the streets, stirring the crispness that San Francisco is known for. \n\nAs twilight approaches, the clouds gather in anticipation of rain, which may begin as the clock strikes early morning. A hint of moisture appears imminent, with a low tonight settling around 49 yet creeping slightly upward as the night deepens. This ebb and flow of temperatures feels like a heartbeat, a steady rhythm in urban life. For those mindfully navigating their attire, layers remain the choice of the day\u2014perhaps a light sweater with a jacket close at hand is wise, especially if one plans to wander through the quieter neighborhoods or tuck into a cozy caf\u00e9 later. This evening suggests the perfect backdrop for an intimate gathering in a warm nook, where good conversation can flourish, with the horizon\u2014a tapestry of shadows hinting at the rain to come\u2014filling the city with anticipation.",
