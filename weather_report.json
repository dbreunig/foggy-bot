    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco presents a gentle tableau, under the soft embrace of a partly cloudy sky. The temperatures linger close to the coolness of 46 degrees, with a flaky northeast breeze whispering between buildings at a leisurely pace. This creates a setting that feels both crisp and invigorating, beckoning the early risers to wrap themselves in layers that blend warmth and comfort\u2014a light jacket would serve well against the cooler air, offering a shield against the dim chill of the remaining night.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the sun breaks forth, guiding the temperatures towards a high near 58. Yet, it will play coy, dipping to about 55 by the afternoon. The city skyline, while vibrant under the sun's nurturing glow, may still carry the aftertaste of the marine layer, which, if it lingers just off the coast, could wrap key landmarks in a veil of gentle mist or fog. However, overall visibility remains promising, allowing for unobstructed views that invite strolls along the waterfront. With a day like this extending gently into evening, one could relish a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9\u2014perhaps indulging in a warm beverage while gazing at the bustling life of the city, or taking a leisurely walk through the nearby parks to savor the crisp seasonal air.",
