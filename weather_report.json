    "weather_report": "As we glide into the later hours of this afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, a comforting calm settles over the city. The sun peeks through the gentle white clouds, embracing temperatures that hover around 63 degrees. A playful west wind dances through the streets at about 16 mph, stirring the leaves and lending a crispness to the air that is invigorating yet soothing. It's a moment where the city shows itself with a certain clarity, though the presence of fog, a staple of this coastal haven, lingers nearby, ready to weave in as dusk approaches.\n\nAs nightfall gathers strength, expect a soft veil of clouds to blanket the sky and perhaps a light drizzle just after dawn, not enough to dampen spirits but enough to refresh the earth. With temperatures settling around a mild 56 degrees, a light jacket or cozy sweater will be your companion. This is an evening inviting contemplation and quiet walks along the waterfront, or perhaps a gentle visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of roasted coffee mingles with the sounds of laughter. An ideal way to embrace the unfolding night while the city hums softly in the background.",
