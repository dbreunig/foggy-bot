    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the sun casts its gentle rays over the city, greeting onlookers with a high temperature just touching 59 degrees. The west wind sweeps through the streets, spirited and brisk, reminding all to wrap themselves in a light jacket or cozy sweater. As the day matures, you may notice clouds gathering, hinting at a change in the evening air, when the temperatures will settle around 52 degrees. A subtle chill drifts in from the west-southwest, ushering in a 60% chance of precipitation that might bring a soft drizzle for those out after dark.\n\nThe clarity of the day brings a certain sharpness to the scenery, yet the specter of the marine layer lingers just beyond the Golden Gate, forming a veil over parts of the bay, blurring the line between earth and sky. Those discerning enough may choose to indulge in a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, savoring the salty breeze while stopping by a cafe for a warm beverage. With the backdrop of shifting hues above, the day enchants with its delicate balance of sun and cloud, calling out for quiet moments spent in reflections of the city's ever-changing beauty.",
