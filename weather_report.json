    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, the city sits comfortably under a veil of clouds that has wrapped around it overnight, whispering secrets of the sea. The air carries a gentle breeze, hinting at the mildness of the coming day. With a low around a cool fifty-six, the atmosphere feels crisp, urging the night owls to find warmth inside while dreams linger on. As the hours turn, the sun will make its entrance, coaxing the city toward a pleasant sixty-six degrees, a fitting tribute to the charm of the bay.\n\nWith the fog often teasing the edges of the city, onlookers may catch glimpses of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge peeking through the mist, inviting walks along the waterfront to savor the serene beauty. The clouds will dissipate, leading to a day dappled with sunshine, but that coastal breeze from the west will maintain a refreshing edge, perfect for a light layer or a cozy sweater. Whether it\u2019s a quiet stroll through Golden Gate Park, a coffee by the bay, or simply sharing a moment with a book under the sun, the day's embrace beckons all to revel in its unassuming warmth and clarity.",
