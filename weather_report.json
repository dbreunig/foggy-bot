The temperature rests comfortably around 55 degrees, with a gentle west-southwest breeze that sways the treetops and carries a hint of ocean salt. As dawn approaches, the city will begin to awaken under blankets of gray, gradually stepping into a sunlit embrace as the day unfolds. The forecast promises a transformation, shifting to mostly sunny skies by midday. Though the high won't soar dramatically\u2014hovering near a modest 65\u2014temperatures will slide gracefully to about 62 by afternoon, keeping the day refreshingly crisp.\n\nThe allure of a late afternoon stroll along the Embarcadero is undeniable. One might dress in layers\u2014a light sweater or a breathable jacket, perfect for the morning chill that gives way to a more inviting warmth. Perhaps a casual caf\u00e9 visit, where the delightful aroma of fresh coffee mingles with sea air, calls out to the early riser. Throughout the day, one may savor the clarity that unfolds, as distant views like the Golden Gate Bridge emerge from the fog, inviting spontaneous adventures or quiet contemplation at waterfront parks. In this city where every twist and turn reveals a new layer, it\u2019s a perfect Sunday to take in the sights while recognizing the dynamic beauty that defines San Francisco, whether shrouded in mist or basking in sunlight.",
