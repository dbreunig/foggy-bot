    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens beneath a veil of soft twilight, with the gentle whispers of a southwest breeze tracing through the streets. The temperature lingers around a comfortable 61 degrees, suggesting a mild start, though clouds swirl overhead, hinting at the possibility of a sun-dappled day tempered by the coastal fog. While the horizon glimmers with fragments of sunlight, the forecast hints at a delicate dance with rain later in the day, particularly as evening approaches, when chances of drizzle rise slightly.\n\nAs the hours drift toward midday, the high will reach near 69 degrees, encouraging the belief that clearer moments will grace the city. The light winds may playfully tousle your hair, offering a refreshing touch as you venture outdoors. Yet, remember that San Francisco's charm lies in its unpredictable moods; it might be wise to keep a light jacket or sweater close at hand, especially if you find yourself in areas embraced by the marine layer, which often lingers near the coast, cloaking the Golden Gate in its ethereal embrace. This morning\u2019s conditions could provide a lovely backdrop for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet coffee in one of the city\u2019s hidden caf\u00e9s, where the promise of the day gently unfolds in every sip.",
