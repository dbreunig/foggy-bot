    "weather_report": "As the sun gently casts its warm embrace over Downtown San Francisco today, the horizon is clear, painted in hues of blue that hint at the day ahead. Expect the temperature to dance around a mild 64 degrees, with a pleasing west wind whispering softly at 9 to 16 mph, rustling the leaves and bringing a refreshing quality to the air. Tonight, the city will settle under a mostly clear sky, as the temperature dips to a comfortable 51. The gentle westerly breeze will continue, creating an inviting atmosphere for evening strolls along the waterfront or through the iconic parks.\n\nThe marine layer appears to have retreated, leaving the Golden Gate Bridge and the city\u2019s signature skyline defined and crisp against the backdrop of the bay. With no fog to obscure the sights, this is a fine day for a leisurely exploration. Those venturing outdoors might consider a light jacket for the brisk breeze, perhaps paired with layered clothing, perfect for sudden temperature shifts when the sun dips below the landscape. A visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or wandering through the neighborhoods to enjoy lunch at a sidewalk bistro, seems particularly appealing. This is a day to savor the blend of nature and urban life, quietly thriving in the heart of a city that encapsulates the spirit of the West Coast.",
