    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning greets us with a hint of cloudy skies, a prelude to the rain that whispers through the forecast. The air carries the promise of moisture, with temperatures lingering just above chilly. The winds from the west weave through the streets with a playful gust, reminding all to secure their layers against the brisk embrace of the day. As the clock moves toward the afternoon, the rain is expected to skitter away, giving space for the sun to peek through, though not without an occasional battle with clouds that may still linger.\n\nAs evening draws near, the skies will clear, offering a canvas painted in soft blues and golds, inviting evening strolls or a quiet refuge inside with a book. The marine layer, a familiar San Francisco resident, may still cloak the bridges in the distance, allowing glimpses now and again, but overall, clarity will return. For those planning their day, a sturdy jacket is a good companion in the breezy chill, layered thoughtfully for the warming sun later on. An afternoon in a cozy caf\u00e9, watching the city shift from rain-drenched to sun-kissed, might just be the perfect way to appreciate the shifting beauty of the day.",
