Dress in layers\u2014a light sweater and a cozy jacket will keep you comfortable as the west-southwest winds whisper through the avenues. Consider indulging in the warmth of a bowl of clam chowder from a beloved spot or simply savoring the peaceful ambiance of the city as day transitions into night.
