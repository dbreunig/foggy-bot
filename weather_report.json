    "weather_report": "As the quiet hours of the night unfurl in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle whisper of drizzle dances sporadically, accompanied by an enveloping blanket of clouds that keeps the city wrapped in a hush. The temperature hovers in the low fifties, while a mild breeze from the west-southwest flutters softly through the streets, hinting at the promise of dawn. \n\nLooking ahead, the day offers a distinct shift, transitioning from the moody shades of night to bright moments of sunshine. A chance of drizzle lingers until late morning, but the clouds will gradually part, revealing a pleasant, sun-kissed sky with temperatures nudging comfortably near 64. It\u2019s wise to layer lightly; a light jacket or sweater might serve well against the morning chill, while an afternoon of warmth invites a stroll through the city's vibrant neighborhoods. Perhaps take a moment to sip a warming cup of coffee in one of the quaint cafes, or enjoy the flowering gardens of Golden Gate Park. As the sun breaks the horizon, so too does the opportunity for a charming day ahead.",
