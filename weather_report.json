    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a brilliant blue sky, kissed by the gentle winds that dance through the streets. The promise of sunshine brings a comfortable warmth, with temperatures aiming for a pleasing 66 degrees, gradually receding to about 64 as afternoon settles in. The air is alive with the invigorating scents of the ocean, heralding the arrival of a refreshing west wind, which carries with it a whisper of the sea\u2014sublime yet bounded by the familiar rhythm of the city. Although clarity reigns today, the coastal embrace of marine layers seems to linger just beyond the Golden Gate, a subtle reminder of the waters ever-present nearby.\n\nAs the hours wane, the evening will usher in a peaceful calm, temperatures gently descending to around 50 degrees, leaving the world washed in the soft glow of twilight. Dressing in layers is the way to match the day's ambitions\u2014perhaps a light sweater for evening strolls, or something airy yet warm to carry through the bright afternoon. With such lovely weather, the city beckons you to take leisurely walks along the Embarcadero or find a cozy caf\u00e9 to enjoy a moment of tranquility. An adventure awaits, ready to unfold beneath the cheerful San Francisco sun.",
