    "weather_report": "As the night settles in Downtown San Francisco, a quiet clarity blankets the city, offering a serene escape from the day's hastiness. Tonight's low hovers around a cool 46 degrees, a gentle reminder of winter's lingering presence. The south-southwest winds whisper softly, brushing against the skyline, softly lifting the supportive veil that keeps the bay's secrets at bay. Though it is mostly clear, hints of fog linger at the edges of visibility, teasing the eye with a suggestion of the marine layer that's so characteristic of this coastal city.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, preparations for a delightful day emerge. The sun will rise, casting its radiant glow across the iconic bridges and bustling streets, promising a high near 62 degrees. As the warmth envelops the day, remember to dress in layers; a light sweater should complement your attire, allowing for adjustments as the afternoon temperatures fall to a comfortable 58. Consider a leisurely stroll through the prescient shores or a sit by a favorite caf\u00e9, where the aroma of brewing coffee mingles with the whispers of passersby. In this splendid atmosphere, the city invites little explorations\u2014perhaps delving into a local bookstore or meandering through the hidden paths of golden light that trace the hills. Enjoy the tranquil beauty of a San Francisco day, where each moment brims with possibility.",
