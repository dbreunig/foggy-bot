    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, this afternoon welcomes splendidly sunny skies marked with a hint of the city's characteristic marine layer, offering respite from the bustle. Temperatures hover near a comfortable 66 degrees, gently cooling to around 64 as the daylight wanes, kissed by a light west-southwest breeze that whispers sweet notes of the sea. While the horizon may display a delicate fog, the clarity remains largely unclouded, allowing the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge to stand proud against the cerulean backdrop.\n\nAs night draws near, the temperature is expected to dip to a cozy 57, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the distant twinkling of lights reflects off the water. For attire, layering is wise; perhaps a light sweater over your favorite shirt, complemented by a scarf to ward off any chill as the sea air sets in. This serene atmosphere beckons for quiet exploration\u2014whether it be to savor a coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or to wander the winding streets, enjoying the city\u2019s artful charm as twilight envelops the skyline.",
