A light westerly breeze whispers through the streets, carrying with it the faint scent of salty air, hinting at the nearby bay. The subtle interplay of shadows and moonlight creates a peaceful ambiance, perfect for a late evening stroll along the waterfront. \n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the morning will greet you with bright sunshine, promising a high near 69. As the day progresses, temperatures will dip slightly to about 67 in the afternoon, with a steady wind adding a refreshing touch. The absence of fog signals a clear and invigorating day, ideal for leisurely activities. Consider donning a light layer\u2014perhaps a well-fitted jacket or a stylish cardigan\u2014perfect for transitioning between the warmth of the sun and the cool breezes. A visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink and tantalizing pastries would complement the serene atmosphere, or a peaceful walk through one of the city\u2019s enchanting parks could offer a delightful escape into nature\u2019s embrace.",
