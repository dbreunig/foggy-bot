    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the sky remains partly cloudy, embracing a gentle warmth that marks a comfortable transition into the night. With temperatures hovering around 54 degrees, the air feels crisp but inviting, buoyed by a light southwest breeze that dances across the bay. The horizon, though slightly obscured by an ethereal veil of fog hugging the coastal edges, offers a captivating view; the Golden Gate Bridge peeks through, a resilient presence against the subtle mist. \n\nTomorrow promises sunshine, casting a cheerful glow across the city. Expect highs near 67 degrees, tapering off to around 65 as the afternoon unfolds. The city will feel vibrant, encouraging leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to one of the nearby parks, as the clouds retreat and the warmth beckons. Dress comfortably in layers, considering a light jacket or sweater for the evening chill. The joy of a day like this brings with it opportunities for simple pleasures: sipping coffee at a sidewalk cafe or exploring small shops tucked within the heart of the Mission District, where every corner has its own charm and story to tell.",
