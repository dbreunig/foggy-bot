    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle breeze carries the essence of the evening, though clouds linger, teasing hints of drizzle that may arrive after 11 PM. The air, cool and inviting, hovers around 58 degrees, suggesting that a light jacket or sweater will serve you well as you navigate the urban landscape. Should you venture out, the soft whispers of the west southwest wind, playful at 7 to 10 mph, will accompany your stroll, blending harmoniously with the city's nighttime melodies.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the dawn welcomes a promising transition. While there\u2019s a chance of the morning drizzle playing coy before 11 AM, the skies are expected to yield to brightness, allowing the sun to break through in its signature San Francisco way. The high temperature will flirt with 68 degrees, dipping to a comfortable 66 as the afternoon rolls in. For those heading out, light layers will be your best ally\u2014easily removable for the warmth that the day promises. With the possibility of the marine layer dancing along the bay, it might be wise to seek activities that embrace this playful dynamic: a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9 followed by a stroll through Golden Gate Park, where the palette of earth tones and lingering greens beckons. While the day may begin with a hint of gray, it surely evolves into an inviting canvas for exploration.",
