    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day is unfolding with a blend of sunlight and a fierce west wind that dances playfully through the streets. As the afternoon sun casts a serene glow, temperatures hover near 66 degrees, gradually descending to a cooler 64 as twilight approaches. The scene is punctuated by the crispness of the air, refreshing yet invigorating, hinting at a hint of the iconic fog that often blankets the coast. Though the skies boast clarity, the edges of the horizon may still suggest a whisper of the marine layer, teasing at a potential embrace of fog as evening settles in.\n\nAs night falls, the clouds will gather, wrapping the city in a gentle cover, cooling down to a cozy 57 degrees. With such conditions, a light jacket or a cozy sweater is advisable to combat the evening chill, especially against the winds that will continue to sway between 10 to 21 mph. This would be the perfect time for an evening stroll through the bustling streets, perhaps pausing for a casual bite at a local caf\u00e9, or simply enjoying the sounds and sights that make the city quintessentially San Francisco.",
