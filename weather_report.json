    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon reveals a calm, sunny demeanor, albeit tempered by a gentle coolness. The air, buoyed by a west-southwest wind, carries a refreshing touch that envelops the city as temperatures settle around 63 degrees. Yet, as the sunlight dips, a veil of clouds begins to creep in, hinting at the slight drizzle anticipated in the early hours of tomorrow morning. The Golden Gate stands steadfast, partially cloaked in that familiar marine layer that often graces the bay with its mystical charm.\n\nWhile the sun casts a pleasant glow, the overall clarity of the afternoon is softened by the impending cloud cover that will whisper of evening drizzles. It may be wise to don layers, opting for a light jacket to ward off the chill as the night approaches. As day transitions into night, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the gentle lapping of waves against the shore creates an inviting ambiance. Exploring the quiet side streets with a warm beverage in hand can also be a soothing way to end the day as the city prepares for the hush of nightfall.",
