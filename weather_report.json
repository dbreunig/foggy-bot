    "weather_report": "Evening in Downtown San Francisco brings a soft, enveloping embrace of clouds, hinting at the coolness that lies ahead. As the sun retreats, temperatures cool to a gentle 54 degrees, accompanied by a brisk west-southwest breeze that dances through the streets with gusts reaching up to 25 mph. The sky, covered in a gauzy layer of clouds, carries a promise of clarity soon to come. The evening feels alive yet subdued, offering a whisper of tranquility beneath the muted glow of streetlights and the distant hum of city life.\n\nAs Sunday unfolds, the promise of brightness beckons. Morning gives way to mostly sunny skies, with temperatures climbing into the low 60s, then gently tapering off as the afternoon progresses. The air holds a crispness that invigorates, even as the wind continues to play its rollicking games among the hills. Embrace the day by layering lightly, perhaps a light sweater or jacket to buffer against the playful gusts, ideal for an invigorating walk through the parks or a leisurely coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9. The atmospheric dance between sunshine and the lingering coolness hints at a day ripe for exploration\u2014perfect for a winding stroll along the Embarcadero, where the gentle lapping of the bay mingles with the sound of laughter and conversation.",
