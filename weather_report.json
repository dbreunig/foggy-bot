    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a delicate veil of cloudiness clings to the horizon, hinting at the possibility of rain later in the day. The air is crisp, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s, a refreshing chill to be expected from this coastal paradise. The gentle west-southwest winds whisper through the streets, cooling the morning. While there\u2019s a mere 20% chance of rain overnight, the forecast suggests a slight uptick as the day unfolds, with a 30% chance lingering until late afternoon. Rain could fall lightly before 4 PM, creating a soothing rhythm as it taps against the rooftops.\n\nThose venturing out would do well to dress in layers; a warm jacket will provide comfort against the cool breeze, while light, breathable fabrics underneath allow for adjustment as the day progresses. The marine layer may drift in and out, occasionally obscuring the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. On a day like this, exploring the quieter corners of the city is an invitation to enjoy the almost meditative calm offered by an early morning stroll through the gardens of Golden Gate Park or perusing a local caf\u00e9, where the scent of fresh brew mingles with the cool air. A day that could start with misty overtones holds the promise of a refreshing San Francisco speckled with periods of clarity.",
