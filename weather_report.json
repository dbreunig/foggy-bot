A cool breeze whispers through the streets, its gentle touch hinting at the impending twilight. The day\u2019s high drifts around 57 degrees, but as evening approaches, temperatures will gracefully settle to a cozy 50. Here and there, an expanse of clouds lingers in the sky, occasionally giving way to patches of bright blue, suggesting a playful contest between sun and shadow. \n\nAs night falls, the possibility of a light rain creeps in, particularly after one o'clock, adding a contrast to the day\u2019s mildness. The prospect of new rainfall is modest, likely bringing just enough to inspire the gentle scent of damp earth and fresh beginnings. In terms of attire, a light jacket or sweater would be suitable, providing warmth against the coolness of the evening while remaining comfortable for an easy stroll. The coastal city, with its unique mosaic of culture and charm, beckons you for a leisurely walk by the water, perhaps stopping for a quiet moment to enjoy a local caf\u00e9, savoring the hint of rain in the air\u2014a rare companion, reminding us of nature's subtle rhythms.",
