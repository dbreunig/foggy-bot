    "weather_report": "As the city of San Francisco awakens under a canopy of stillness, the night yields to a clear, gentle resolve. The temperature hovers around a comfortably mild 55 degrees, cradled by a soft southwest breeze whispering through the streets. Anticipation hangs in the air for the day ahead, set to unfold under the warm embrace of sunshine. By midday, the golden sunlight will drape over the city, inviting all to bask in its glow, though a subtle coolness will settle in the afternoon as temperatures meander downwards to around 61 degrees.\n\nVisibility appears promising this morning, with no heavy fog to shroud the iconic landscape. As the day breaks, expect clarity\u2014perhaps even a distant view of the Golden Gate Bridge standing proud against the horizon. For those wandering outdoors, a light layering of clothing would serve well: a breezy shirt complemented by a jacket to fend off the afternoon chill will ensure comfort as you navigate through the city\u2019s vibrant avenues. With such delightful weather, it might be an ideal time to enjoy a leisurely stroll atop Ocean Beach, savor a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, or explore the winding streets of the Mission, perhaps indulging in the culinary delights that await. The hues of the day beckon for an excursion, one that embraces both the energy of the city and the tranquility of the moment.",
