    "weather_report": "A gentle morning gives way to a day that promises to be mostly sunny in Downtown San Francisco, though the cool embrace of early fog may linger in the crevices of the bay as the sun rises fully. With temperatures nudging towards the low sixties, the air feels crisp and sharp yet refreshing, and the winds from the west northwest dance lightly, making a charming whisper amid the waking city. As the day matures, one might observe the temperatures subtly retreat back to the comforting chill of about 58 degrees, a sweet reminder that springtime here often wears a shroud of layers.\n\nWith a low settling around 50 degrees tonight, the evening beckons for light wraps to fend off the cooling air, especially as the sky turns partly cloudy, allowing a peek at the stars that will soon emerge. It is a fine day to indulge in leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps visit a cozy caf\u00e9, where the warmth of coffee can be savored while watching the city awaken. Opt for layers\u2014a light jacket to embrace the chill, perhaps a soft scarf to fend off the cool breeze\u2014and perhaps consider a well-loved hat; it\u2019s a practical day, one to relish the small joys of urban life wrapped in marine air.",
