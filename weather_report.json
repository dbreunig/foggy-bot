    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds drapes the city, hinting at the promise of a crisp evening to come. The air carries a palpable coolness, underscored by the low temperature settling around 46 degrees. The west-northwest breeze, modest yet refreshing, whispers through the streets, a reminder of the city's proximity to the sea. The Golden Gate Bridge, though looming out of the dimming daylight, appears partially cloaked in mist, a teasing nod to the encroaching marine layer that hints at its presence but refrains from encasing the entire city.\n\nAs the day shifts into night, the forecast embraces the optimism of a partly sunny Monday ahead, when temperatures may peak near 63 before tapering to a cooler 60. With a north wind promising to dance through the afternoon, casual layers are advisable for those venturing out\u2014perhaps a light sweater paired with a comfortable jacket to ward off the evening chill. Tonight\u2019s conditions are ripe for a quiet stroll along the Embarcadero or a serene visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s perched along the waterfront, where the comforting aroma of coffee mingles with salt air. Whether one seeks solitude in the reflective glow of the Bay or camaraderie in conversation warm with laughter, the evening invites all to find solace in its embrace.",
