    "weather_report": "In the gentle embrace of a San Francisco morning, the city stirs beneath a ceiling of scattered clouds, a blanket soft enough to keep the chill at bay while inviting the warmth of the sun to come forth. The temperature rests comfortably around 51 degrees, ushering in a West wind that dances through the streets at a vigorous 8 to 18 mph. The world feels alive with a touch of the ethereal as gusts swell up to 22 mph, whimsically tousling hair and ruffling jackets. Looking south, the fog lazily lingers near the Golden Gate, a subdued spirit that is far from haunting, resembling a soft veil that shrouds the day in mystery.\n\nAs the clock shifts towards mid-morning, the forecast promises a transformation: sunshine, radiant and unfiltered, will gradually dissolve the wispy remnants of morning fog, revealing a high of 62 degrees. The winds will remain spirited, maintaining their lively presence at 17 to 25 mph with gusts reaching up to 31 mph. Such weather calls for layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a windbreaker, ideally accompanied by comfortable footwear for those who might wish to wander the vibrant streets or revel in the tranquility found in a park. With the sun set to dominate, it is an opportune moment for a stroll along the waterfront or to lose oneself in a local caf\u00e9, savoring not just a cup of coffee but the essence of a city awakening, lovingly brushed by the brush of the sun and the playful kiss of the wind.",
