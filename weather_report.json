    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon emerges as a mingling of sun and shadows, marked by a brisk breeze sweeping through the streets. The atmosphere hints at uncertainty; the clear skies are punctuated by scattered clouds, a promise of rain that lingers just on the horizon. With a potential high of 53 degrees, it invites a layered approach to dress\u2014a light sweater beneath a windbreaker can offer both comfort and style against the chill of the west wind, which carries with it the familiar scent of the ocean. \n\nAs twilight descends, the clouds will thicken, and the foreboding of rain becomes palpable, arriving with certainty after 11 p.m. The city, often enveloped in the fog's embrace, might find itself momentarily clear, only to succumb to the heavier marine layer as night falls. Today is a transitory moment, as those with keen eyes might consider a stroll through the quieter parts of the city, perhaps a stop at a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink while watching the skies change. The evening promises to be cozy indoors, with the sound of raindrops beginning to tap on the window as you settle in for the night.",
