    "weather_report": "As night descends over Downtown San Francisco, a delicate veil of clarity graces the shores, though a subtle hint of drizzle may tease the city after 11 PM. The temperatures hover around a comfortable 60 degrees, inviting a light jacket or a cozy sweater, especially as the west wind whispers softly through the streets, occasionally gusting with a playful force. Tonight's peaceful ambiance is enhanced by the low chance of precipitation, only a mere 20%, suggesting you might stroll without worry of being caught in the rain.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, San Francisco awakens to the possibility of morning drizzle, which will swiftly give way to bright sunshine, illuminating the day with a gentle warmth reaching nearly 72 degrees. As the temperatures dip slightly in the afternoon, dressing in layers will be wise; a breathable shirt underneath a light outer layer allows for comfort in the fluctuating temperatures, while ensuring you\u2019re prepared for the fresh west-southwest breeze. Consider spending the afternoon in the embrace of the outdoors\u2014perhaps a casual walk along the waterfront or a quiet moment in one of the parks\u2014where the crisp air melds harmoniously with the invigorating sunlight, making for an altogether lovely day ahead.",
