    "weather_report": "In the quiet depths of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco rests under a clear canopy of sky, as the cool air envelops the city, whispering promises of warmth to come. The forecast hints at a cheery sun that will climb into the day, nudging the temperature to a gentle high of near 60, though it may settle back into the soothing embrace of the afternoon at 58. There\u2019s a tranquil breeze rustling through the streets, barely stronger than a whisper, encouraging passersby to step outside in comfortable layers rather than heavy coats.\n\nAs you meander through the bustling streets later on, the air feels crisp yet inviting, a perfect opportunity for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9, where you can lose yourself in a good book. The absence of fog this morning assures that the views are unobstructed, allowing the city to sparkle as the sunlight dances off its iconic architecture. While the marine layer lingers somewhere beyond, today\u2019s forecast provides the perfect escape from heavy clouds\u2014an ideal backdrop for those who wish to embrace the day in all its simplicity. Opt for a light sweater and perhaps a breathable scarf; the freshness of morning will soon yield to the comforting kiss of a sun-drenched afternoon.",
