    "weather_report": "In the early hours, Downtown San Francisco finds itself cloaked under a veil of clouds, the gentle embrace of a marine layer lingering just above. With a temperature around 60, the air feels soft yet cool, a prelude to the day promising modest warmth. The wind whispers through the cityscape, caressing the buildings with a light hand. As the sun awakens, expect it to break through the clouds, transforming the scenery. By midday, the warmth will lift to a comfortable 68 degrees, inviting those who escape the confines of their homes to enjoy the unfolding clarity.\n\nAs the fog retreats and the city's vibrancy comes alive beneath the sunlight, it would be wise to dress in layers. Consider lightweight attire paired with a light jacket, as the breeze from the west will toss temperatures slightly lower, urging you to adapt. The day offers many possibilities; perhaps it's the perfect moment to meander through Golden Gate Park or indulge in a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero. Whether sipping coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or exploring the charming contours of the streets, let the pleasant weather guide your steps in this invigorating coastal city.",
