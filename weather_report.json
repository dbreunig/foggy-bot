    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries the promise of rain, a gentle reminder of spring\u2019s unpredictable spirit. Currently, the low temperatures hover around a cool 53 degrees, accompanied by a soft, south-southwest wind whispering at ten miles per hour. A thick blanket of clouds stretches overhead, shrouding the city in a muted yet mysterious ambiance, and the impending rain showers are expected to blossom into existence after 11 PM. The anticipation hangs in the air, a 60% chance of precipitation that may add a delicate sheen to the city\u2019s streets.\n\nLooking forward to Monday, the skies will play a game between clouds and fleeting patches of sunlight, with temperatures lingering in the mid to upper 50s. The brisk west-southwest winds will pick up, possibly creating a chill that demands appropriate attire\u2014think layers, and perhaps a light raincoat to ward off the dampness. A walk along the Embarcadero could be refreshing, where the sound of distant soft rain mingles with the ebb and flow of the Bay, while a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 could offer solace from the evening's cool embrace. Engage in the moment; it\u2019s the kind of night that invites reflection and perhaps a good book, tucked away in the comfort of home as the heartbeat of the city softly hums outside.",
