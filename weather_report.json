    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day begins with a charming interplay of sunshine and clouds, casting a gentle embrace over the city. A high near 65 invites locals to step outside, while the gentle southwest winds playfully tug at the edges of your attire, creating a refreshing, temperate atmosphere. As midday approaches, the temperature gently dips, coaxing you toward cozy layers. The air carries whispers of the ocean, hinting at a subtle marine layer that defines the coastal character of this vibrant city. \n\nLooking toward the horizon, the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge emerges from a soft veil of fog, as though it\u2019s caught in a daydream. The atmosphere may feel brisker than the thermometer suggests, so a light jacket or sweater would be a wise choice, perfect for an afternoon stroll along the waterfront or gathering with friends at an open caf\u00e9. As the evening settles in with mostly cloudy skies, the temperature will cool to 54, and the winds will continue their dance, inviting reflective moments as nightfall approaches. Today is a canvas for simple pleasures: enjoy a casual walk in the park, explore a hidden alley lined with murals, or savor a warm cup of coffee as the light fades, letting the city breathe in its own rhythm.",
