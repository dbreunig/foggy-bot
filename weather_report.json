    "weather_report": "The early morning blankets Downtown San Francisco in a soft shroud of clouds, whispering promises of a cooler day ahead. The temperature rests around 54 degrees, a gentle reminder to take a light jacket when heading out. As the sun begins to awake with the day, the promise of clearer skies hints at the transition to a mostly sunny afternoon, with the warmth expected to nudge towards the mid-60s. Yet, the characteristic breezes from the west-southwest will sweep through, perfect for those who enjoy a refreshing air as they step outside.\n\nIn this coastal city, fog often drapes playfully over the hills and the iconic Golden Gate, but while it may lend an ethereal charm to the landscape, today\u2019s expected clarity portends a day with much promise. A few spots may still hold onto the marine layer, likely just beyond the view towards the ocean; however, in the heart of the city, a leisurely stroll through the vibrant streets invites you to embrace the awakening life around you. Comfortable attire will make the transition from the cool morning to the sun-kissed afternoon smooth, and a light sweater or cardigan would be wise to carry along, especially if your path leads to nearby parks or waterfronts. The afternoon sun will provide an exquisite opportunity for a laid-back picnic or a casual meeting at a caf\u00e9, perhaps savoring a warm drink as you watch the world move by, revealing the lively spirit of San Francisco.",
