    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, a whisper of clouds blankets the sky, casting an enchanting veil over the city. As the afternoon sun gingerly descends, temperatures hover around a cool 61 degrees, gradually retreating to a brisk 57 as the day wanes. The softly swirling west-southwest winds provide a gentle caress, hinting at the transformation of temperatures into the evening. The clouds above harbor little hint of fog, though the familiar marine layer lingers ever so slightly along the edges, a soft reminder of the ocean's proximity. This creates a muted brilliance, where the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge stands proud amidst the cloud-gilded landscape.\n\nAs night approaches, tranquility settles into the crevices of the city; expect temperatures to lower to around 48 degrees, accompanied by a slight rise overnight to about 50. The air, imbued with a crisp freshness, invites a layered wardrobe\u2014perhaps a light jacket or sweater, accompanied by a snug scarf to ward off any chill that may drift in as the sun departs. For those embracing the evening's charm, a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero presents an ideal opportunity to bask in the gentle sway of the bay's waters and the distant hum of city life, or perhaps discovering a quaint caf\u00e9 to sip a warm beverage while watching the luminescent cityscape pulse with a rhythmic glow.",
