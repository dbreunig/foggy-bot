    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day greets us with a mostly sunny visage, though the warmth is tempered by a persistent breeze sweeping in from the west. The temperatures are modest, hovering near 60 degrees, and dipping slightly as the afternoon progresses. While the sky flaunts clearer hues to the north, a touch of cloud cover is settling in, casting a hint of gloom as evening approaches. A brisk wind, gusting sharply, adds a lively twist to the air, hinting at the city's signature maritime influence. \n\nAs the sun retreats towards the horizon, expect a gradual descent in temperature, ushering in mostly cloudy conditions overnight. Such a scenario invites one to layer up thoughtfully, perhaps a light jacket over a comfortable shirt, perfect for an early evening stroll through the streets or a quiet moment with a book at a cafe, where the warm aroma of coffee fills the air. Outdoor enthusiasts might find solace in a leisurely walk by the waterfront, where the interplay of clouds against the still waters offers a subtle beauty, inviting moments of reflection as the day gently draws to a close.",
