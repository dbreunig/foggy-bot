    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a thick veil of clouds drapes the city, wrapping everything in a gentle embrace. The warm air settles, inviting a comfort that contrasts with the moderate breeze whispering through the streets. The temperature seeks the mid-fifties, and while the sky may appear heavy, the winds carry hints of refreshing potential, gently caressing one\u2019s face as gusts flirt between 10 to 15 mph, occasionally rising to 18 mph. The marine layer, a steadfast companion of the Bay, holds court, but with each passing hour, it quietly prepares to yield.\n\nAs dawn transitions to midday, Sunday promises to unfold with a tapestry of vibrant sunshine. Anticipate the temperature inching upwards to a pleasant 66 degrees, mellowing gradually to around 64 by afternoon. The clouds will part, yielding to broad swathes of blue sky, inviting strollers and sun-seekers to embrace the day. In light of the weather, dressing in layers remains prudent\u2014perhaps a light sweater complemented by a breathable shirt\u2014perfect for warmth in the morning chill, yet versatile enough for the afternoon glow. For those seeking refuge from the ordinary, consider a stroll along the Embarcadero or a coffee in hand while exploring the warmth of North Beach, inviting conversation and reflection under the afternoon sun. A day like this, although starting softly shrouded, offers golden possibilities as the sun climbs higher, illuminating the city in gentle radiance.",
