    "weather_report": "The sun casts a warm, golden hue over Downtown San Francisco this evening, illuminating the cityscape with a clarity that is almost unmatched. Highs around 67 degrees have brought forth a gentle and inviting warmth, with a soft northern breeze providing just enough chill to remind you that the ocean lies close by. As the afternoon wanes, we see temperatures beginning to ease into a comfortable 65, setting the stage for a pleasant night ahead. The air, largely devoid of fog, allows the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate and the city\u2019s skyline to stand sharp against a deepening blue sky.\n\nAs night falls, expect a tranquil and clear ambiance with temperatures dipping to around 50 degrees. For those venturing outdoors, think layers\u2014a light sweater or a cardigan would comfortably suffice. This is an evening for relaxed strolls along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping for a cup of coffee or tea at a local caf\u00e9 while enjoying the soft sounds of the bay. The lack of fog and marine layer allows the stars to make brief appearances, adding a touch of magic to a simple night out in the heart of the city.",
