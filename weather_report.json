    "weather_report": "San Francisco awakens to a canvas of gentle sunshine, the warmth of the day teasing the coolness that is typical of its coastal charm. As the morning unfolds, the haze of the marine layer retreats, granting a clear view over the bustling city, with the Golden Gate Bridge standing proudly in the distance. Temperatures are set to reach a pleasant peak just above the 70s, gradually easing into a more moderate clime by afternoon. A light breeze whispers from the southwest, inviting one to step outside and savor the mildness of the day.\n\nAs twilight falls, the evening promises to mirror the day's gentle ambiance, cooling to a cozy 52 degrees, ideal for a comfortable stroll or perhaps sipping tea on a quiet stoop. Dressing in layers will serve you well, cocooning against the chill that inevitably drifts in with the night. Today beckons for casual outings: perhaps a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the sunset glimmers on the water, or settling into a nook in a nearby cafe with a good book. This day, like many in San Francisco, offers a unique blend of warmth and coolness, the call of the outdoors harmonizing effortlessly with the spirit of the city.",
