    "weather_report": "In the gentle embrace of the night, Downtown San Francisco stirs quietly, beckoning the dawn with a promise of shifting skies. Overhead, the clouds build a soft, textured canopy, hinting at the possibility of rain before the early hours yield to daylight. As the west wind whispers through the city streets, the temperatures settle comfortably around fifty degrees, presenting a cool atmosphere that invites a moment of reflection or a leisurely stroll beneath the soft glow of streetlights. The air carries a touch of humidity, a reminder of the fleeting chance of precipitation, though nothing heavy at this hour.\n\nAs Sunday unfolds, residents can look forward to a gradually brightening sky, the sun fighting its way through the stubborn clouds. With temperatures reaching near sixty, the day promises a mix of clouds and sunlight, making it an ideal time for quiet outdoor pursuits. A walk along the Embarcadero, perhaps, or a visit to one of the city's many parks to breathe in the fresh air; it's a chance to engage with the city amid its evolving weather. Dress in layers to adapt to the cool morning and the warm afternoon, embracing the city's ever-changing character. Today holds the potential for pleasant discoveries, wrapped in the soft cloak of fog that often accompanies our beloved Bay Area mornings.",
