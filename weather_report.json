    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the air feels crisp, a gentle promise whispering through the west-southwest breeze. Skies are mostly clear, a canvas soon to be brushed by the muted hues of dawn. With temperatures settling around a mild 54 degrees, it's an evening that invites a light jacket yet holds the potential for warmth beneath the right layers. The winds, playful at 15 to 18 mph, offer a kind of buoyancy, lifting spirits among those who wander the city's storied streets.\n\nCome morning, the sun will burst forth, casting its brilliant light on the cobbled roads and iconic structures. The forecast boasts a high of near 65, but the true charm lies in the refreshing air, stirred by gusts that could flirt with 25 mph. The usual fog that drapes itself over the Golden Gate bridge appears to be holding back, allowing for sweeping views across the bay\u2014a delightful rarity that enhances the city's allure. As you slip into the day, consider donning layers: a lightweight shirt, perhaps accompanied by a cardigan or scarf, ready to shrug off the chill when the sun takes command. While the marine layer may lull to sleep elsewhere, today is perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or unwinding at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, savoring a warm beverage as the vibrant life of San Francisco awakens around you, heralding a day shaped by both clarity and the promise of golden light.",
