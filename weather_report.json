    "weather_report": "Morning light gently filters through a pastel sky over Downtown San Francisco, yet hints of the coastal marine layer linger. The air is cool, a subtle breeze whispers across the city, carrying a touch of dampness from the possibility of morning drizzle. As the day unfolds, temperatures will hover near sixty degrees but gradually ease into a softer warmth. Clouds will playfully dance with the sun, offering patchy brightness without fully unveiling the vibrant blue above.\n\nFor those navigating these transitional moments, a light jacket will serve you well against the cool winds, especially during the afternoon as temperatures dip slightly. It\u2019s an ideal day for a quiet stroll through the city's eclectic neighborhoods or perhaps a gentle coffee on an outdoor patio, observing the world awaken around you. Engage with the local art scene or meander through the myriad of shops, letting the day's temperate charm invite you to explore at a leisurely pace. The reassuring whispers of our foggy friend, now softened, remind us that between the urban landscape and the natural beauty of the bay, there exists a tranquil space perfect for quiet reflection.",
