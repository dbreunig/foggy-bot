    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, you find yourself bathed in the gentle embrace of a mostly sunny morning, the kind that hints at spring\u2019s arrival but still carries the crisp undertones of its predecessor. A soft wind plays at the edges, offering a pleasant soundtrack as you meander through the city streets. The forecast promises a high near 58, which sways between that comfortable warmth and a cooler afternoon touch as temperatures dip slightly. This early hour, however, invites a light layer; perhaps a cardigan or a light jacket, perfect for a jaunt along the Embarcadero or a leisurely coffee on a sunlit terrace.\n\nBut as day yields to evening, the air will shift and embrace you with the promise of rain that arrives after eleven. The clouds are gathering their strength, draping a curtain of gray over the horizon. With a 90% chance of precipitation, it\u2019s a good idea to tuck that jacket\u2014or a more substantial coat\u2014into your bag. You might consider a quiet afternoon at one of the city\u2019s cozy corners, perhaps perusing the shelves of a favorite bookstore or sharing a meal in the warm ambiance of a local caf\u00e9. The atmosphere is ripe for introspection as you watch the city transform, the sunlight yielding, preparing you for the rain\u2019s serenade that will soon usher in a refreshing change.",
