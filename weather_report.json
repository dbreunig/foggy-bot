    "weather_report": "As the evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, a gentle whisper of rain kisses the air, hinting at the moist possibility of precipitation. The clouds hang low, wrapped in a soft embrace, with the temperature resting comfortably around 62 degrees. A light southwest breeze stirs, weaving through the streets, while the prospect of rain lingers at 40%. Tonight\u2019s weather invites a light jacket or perhaps an umbrella, a precaution in the face of a hint of uncertainty that can only be embraced with an open heart.\n\nLooking ahead to the morrow, the morning may greet us with the lingering touch of rain, particularly before the sun manages to break through the cloud's shroud. By midday, a suggestion of sunshine may pierce the veiling clouds, offering brief respites of warmth amid temperatures flirting with the upper sixties. The breeze will pick up, gusting to 21 mph, weaving its way through the buildings. With the marine layer hovering, the iconic Golden Gate may remain enshrouded for a while longer. As you contemplate your day, consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to the Ferry Building, where the scents of pastries and coffee mingle in the air, a punctuated comfort amidst the uncertainties of the weather.",
