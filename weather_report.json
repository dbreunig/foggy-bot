    "weather_report": "As the sun drifts downward, leaving a gentle hue against the steadfast structures of Downtown San Francisco, the evening unfolds mostly clear, with a bracing chill cutting through the air. Though the day has been graced by fleeting sunshine, the cool embrace of a low temperature around forty-seven degrees invites a snug scarf, perhaps a light jacket\u2014to combat the evening\u2019s delicate bite, especially with the light winds whispering through the streets.\n\nTomorrow promises a dance of sunlit warmth, peaking near fifty-nine degrees, before gradually withdrawing into the comfortable arms of mid-afternoon coolness. The clarity of the sky is a tender invitation for a day spent meandering through open-air caf\u00e9s or bustling farmer\u2019s markets, where vibrant produce and fresh-baked goods beckon. The absence of fog, though a rarity by the bay, leaves a pristine vista\u2014ideal for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or quiet moments in the nooks of your favorite park. Wrap yourself in something cozy and soak in the beauty of a typical San Francisco day, as shadows lengthen and the city glows warmly under the gathering twilight.",
