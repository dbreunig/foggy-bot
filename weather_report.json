As morning unfurls into Sunday, expect a playful interplay of clouds and sun, with peaks of blue revealing themselves as the day progresses. The air will warm only slightly, reaching a modest high near 53, before slipping a notch by the afternoon\u2014a reminder of the ever-present maritime embrace this city knows so well.\n\nThe fog, with its ethereal charm, is likely to be lingering close to the ocean\u2019s embrace but may clear away to reveal a panorama of the iconic bridges and hills, albeit softened by the ever-looming marine layer. As for dressing for the day, layering remains a safe bet; a comfortable sweater or light jacket will serve well against any lingering chill and prepare you for the subtle winds as they whisper down the avenues. It\u2019s a day best spent enjoying the mellow glow of cafes or exploring the tranquil coastal trails, the streets adorned with the soft allure of the city, inviting a leisurely stroll amid the scenic beauty that is uniquely San Francisco.",
