    "weather_report": "The afternoon sky over Downtown San Francisco is a vibrant tapestry of blue, unmarred by fog or the typical marine layer, allowing the city\u2019s iconic skyline to shimmer in the golden light. With temperatures gracefully hovering around the 68-degree mark, it\u2019s a day to embrace the outdoors, especially as a gentle breeze from the west-southwest whispers promises of comfort. As the sun descends, the warmth will shift, coaxing temperatures down to a cozy 54 by evening, perfect for a light wrap when twilight descends.\n\nWith such clarity, this day is an invitation to wander. Consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the waterfront beckons and the city\u2019s charm unfolds at every corner. Perhaps a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 to sip a warm coffee as you bask in the sun's golden afterglow would be fitting. Attire that allows for both ease and warmth\u2014a light sweater or jacket to complement your ensemble\u2014will serve you well, accommodating the gentle whispers of the approaching night. Embrace the beauty while it lingers; today is a sublime reflection of San Francisco at its finest.",
