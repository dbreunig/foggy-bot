    "weather_report": "As the sun sets over Downtown San Francisco, the evening unfolds with a gentle embrace of clouds, a soft reminder that summer evenings can be deceivingly cool. The air is infused with a calm breeze, weaving through the city\u2019s streets, carrying whispers from the west. Temperatures retreat to a comfortable 56 degrees, inviting light layers to ward off the chill of the night. \n\nTomorrow dawns bright and mostly sunny, signaling a pleasant reprieve from the evening's clouds. The day is set to warm to the mid-sixties, with a steady wind that will coax the last remnants of the marine layer upwards, ensuring clear visibility as the afternoon sun glimmers against the water. The skies will remain relatively clear, offering a perfect backdrop for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet afternoon reading at a local caf\u00e9, enveloped by the warm glow of the sun. In light of the shifting weather, a light jacket or a cozy sweater will serve you well, ensuring comfort as you wander through the enchanting streets of this vibrant city.",
