    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a comfortable warmth, a prelude to a striking day ahead. As the afternoon sun casts its golden light, temperatures hover around a pleasant 71 degrees, briefly dipping to a more mellow 69 as the breeze brushes the skin. The west wind dances through the streets at a lively pace, whipping around corners with gusts that remind you of deep breaths taken in the fresh coastal air. Tonight, a whisper of drizzle may lightly kiss the city after 11 PM, but for now, clarity reigns supreme under a mostly clear sky.\n\nThis lovely afternoon invites a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering bay reflects the soft hues of the sun, unfettered by fog or haze. As the evening approaches, bringing slightly lower temperatures and a touch of humidity, a light jacket will serve well when the shadows deepen. Take a moment to relax at a caf\u00e9, savoring the taste of a warming beverage, or visit a local bookshop, letting the vibrant community envelop you until the embrace of night. The weather today paints a picture of a city alive with possibilities; one simply needs to step into it.",
