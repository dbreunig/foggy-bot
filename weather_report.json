    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the skies welcome you with a delicate embrace of sunlight, casting a warm glow that feels inviting despite the city's usual chill. A high near 67 degrees is anticipated, gradually tapering to about 64 as the day moves forward. The faint pull of the west-southwest winds, whispering at 3 to 13 mph, carries with them a refreshing touch that contrasts beautifully with the brightness of the afternoon. While the usual marine layer drapes itself on the horizon, it does not intrude on your view; rather it lingers at the periphery, offering a hint of the ocean beyond while leaving the city itself immaculately clear.\n\nAs the sun begins to dip, the evening promises a soothing calm with a low around 52 degrees. This presents the perfect opportunity to layer up\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a crisply tailored jacket to ward off the fading warmth. With such enchanting conditions, a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero beckons, leading you to discover the flavors of waterfront cafes or the quietude of nearby parks. There\u2019s a subtle thrill in the air, a reminder that even the familiar streets can offer moments of unexpected delight. Enjoy the day, for such clear skies in San Francisco seldom linger unnoticed.",
