    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the sky remains mostly clear, hinting at the charm of an evening under the vast expanse of blue. The gusty breezes whisper through the streets, gently reminding passersby that even in the face of warmth, the coastal chill lurks close by. With a low settling around 51, those familiar with these city winds might wish for a light jacket or sweater to embrace the evening\u2019s coolness. As the sun sinks lower, shadows elongate over the city\u2019s classic architecture, painting a serene picture of life winding down for the day.\n\nTomorrow promises a sunny reprieve, with the day beginning bright and the high reaching near 70 before recalibrating toward the late afternoon. The winds will dance in a similarly playful manner, beckoning residents outdoors to soak in the sunshine amidst the gentle sway of trees and the distant lapping of bay waters. Those who venture out might consider a simple stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the quaint cafes nestled between the hills, allowing the city's vibrancy to wash over them as they breathe in the fresh air. Dance in the fleeting moments of daylight, for such is the spirit of San Francisco's ever-shifting weather.",
