    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds under a mostly sunny sky, with a gentle breeze complementing the day\u2019s warmth. As the temperatures hover near a comfortable 69 degrees, you may feel a slight dip as the afternoon progresses, casting a serene ambiance over the bustling streets. The west-southwest wind, whispering at 10 to 14 mph, carries a hint of coastal freshness, while occasional gusts add a playful tug to your clothing.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the city\u2019s mood shifts; the sky begins to gather a cloak of clouds, bringing a mellow embrace to tonight\u2019s low of around 60. Although the fog is not predominant at present, the marine layer may soon roll in, softening the city\u2019s outlines and enveloping familiar landmarks in a dreamy haze. \n\nDressing in layers will serve you well today; a light sweater or jacket could provide comfort as evening settles in. Consider a stroll along the waterfront, where you can savor the beauty of the Bay against a backdrop of shifting colors, or perhaps enjoy a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many parks, listening to the soft rustle of leaves in the evening breeze. The day calls for tranquility and reflection, making it an ideal time to connect with the serene pace of life around you.",
