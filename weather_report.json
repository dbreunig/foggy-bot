    "weather_report": "As dawn lightly brushes the city, the air hangs cool and moist, a soft drizzle draping downtown San Francisco in a shroud of nostalgia. Clouds waltz lazily across the sky, casting their shadows over glistening streets that seem to echo the whispers of the bay. The Golden Gate Bridge stands like a sentinel amidst a whisper of fog, its silhouette barely visible, hinting at the ebb and flow of marine layers that the morning tide has brought in. With the sky brightening, there's a promise of sun breaking through the cloud cover, beckoning the city to awaken from its sleepy embrace.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, expect the weather to transform into a canvas that is mostly sunny and inviting. The gentle west wind carries a refreshing chill, encouraging layers; a light jacket or sweater paired with breathable fabrics will keep you comfortable as the day progresses. It\u2019s a splendid time to wander through the city\u2019s parks or indulge in quiet reflection at a nearby caf\u00e9, perhaps savoring a warm cup of artisanal coffee while watching the world slowly come to life. As lunchtime approaches, the city will tone down from its morning gray to reveal glimpses of warmth and radiant light, perfect for fleeting moments of tranquility away from the bustling sidewalks.",
