    "weather_report": "As early dawn kisses the rooftops of Downtown San Francisco, a delicate layer of fog lingers, softly blurring the contours of the skyline. The air carries a hint of moisture, promising the possibility of drizzle throughout the day, while the clouds above drift lazily, wrapping the city in a cloak of coolness. With temperatures hovering around 54, a light layer will serve as a perfect companion, keeping you warm against the gentle chill of the west-southwest winds. Expect the sun to peek through intermittently, though its presence may feel muted as it struggles against the marine layer that often cradles the coast.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the chance of drizzle remains, turning the afternoon into a tapestry of partly sunny and cooler moments, where the high temps will dance just above 65 before retreating slightly. This blend of weather invites contemplative strolls along the Embarcadero or an afternoon spent in a cozy caf\u00e9, perhaps with a warm pastry to keep your spirits high. Dress wisely in layers to embrace the shifting atmosphere, allowing the soft fog to envelop you while maintaining warmth and comfort. Thus, your Sunday in San Francisco holds the promise of tranquil joys amid the whispers of the bay.",
