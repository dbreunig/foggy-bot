    "weather_report": "The day dawns over Downtown San Francisco under a thick blanket of cloud, casting a muted gray light that whispers of rain to come. With the air thick and cool, a brisk south wind dances through the streets, carrying the promise of impending showers and stirring a gentle unease among those who venture outside. The hustle and bustle of morning life hums beneath this shadowy veil, where the Golden Gate Bridge stands cloaked in fog, almost ghostly in its elusive presence. Visibility is curtailed; the iconic skyline of the city, while still discernible, feels softened by this atmospheric embrace, lending a dream-like quality to the surroundings.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the clouds to weep more steadily, with rainfall projected to enhance the cityscape throughout the evening. A low that nudges nighttime temperatures gently upwards will maintain a chill, urging you to wrap yourself in layers\u2014a cozy sweater beneath a water-resistant jacket, perhaps, paired with sturdy footwear that can brave the slick sidewalks where puddles will gather. For those who feel at ease in the serenity that accompanies a rainy day, a stroll through local galleries or a quiet sit in a tucked-away caf\u00e9 might provide the perfect draping of comfort and warmth against the cool atmosphere outside, offering not just refuge but a chance to observe life unfurl quietly, like the petals of a flower embracing afternoon rain.",
