    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon downtown San Francisco, the waning light casts a gentle glow on the iconic skyline. The weather tonight is marked by a subtle shift toward calmness, with partly cloudy skies cradling the city in a soft embrace. The air cools gradually, dipping to a mild 51 degrees, with a light southwest breeze fluttering through the streets. While the murmur of evening life persists, an underlying tranquility blankets the area, inviting a reflective wander along the waterfront paths or through the soothing parks that thread through the metropolis.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, expect a day shaped by sunshine, with temperatures nudging toward a pleasant 64 degrees before gently retreating to a balmy 62 in the afternoon. A whisper of a southern breeze will accompany the daylight, making it an ideal opportunity to enjoy the vibrancy of outdoor caf\u00e9s or take a leisurely stroll through the neighborhoods. Dress in layers; a light sweater may be prudent for the morning chill, shedding it as the sun claims its position. With a hint of warmth in the air, where might one find themselves? Perhaps exploring the lesser-known corners of Golden Gate Park, indulging in a good book beneath a shady tree, or discovering a hidden gem of a gallery\u2014embracing the day with a sense of quiet discovery, savoring the charm of San Francisco in all its splendid complexity.",
