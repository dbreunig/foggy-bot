    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the sun graces the city, casting a warm glow against the clear blue backdrop of the sky. The temperature, peaking near a pleasant 67 degrees, will gently nestle its way down to a comfortable 65 by the afternoon, inviting inhabitants to revel in the day's mild charm. The air is permeated with a gentle northwesterly breeze, lending a refreshing touch that dances through the streets. As the evening approaches, the skies will remain mostly clear, with the temperature retreating to a tranquil 51 degrees, perfect for a serene night out.\n\nThe absence of fog signifies clarity, allowing the iconic landmarks of the Bay Area to stand boldly against the horizon. With such delightful weather, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront could be a rejuvenating escape, or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the soothing hum of conversation mingles with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Dressing in layers would be wise, as the warmth of the day may give way to a cool evening, and a light jacket could serve as a cozy companion as the twilight settles in.",
