    "weather_report": "As the night gently recedes into dawn, a crisp calm envelops Downtown San Francisco. The absence of fog accentuates the clarity of the skies, allowing for the faintest glimmer of stars to linger momentarily before the sunrise. The temperature dances around a cool 46 degrees, coaxing a light chill from the west-northwest, an invitation for a cozy layer. This early morning heralds a tranquil day; when the sun ascends, it will unfurl its rays to bathe the city in radiant warmth, approaching a high of 60 degrees. \n\nThursday promises an expanse of bright blue sky, with only a whisper of wind meandering through the streets. It\u2019s an ideal setting for a leisurely stroll along Market Street or a quiet moment in Golden Gate Park, perhaps sipping a warm beverage as the city awakens. Dress with care\u2014a light jacket or layered sweater will serve well against the lingering coolness while remaining comfortable under the sun\u2019s gaze as the day progresses. Embrace this perfect blend of serenity and vibrancy, where one might reflect or simply breathe in the simple pleasures of urban life.",
