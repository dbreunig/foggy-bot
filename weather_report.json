    "weather_report": "In the gentle embrace of the night, Downtown San Francisco rests under a veil of soft clouds, cocooned in coolness that beckons a light jacket for comfort. As overnight temperatures dip to about 48 degrees, the air carries a crispness that mingles with the distant hum of city life. Tomorrow promises a transformation, as the sun breaks through, casting its bright warmth upon the cityscape. The forecast calls for a high of 61, shifting to a cooler 58 by afternoon, while the north-northeast wind whispers softly, carrying the memory of the marine layer that often lingers close to the bay.\n\nYet, at this hour, the fog's gentle fingers shy away from the heart of the city, allowing for an unobstructed view of familiar landmarks. As daylight unfolds, the clarity of the sky will elevate the mood, inviting residents and visitors alike to wander outside, perhaps exploring the less-traveled alleyways or indulging in a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. With layers being the mantra of the day, a light sweater or a casual scarf will suffice against the morning chill. As the sun warms the pavement and heart, perhaps one might find delight in a quiet caf\u00e9, savoring a perfect croissant while the city awakens around them, embracing the simplicity of a day that is quietly filled with promise.",
