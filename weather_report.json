    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco greets us with a sunlit embrace, the high of around sixty promising a day pleasant enough for a wandering heart. As soft breezes waft from the north-northeast, the city stands clear, its edges slowly emerging from the remnants of a gentle marine layer. There\u2019s a definitive clarity to the sky, though the lingering fog can still be sensed along the coast, particularly around the Golden Gate, where it meanders like a ghost seeking refuge against the sturdy, sunlit cityscape. \n\nTonight, as twilight sweeps in, expect the celestial canvas to transition to a cooler low around forty-seven. There will still be a hint of warmth in the air, yet a light jacket or a cozy sweater would be wise as you venture out to partake in the evening\u2019s quiet allure. With such lovely conditions to walk among the vibrant streets or perch at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 with a good book, the charm of San Francisco is palpable at this time of day. So don your favorite layer, take a stroll by the bay, and let the gentle rhythm of urban life fill your senses.",
