    "weather_report": "As the night drapes its velvet cloak over Downtown San Francisco, the air is thick with the promise of rain, a reminder that autumn is ready to unfold its pages. The city lies beneath a tapestry of scattered clouds, their shadows dancing across the urban landscape, while a gentle breeze stirs, tracing secrets through the streets. With temperatures resting near a mild 61 degrees, the atmosphere suggests a damp embrace is inevitable, foretold by a 60% chance of precipitation that whispers through the trees.\n\nCome dawn, the sky will hold more of the same, a lingering gray softness punctuated by the melodic patter of rain. Highs will gently crest near 68 before sliding back down to a cooler 66, as the south-southeast winds carry the coolness from the bay. There\u2019s a chance that the fog, that ethereal blanket, lingers around the Golden Gate, complicating the horizon; one might expect a sight softened by mist, veiling the beauty of the bridge as it stretches across the water. Those stepping out should consider layered attire, a waterproof jacket being a smart companion against the gentle drumming of raindrops. Given the persistent moisture, a quiet afternoon indoors with a warm drink and a good book could prove delightful. One might even find solace in the local caf\u00e9, listening to the rain\u2019s patter while savoring a pastry, embracing the comfort of a cozy, rainy day.",
