    "weather_report": "As the city of San Francisco wakes, it finds itself draped in a layer of clouds, a gentle reminder of summer's lingering embrace. This morning's atmosphere carries a coolness in the air, whispering of the west-southwest winds that dance around softly, a prelude to what the day holds. The near-blanket of cloudiness will make way this afternoon for the sun to punctuate the sky, allowing glimpses of blue to spill over, while the temperatures will gradually pull back to a comfortable warmth. \n\nWith the fog still hanging around the more familiar corners and edges, its silvery shroud gives the world an ethereal quality that encourages contemplative strolls along the Embarcadero or through Golden Gate Park. Dressing in layers will serve you well; a light jacket should suffice for the nippy morning air, yielding to the sun\u2019s growing warmth by midday. Perhaps a leisurely brunch, a visit to a local gallery, or even a quiet bookshop will curtail the idle hours nicely, a subtle dance with this city that never seems to tire. So, embrace the charm of today\u2019s mellow skies and find delight in the beauty that hides in the folds of fog and sunlight alike.",
