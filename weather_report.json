    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a canvas of mostly sunny skies, though a gentle marine layer still lingers near the coast, hinting at the fog that often blankets this iconic city. As the sun rises higher, the chill in the air gives way to a mild warmth, inviting the city to embrace its lively pulse. The west winds carry the whispers of the bay, becoming a rhythmic reminder of the weather\u2019s playful character. While the high temperature nudges toward 64 degrees, by afternoon it\u2019s expected to settle into a comfortable 62, making it the perfect backdrop for a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park or an afternoon coffee on a sun-drenched patio.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the clouds will gather, cloaking the city in a soft gray, a stark contrast to the day\u2019s earlier brightness. The expected low of 55 will encourage a cozy layering of light sweaters and jackets, an ideal attire for enjoying a quiet evening walk along the waterfront or perhaps indulging in an intimate dinner at a tucked-away eatery. Even as the wind picks up, a gusty 24 mph reminding us of the bay\u2019s presence, tonight holds the promise of warmth shared and stories told among friends under San Francisco\u2019s captivating, ever-changing sky.",
