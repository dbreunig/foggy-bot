    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens to a crisp, clear morning that sings of sunny possibilities. The forecast promises a high around 61 degrees, but the refreshing chill lingers in the air, especially as the sun begins its ascent. The gentle northwest winds, caressing the landscape at a leisurely pace, add to the day\u2019s pleasantness, making it a perfect morning for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment with coffee at your favorite caf\u00e9, where you can soak in the atmosphere of the waking city.\n\nExpect the sun to shine brightly, dissolving any remnants of fog that typically embrace the Golden Gate. As temperatures dip into the late afternoon, a light sweater or a jacket may be wise when venturing out. Tonight, the skies should remain mostly clear, giving way to a tranquil evening, ideal for a peaceful walk through the streets or perhaps a visit to a favorite eatery, where a cozy atmosphere awaits. The air, mild and crisp, invites both reflection and companionship, making it a day to explore the beauty and vibrancy of San Francisco, undistracted by the usual foggy shrouds, offering a chance to revel in its iconic views.",
