    "weather_report": "As the twilight hours linger over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of gentle clouds envelops the night, hinting at the possibility of drizzle as the earlier coolness settles around you. With the mercury hovering around a mild 56 degrees, the city's atmosphere is graced with the soft whispers of a west-southwest breeze, rustling through the streets at a modest pace. The forecast suggests a continuation of this softness into the morning, with a slight chance of a few light droplets before the sun rises fully. By mid-morning, the city begins to shed its cooler cloak, revealing glimpses of sunshine that may tease through the clouds.\n\nAs you embark on your day in this embrace of urban beauty, dress in layers\u2014a light sweater or a stylish jacket will serve you well against the brisk morning air, gradually giving way to a more welcoming warmth as the day progresses toward a high in the low sixties. Downtown, you may find pleasure in a quiet walk through the parks, a leisurely coffee in one of the cozy caf\u00e9s sprinkled along the avenues, or perhaps a moment of reflection by the bay, keeping an eye out for the ever-dancing marine layer that can mystify even the most familiar of views. Today's forecast speaks of a landscape painted in soft pastels, an invitation to appreciate the gentle rhythm of life in a city that knows how to savor its secrets, even under the ever-watchful fog.",
