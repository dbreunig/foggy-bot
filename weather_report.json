    "weather_report": "In the heart of San Francisco this morning, a delicate clarity envelops the city, with sun-kissed streets basking under a soft azure sky. The high reaches just past a comfortable sixty degrees, inviting a leisurely stroll among the iconic architecture and vibrant locales. A gentle breeze carries the whisper of spring, complimented by the warm glow that enhances the charm of this unique urban landscape. However, as the day unfolds, a subtle reminder of the city's maritime nature lingers; by the early hours of tomorrow, the fog will weave its way back through the Bay, shrouding the Golden Gate in its mysterious embrace.\n\nFor those venturing out today, a light jacket is recommended, as the high may very well dip with the approaching evening chills. As the sun dips, the landscape may transform under a cloak of fog, particularly in the hours just after midnight, beckoning those who seek the serene quiet of the city. Consider a simple outing to one of San Francisco's beloved caf\u00e9s, where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with the melodic chatter of locals, or perhaps an afternoon walk through the Presidio, where nature\u2019s beauty offers a refreshing contrast to urban life. Each experience, curated by the weather, serves to remind us of the simple pleasures found in every corner of this magnificent city.",
