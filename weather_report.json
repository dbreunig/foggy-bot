    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a veil of clouds continues to cling to the night, but the promise of brightness lies ahead. The air, still cool with the lingering embrace of the marine layer, hovers around a crisp 52 degrees. Winds whip through the streets at a robust 17 mph, carrying with them the salty whisper of the Pacific. Residents can expect a shift by midday; the clouds will retreat to unveil patches of azure, inviting a sunny high of 61. Gusts may swell to 35 mph, adding a lively vigor to the day.\n\nWith these brisk conditions, dressing in layers is prudent\u2014think of a soft cardigan over a breathable tee, perfect for warmth against the early chill yet light enough for the anticipated warmth of the sun. A stroll along the waterfront could reveal stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge reclaiming its rightful place in the sun, or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 could provide a cozy retreat as the heats up. The scene is set for a day that, despite its early clouds, promises a vivacious spirit, urging us to embrace adventure beneath the city's iconic skyline.",
