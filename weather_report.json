    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Downtown San Francisco, a palpable stillness envelops the city. The forecast whispers of a slight chance of drizzle, suggesting the slumbering clouds may reluctantly release a tender mist, particularly before the sun fully awakens. Presently, temperatures linger around a cool, crisp 50 degrees, accompanied by a gentle west southwest wind that carries with it the promise of warmth to come. One might observe that the marine layer continues to weave a delicate veil over the landscape, particularly toward the west, casting a muted shade upon the iconic Golden Gate.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, expect the clouds to part, allowing for a modest embrace of sunlight that will gradually elevate the day\u2019s warmth to a comfortable 64 degrees, receding to something softer in the afternoon. Yet, the lingering coolness of the bay will remind urban dwellers of the coastal charm that defines this city. Prepare for the day by layering up; a light jacket or a knitted sweater will be just the ticket for early forays outdoors. With such conditions, the morning might invite a stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping for a warm pastry with coffee, absorbing the quaint atmosphere as the city comes alive. Later, the provenance of sunshine beckons a visit to a gallery or an open-air market, where the vibrancy of local artistry can be enjoyed without the interference of the morning haze.",
