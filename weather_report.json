    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the air is crisp and clear, inviting a breath of fresh air tinged with a hint of ocean salt. The sun breaks through to cast its warm glow, gently amplifying the vibrant colors of the city. With temperatures edging towards the pleasant low 60s, the strong westerly winds trail through the streets, delivering lively gusts that dance through the trees. While a modest marine layer lingers along the bay, it primarily keeps to itself, hinting at the charm of the coastal atmosphere without imposing upon the city\u2019s skyline.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect a subtle shift in mood, with clouds beginning to unfurl, and a light drizzle showing its face late in the evening. Tonight, the temperatures will settle to a soft murmur of 55 degrees, a perfect companion for a light jacket. Outdoor wanderings\u2014a stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a cozy caf\u00e9 visit\u2014will envelop you in the city's unique harmony, perfect for savoring a warm drink as the evening dims. Embrace the evening's possibilities, balancing casual comfort with a touch of warmth; a light sweater and comfortable shoes will have you prepared for whatever whimsy the night brings.",
