    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun graces Downtown San Francisco with a gentle yet invigorating warmth, as the weather unfolds in harmonious clarity. High above the bustling streets, a few fluffy clouds drift lazily, casting playful shadows while the west wind sweeps through the city, rustling leaves and promising a refreshing experience. As temperatures inch toward 62 degrees, expect a slight coolness to interject as the afternoon wanes. Suddenly, it becomes apparent that despite the sunny disposition, a marine layer lingers just beyond the hills, hinting at the ever-changing moods of this coastal city.\n\nAs evening approaches, the promise of mostly clear skies leads to a tranquil night, where the temperature dips to a comfortable 52 degrees. This pleasant shift invites wearers of light layers and cozy sweaters to stroll through neighborhoods, sampling the culinary offerings or simply enjoying the fresh breeze that carries whispers of the bay. For those drawn outdoors, the evening whispers a perfect invitation to a quiet walk along the Embarcadero, where the city's heartbeat feels alive against the backdrop of twinkling lights and the distant lull of water.",
