    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle anticipation fills the air with the promise of rain, gently tapping on rooftops as it arrives later tonight. The sky hangs heavy with clouds, obscuring the shimmering lights of the Golden Gate Bridge across the bay. The temperature hovers around a cool 51 degrees, with a soft wind whispering from the south southwest, rustling leaves and creating a symphony of sound amid the growing darkness. In the distance, the likelihood of rain is palpable, with a robust 80 percent chance that something wetter is on the way.\n\nLooking forward to Wednesday, expect a relentless cascade of rain to sweep into the city before the clock strikes five, with showers continuing intermittently, painting a vivid canvas of gray. Temperatures will retreat to about 52 degrees, beneath the watchful eyes of gusty winds reaching up to 32 mph. It would be wise to wrap yourself in layers; a warm, waterproof jacket paired with sturdy shoes will serve you well against the elements and the chill that permeates the air. As the day unfolds, consider a stroll through the city's rich tapestry of culture, perhaps stopping by a local caf\u00e9 to sip something warm, relishing the cozy atmosphere as you listen to the rain dance against the windows, reminding you that sometimes, the allure of a rainy day is simply irresistible.",
