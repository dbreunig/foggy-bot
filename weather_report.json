    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a light patina of clouds drapes the sky, hinting at the promise of rain later in the day. The air is still and soft, teasing at a mildness with temperatures settling around 62 degrees. The wisps of fog, characteristic of this coastal haven, roll gently in from the ocean, cloaking the distant golden frame of the Golden Gate Bridge, while the heart of the city remains veiled in a shroud of muted clarity. Shades of grey dominate this morning\u2019s palette, as the southwest breeze stirs softly, whispering promises of change.\n\nAs the day unfolds, a chance of rain showers lingers, particularly before the late afternoon, but the sunshine may intervene, casting patches of light through the cloud cover. The high will hint at the comfortable side, nudging around 68 degrees, yet the gusts could push through at 21 mph, making it feel a touch brisk in open spaces. It would be prudent to layer up\u2014perhaps a light jacket to fend off the chill or sudden sprinkles, and a sturdy pair of shoes for pedestrian ventures. A stroll through an art gallery or a cozy caf\u00e9 may provide the ideal refuge from the curious weather, where one can embrace the solitude and warmth while keeping an eye on the shifting skies.",
