The night sky reveals a mostly clear expanse tinged with a coolness that tempts a light wrap for the journey ahead. As dawn approaches, the low temperatures nestle around 46 degrees, with a gentle breeze from the north northwest whispering through the streets, adding a touch of crispness to the air.\n\nAs the sun emerges, the day promises a gentle embrace of warmth, with temperatures nudging near 60 degrees before settling into a comfortable 56 in the afternoon. The clarity of the morning holds potential for a stunning display of the city's iconic landmarks, though one might notice hints of the marine layer hovering offshore, laying low and distant, suggesting it may roll in later. Dressed in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket to shield against the morning chill\u2014residents and visitors alike can explore the vibrant streets or indulge in a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. With such soft skies above, consider a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, where warmth and comfort await as the day unfolds, inviting possibilities wrapped in the subtle charm of a city still emerging from slumber.",
