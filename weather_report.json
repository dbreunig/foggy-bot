    "weather_report": "In the gentle embrace of dawn, Downtown San Francisco is stirring beneath a veil of soft, wispy clouds that hint at a lingering marine layer, only beginning to recede. The air carries a crispness, holding steady at around fifty-seven degrees, touched by a west-southwest wind whispering through the avenues, giving life to the seemingly calm atmosphere. As the sun makes its ascent, expect the clouds to part just enough for a canvas of muted blue overhead, with temperatures dancing upward to around sixty-five, but trapped in the embrace of the breeze, offering only a slight warming sensation as the day progresses.\n\nThough sunlight might filter through at times, a sense of coolness remains ever-present, suggesting layers would be wise. A light jacket or a cozy sweater should suit you well on this day, as the winds may gust up to thirty miles per hour, reminding all who wander that San Francisco\u2019s charm can soften the chill, but never fully escape it. With the morning fading into afternoon, an outdoor excursion calls\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the views of boats gliding across the ever-changing bay will warm your spirit, or venturing to a caf\u00e9 for coffee, letting the aroma mingle with the fresh air, grounding you in the essence of city life.",
