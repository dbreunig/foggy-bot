    "weather_report": "The afternoon light bathes Downtown San Francisco in a soft, golden hue as the sun makes its presence known, despite the cool air that carries a brisk westward breeze. With temperatures hovering around a comfortable sixty-four degrees, there's a gentle warmth that invites residents to step outside. Yet, there\u2019s a notable shift as the afternoon unfolds, with thermometers likely dipping to around sixty-one. The sky, dressed in a sunny attire, seems to promise clarity; however, the wind, gusting up to twenty-nine miles per hour, murmurs secrets of the impending clouds that will softly blanket the evening to come.\n\nAs night approaches, a tapestry of gray will unfurl overhead, bringing with it a slight chance of drizzle\u2014a mere whisper of moisture that lingers in the air between eleven and five. With a low dipping to fifty-four, the chill will remind you that layers are a wise choice; a light jacket paired with perhaps a comfortable scarf would stave off the coolness. It\u2019s a night that lures you towards cozy corners of caf\u00e9s or the warm embrace of friends gathered over a shared plate. Embrace the touch of the season, for while the day showcases the sun's smile, the evening whispers tales of intimacy found in the comforts of indoor warmth.",
