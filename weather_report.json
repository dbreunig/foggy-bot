    "weather_report": "The dawn unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, framed by the soft embrace of dense clouds that hang low, casting a muted glow over the city. A sense of anticipation stirs in the air, hinting at the rain\u2019s gentle approach this afternoon. The high, only a whisper above 57, feels more like spring held back by winter\u2019s lingering chill. As the day progresses, the temperature will further dip, echoing the weigh of the clouds above, which appear thicker towards the horizon, veiling the Golden Gate Bridge in an ethereal haze. While the morning greets us with a 30% chance of rain before 4 PM, the thought of the cool, damp air invokes the cozy allure of a warm caf\u00e9, where the scent of brewed coffee mingles with the sound of soft chatter.\n\nAs evening settles in, an increased 40% chance of rain beckons, tempting wanderers to retreat into cozy corners of favorite bookstores or art galleries, where the mind may wander in delight. Those planning to brave the outdoors should be prepared, donning layers that offer warmth against the crisp wind and a light waterproof jacket to ward off the coming drops. Today is not so much a day for sweeping vistas but one for intimate connections, whether with a captivating read or the muse of local art, where one can linger and ponder away the hours.",
