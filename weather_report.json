    "weather_report": "As the sun glides towards the horizon, Downtown San Francisco basks in a warm embrace, where the blue sky stretches out like a calming sea. The afternoon reveals a gentle forecast, with comfortable temperatures hovering around the low seventies. A refreshing breeze whispers through the streets, carrying the scent of ocean air and the whispers of a city alive with languid energy. However, as twilight approaches, one should prepare for the possibility of a light drizzle after 11 PM, wrapped in a cloak of soft clouds that will cradle the night.\n\nGlimpses of the Golden Gate stand proud against the canvas of a mostly clear sky, though hints of lingering fog flirt at the edges of the Bay, promising to return as day turns to dusk. It's a perfect afternoon for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering waters reflect the glint of sunlight. A light jacket or a cozy sweater will suffice as the evening cools, allowing you to enjoy the city's vibrant atmosphere without discomfort. Perhaps one might find solace in a quaint caf\u00e9, indulging in a warm drink while watching the world drift by. Tonight promises the gentle embrace of nature\u2019s rhythms, inviting all to listen and connect with the heart of the city.",
