    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the sky blankets the city in a soft, muted embrace. The low hangs around the comfortable 54 degrees, inviting a gentle west-southwest breeze that rustles the leaves and adorns the air with a hint of oceanic freshness. You might notice the familiar silhouette of Sutro Tower peeking through the veil of mostly cloudy skies, while the gentle layer of fog, a staple character of this coastal town, lingers just out of sight, promising its typical dance with the city\u2019s contours by dawn.\n\nTomorrow's promise brings a transition into daylight where the sun will venture to reclaim the sky's canvas. As the day progresses, we can expect a brightening of spirits with highs flirting near 64, tapering off to a cozy 62 by afternoon. A west-southwest wind, playful yet not overbearing, will weave through the streets, hinting at the perfect backdrop for a leisurely stroll or an adventure to the piers. For the discerning sartorialist, light layers will suit the changeling nature of the temperatures, allowing for ease and comfort as you traverse the gentle hills of San Francisco. Why not explore the vibrant streets, take a moment to watch the boats meandering in the bay, or perhaps duck into a quaint caf\u00e9 for a warm cup, savoring the city\u2019s subtle beauty? The day\u2019s charm awaits, blending warmth and coolness in a uniquely San Francisco way.",
