Clouds gather, moving in like whispers of a forgotten tale, shrouding the iconic skyline in a soft gray. The temperature embraces the coolness of the evening, hovering around 53. With a gentle breeze from the southwest, the city is poised for a night of introspection, the probability of rain lending a tender melancholy to those wandering the streets. The atmospheric heaviness hints at the arrival of the wet weather, urging residents to abandon their light layers in favor of something more substantial.\n\nWith dawn still pending, Monday emerges under a similar spell\u2014a continuation of the cloud-laden narrative. The forecast suggests a high of 58, but a chill lingers, coaxing the temperatures downward by afternoon. As rain dances across rooftops and sidewalks, the chance of precipitation lingers like a secret lover; half-hearted but ever present. Dress warmly in layered clothing that can withstand the whisper of wind and the occasional drizzle. Consider cozy coffee shops and quiet corners where one can watch the world soak in the rain, or perhaps stroll through museum halls, marveling at the artistry housed within. In this gentle embrace of a weathered day, wanderers might find solace in simplicity, nurturing their spirits while the day unfurls in shades of gray.",
