    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, today unfolds with the kind of clarity that invites exploration. The sun casts a mellow light across the cityscape, and while the temperatures hover around a cool, comfortable 64 degrees, the afternoon brings a slight dip, settling closer to 62. The brisk west winds dance through the streets, urging you to tuck in your collar or don a light jacket\u2014especially as the steel blue of the sky mingles with the cotton-soft clouds that seem to gently hang over the Golden Gate. \n\nAs evening approaches, the atmosphere shifts to a welcoming embrace of partly cloudy skies, ushering in a refreshing breeze. With the low expected near 56, it\u2019s a perfect time to stroll through nearby parks or sip something warm at your favorite caf\u00e9. Today\u2019s weather whispers of possibility, urging residents and visitors alike to savor the pleasures of the moment\u2014perhaps an evening walk along the Embarcadero or indulging in a quiet moment with a book in a sun-kissed corner. The fog remains at bay for now, so the views are exposed, allowing the iconic architecture to shine in all its glory.",
