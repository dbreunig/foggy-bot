    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle cloud cover veils the skyline, hinting at a typical coastal evening. The chill of the air, wrapped around 51 degrees, merges seamlessly with the brisk west wind that whispers through the streets, occasionally bursting into playful gusts. There\u2019s a mere 20% chance of precipitation, but the atmosphere feels slightly damp, like the city is holding its breath before a delicate drizzle. The Golden Gate remains shrouded from direct sight, and a subtle marine layer lingers, betraying the hint of fog that often slips in during the night.\n\nTomorrow promises a reprieve from tonight\u2019s cloaked grayness, with a shift to mostly sunny skies. Daytime warmth will flirt around 60 degrees, inviting leisurely strolls through local parks or a warm cup of coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9. The winds will continue to dance, ranging in strength but often playful. As the evening wraps around this urban oasis, one might find comfort in layering up\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a cozy sweater, ideal for embracing the cool air while enjoying the vibrant nightlife. Engaging in quiet conversations over dinner, or simply reveling in the city's charming hidden corners, seems fitting for the conditions unfolding, as San Francisco exudes its characteristic allure.",
