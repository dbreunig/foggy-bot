    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun graces Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth envelops the city, balanced by the softly swirling winds. The high near sixty-three invites residents to step outdoors, where the sky stretches out in brilliant blue hues, unmarred by fog or haze. The gusts of wind, ranging from a mild sixteen to a spirited twenty-four miles per hour, playfully rustle the leaves of nearby trees, offering a refreshing touch against the warmth of the day. As twilight approaches, the skies will transition to a partly cloudy expanse, drawing in a temperature around fifty-six, although the invigorating breeze will persist.\n\nIn this inviting climate, donning a light jacket or sweater would be wise, especially for the evening stroll that promises cooler air after sunset. Perhaps a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, with the sights and sounds of the bay, would be a delightful choice. Alternatively, one might find joy in a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9, sipping a warm beverage as the city begins to glow under the dimming light. Whether out in the golden rays or beneath the coming night sky, it\u2019s a day to savor warmth and the vibrant life of the city.",
