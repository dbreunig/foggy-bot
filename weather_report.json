    "weather_report": "As dusk settles on Downtown San Francisco, the evening brings with it a refreshing coolness that envelops the city. The air, tinged with the crisp aromas of the coast, is partly cloudy with mild winds whispering from the west-southwest. A light chill brushes against the skin, hinting at the night\u2019s low of around 51 degrees. While the skies show glimpses of clarity, the marine layer lurks softly in the distance, swathing the horizon where the Golden Gate Bridge stands sentinel, a reminder of both beauty and the ever-present fog that dances with the bay waters.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the promise is of a mostly sunny day, though temperatures will graciously dip in the afternoon. Those venturing outdoors will feel the gentle push of the breeze, encouraging a light jacket or a warm sweater. It's a day that beckons casual strolls through the city, perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to relish the morning's quiet. A walk along the Embarcadero or a leisurely afternoon in one of the quieter parks can balance the tranquility of the day with the invigorating energy of urban life. With temperatures near 62 and dipping later, layering would be wise; a comfortable outfit paired with a scarf can make the transition from the lingering chill to the warmth of midday seamless and pleasant.",
