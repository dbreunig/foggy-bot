    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle gray veil of clouds blankets the city, casting a soft, muted tone to the surroundings. The expected high of 63 drapes itself like a warm shawl, dipping to a cooler embrace by the afternoon, when gusts from the west-southwest whisper through the streets. The faint presence of fog lingers in the distance, hovering near the Golden Gate Bridge, a fleeting reminder of the marine layer that often dances in and out of view, but the city remains largely visible, its iconic skyline peeking through the hazy shroud.\n\nThis day calls for layers\u2014a light sweater or a cozy jacket provides comfort against the chill, especially as the sun shyly plays hide-and-seek behind the clouds. It\u2019s a pleasant enough day for a leisurely stroll through the Presidio, perhaps a quiet moment spent with a paperback in one of its many serene spots. Alternatively, a visit to the Ferry Building could be inviting, where the aromas of freshly baked bread and artisanal coffee promise a charming interlude in the rhythm of this fog-kissed city. Enjoy the calm before the evening cloaks the landscape in its cool embrace\u2014the kind of tranquility that makes one appreciate the delicate balance of urban life and nature.",
