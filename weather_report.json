    "weather_report": "As the sun graces Downtown San Francisco this Independence Day, a crisp, refreshing clarity envelops the city. Waves of cerulean sky stretch across the horizon, punctuated by soft, wispy clouds that dance lightly to the rhythm of the westward winds. While temperatures linger near a comfortable 62 degrees, the warmth of the day will recede gently into the evening, making way for a cooler night around 52. Gusts whisk through the streets, adding a playful edge to this otherwise serene day.\n\nThe forecast hints at some subtle fog that embraces the edges of the Bay, particularly around the Golden Gate, blurred by the air\u2019s movement but failing to obscure the signature beauty of the city. As you wander outside, it would be wise to layer your attire\u2014perhaps a breezy jacket or light sweater that accommodates the occasional chill. This day beckons you to stroll along the Embarcadero, where the air is alive with the celebratory essence of the holiday. Let the vibrant spirit of the city draw you in, whether you choose to admire the waterfront or find solace in one of its quaint coffee shops, where conversations blend with the gentle hum of the day.",
