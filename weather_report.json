    "weather_report": "As the golden light filters through the city\u2019s weave, Downtown San Francisco is graced by mostly sunny skies. The day begins gently, promising a high near 65, with the warmth gradually mellowing into the afternoon, cloaking the streets in a tender embrace of around 62 degrees. A light west-southwest wind dances through the alleys\u2014a whispering breeze with the occasional spirited gust\u2014reminding all of the vitality inherent in this coastal enclave. Yet, as twilight approaches, the clouds will gather, wrapping the city in a soft shroud with temperatures dipping to around 55. \n\nOut in the streets, residents could find joy in a leisurely stroll, perhaps threading their way through cozy cafes or indulging in a glimpse of art in the galleries lining the Embarcadero. As the day strays into dusk, choosing layers becomes essential: a light jacket may be prudent to combat the cool night air, complemented by trousers that allow for easy movement between indoor warmth and the encroaching chill. The mist may flirt at the periphery, hinting at the marine layers that cast a gauzy veil over the bay, softening the skyline yet failing to overshadow the vibrant life pulsing below. It is a day to savor the simple pleasures, invigorated by the crisp air and the vibrant energy of the city, as the sun dips below the horizon, making way for a night of reflective calm.",
