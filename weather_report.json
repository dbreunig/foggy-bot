For now, the atmosphere remains clear, with a crispness in the air ushered in by a robust westerly breeze that brings whispers of the coast. Yet, as twilight approaches, clouds will gather, casting a gentle veil across the sky, hinting at the drizzle expected overnight.\n\nWith temperatures gently cooling toward a low near 54, dress for the evening may be best suited with layers\u2014a light jacket or sweater will offer comfort against the increasingly brisk evening air. The city, though welcoming, will soon embrace a foggy embrace once the drizzle graces the pavement, fusing the vibrant city lights into a softer, more romantic glow. As you consider how to spend your evening, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront could be a soothing option, or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the cozy, tucked-away caf\u00e9s, where the bustle of the day begins to fade into a mellow night.",
