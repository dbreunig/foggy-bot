    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, the gentle pulse of the city grows softer, illuminated by a constellation of streetlights and the shimmering bay. The skies remain mostly clear under the cloak of night, with a light southwest breeze wafting through the streets, creating a whisper that dances through the air. Tonight, the temperature dips to a cool 46 degrees, inviting a hint of warmth from a cozy jacket or a soft scarf. \n\nCome Sunday, the sun will grace the horizon, casting its glow and gradually lifting the afternoon to about 60 degrees. Though the day may commence with crisp freshness, you can expect a tranquil blue sky, unmarred by fog. The city\u2019s contours will become vividly pronounced against the clear backdrop, making it a perfect day for exploration. Slip on comfortable layers \u2013 perhaps a light sweater or a stylish windbreaker \u2013 and take a leisurely stroll through local parks, or find a quiet caf\u00e9 where you can savor a warm coffee while watching the world gently unfold. Whatever you choose to do, the conditions beckon a sense of calm and clarity, perfect for meandering through the graceful streets of this iconic city.",
