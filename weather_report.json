    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is marked by a gentle embrace of fog creeping in after hours of clear skies. It\u2019s a rather tranquil night, with temperatures settling around a mild 49 degrees, and a slight west wind bringing a refreshing coolness against the skin. The subtle haze from the marine layer hints at a softening of the horizon, where city lights manage to twinkle through the obscuring mist, creating an ethereal landscape that is both inviting and introspective.\n\nAs the sun rises tomorrow, expect remnants of that fog to linger briefly in the early hours, allowing the day to unfold into a canvas painted with warmth and light. The forecast suggests a daytime high near 66, featuring a reassuring shift to mostly sunny conditions. As the day progresses, temperatures will gently retreat to around 64, providing a comfortable warmth that encapsulates the best of the Bay Area spring. One might choose to wear layered clothing\u2014perhaps a light sweater, cozy scarf, and breathable shoes\u2014perfectly suited for a meandering stroll along the waterfront or a quiet coffee break at a sunlit caf\u00e9, where the lingering chill meets the rising warmth of the day. Whether one opts for contemplation along the promenade or an invigorating walk through the bustling streets, the day promises a gentle blend of comforting fog and brightening skies, perfect for indulging in the simple pleasures that such a beautiful city has to offer.",
