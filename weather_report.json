    "weather_report": "In the early hours of the morning, the streets of Downtown San Francisco find themselves cloaked in a soft, overcast veil. A whisper of drizzle flutters through the air, disappearing almost before it can settle. As the sun begins to rise, the clouds linger, casting a muted light that brings a quiet calm to the bustling city. The breeze, gentle yet invigorating, brushes past, encouraging anticipation for the day ahead. Looking forward to the hours that lie in wait, there exists a flicker of sunlight promising to break through, as the forecast suggests. By the late morning hours, expect a similar narrative \u2014 a fleeting chance of drizzle will give way to clearer skies. \n\nAs the city unfurls and the sun lifts higher, those venturing into the world will fight against the lingering chill of the marine layer. Dressing in layers is wise \u2014 perhaps a lightweight sweater or a light jacket for the morning, with the joy of shedding them as the warmth blossoms into an uplifting afternoon. The allure of this partly sunny day invites leisurely strolls along the Embarcadero, the clinking of coffee cups at an outdoor caf\u00e9, or indulging in cherished moments within one of the city\u2019s myriad parks. Beresford Park or Alamo Square could beckon, offering a space to bask amid the lingering whispers of fog that will retreat, leaving behind a day of clarity and promise.",
