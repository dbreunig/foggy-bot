    "weather_report": "As the moon drifts quietly into the early hours, the city embraces a calm, mostly clear night, with the temperature dipping to a comfortable chill around fifty-one degrees. The gentle southwest breeze stirs softly, infusing the air with a gentle refreshment. With morning on the horizon, the promise of a sunlit day beckons. By midday, the city will bask under a vibrant blue sky, temperatures climbing to a pleasing seventy degrees. \n\nThe forecast suggests that today will remain clear, offering splendid visibility across the bay. The usual encroaching marine layer, which shrouds the Golden Gate in its folds, appears to have momentarily retreated, leaving the iconic landmark proudly visible against the horizon. For those stepping outside, a light jacket will serve as a perfect companion, shielding against the coolness of the morning while remaining comfortable as the sun warms the day. A stroll through Golden Gate Park or a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero might just be the ideal way to embrace this pleasant weather, allowing one to unwind and enjoy the visual symphony that this lively city provides.",
