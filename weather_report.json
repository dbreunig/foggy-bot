    "weather_report": "As daylight gently wanes over Downtown San Francisco, the air remains crisp and fresh, marked by a surprising clarity for this time of year. The evening sky presents a mostly clear canvas, punctuated by the soft brush of low clouds that flirt with the horizon, hinting at the possibilities of a foggy embrace later in the night. Wind breezes lightly from the west-southwest, wrapping the city in a pleasant coolness, ideal for those seeking solace in a nighttime stroll or an outdoor gathering among friends.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the morning promises a continuation of this sunny clarity, albeit tempered by the allure of the marine layer hovering just off the coast. As the sun graces the day, temperatures will nudge up into the comfortable low sixties before gently retreating to cooler heights as the afternoon unfurls. Dress in layers, perhaps a light sweater or jacket for the morning chill that may follow you through the day. The cool breezes will accompany you, making it a perfect opportunity to explore the countless walkways of the city or savor a moment in one of its scenic parks. Let the adventure unfold as the city breathes easy under this moderate sun and clear skies, inviting you to enjoy its vibrant offerings.",
