    "weather_report": "As the soft murmur of the early morning envelops Downtown San Francisco, a light drizzle weaves through the patchy clouds, setting a cool and refreshingly muted tone. The air, carrying a gentle breeze from the west, whispers hints of moisture, with streets glistening as they catch the light of the dimly waking day. With temperatures huddled around the mid-50s, the city is adorned in a gauzy veil that promises both the intrigue of the fog and the allure of the sun's anticipated embrace.\n\nAs the hours drift toward noon, the promise of a partly sunny interlude looms on the horizon. The day holds a high near 66, easing into the afternoon with a gentle drop in temperature. For those journeying through the bustling streets, a light jacket or a long-sleeve shirt would be wise companions, keeping at bay the lingering coolness as the clouds gradually dissipate. The locals might find delightful ways to spend their day, perhaps savoring a quiet moment in a caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the refreshing air, or wandering into the warmth of shops that pepper the lively avenues. With the canvas of the skyline becoming clearer, the city invites you to meander through its streets, an excellent day for light exploration or an afternoon pause to appreciate the subtle beauty inherent in San Francisco's unique charm.",
