    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle embrace of cool air settles into the streets, tempered by patches of clouds serenely drifting beneath the inky sky. The temperature lingers around a balmy 50 degrees, with the soft southwest breeze whispering through the city. This is not merely a night of darkness but a canvas painted in subtle shades, where the promise of a new day beckons just beyond the horizon.\n\nCome Tuesday, the sun will ascend, lifting the veil of night to reveal a mostly sunny skies. While the high will flirt with the mid-60s, a subtle shift in temperature will usher in an afternoon that cools to a more comforting 62. The marine layer, often a silent presence in the Bay Area, lingers at the edges, ensuring a misty blush over the Golden Gate. One may notice a hint of fog clinging to the bridges, as if shyly retreating before the sun's warm gaze. This is a day made for winding walks through the neighborhoods or perhaps sipping coffee outdoors, as you observe the city's pulse beating anew. In dressing for the day, layering becomes your ally; a light jacket will serve well against the lingering chill that the evening brings. \n\nWith the day still young and the clock barely inching into the new hour, consider meandering through the quieter streets, embracing the calm before the bustle. A stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a nearby caf\u00e9 can provide simple pleasures that weave into the fabric of an otherwise ordinary Tuesday.",
