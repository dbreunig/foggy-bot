    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco basks in a gentle, sunlit afternoon, one that balances the warmth of a coastal summer with a soft, refreshing breeze. As the day moves toward its peak, clear skies beckon, with only a hint of cloud cover emerging to temper the sunshine. Despite the Liberty-like visage of the Golden Gate, the landscape feels open, inviting exploration\u2014if only to escape the heat within. The air, whispering promises of comfort, carries the scent of salt and earth, ripe for late strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment in a local caf\u00e9.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect a gradual enfolding of clouds, a harbinger of a cooler night. The temperature will settle in the neighborhood of a mild 57 degrees, marked by a subtle hint of humidity as the marine layer stirs from its slumber. Consider attire that embraces both warmth and style\u2014perhaps a light sweater to adorn your evening ensemble while enjoying a leisurely dinner al fresco or partaking in the unhurried delights of a nearby bookstore. With this delightful blend of sun, breeze, and coolness, the city invites you to savor its charms well into the dusk.",
