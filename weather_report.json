    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the night embraces the city with a gently enveloping blanket of clouds, whispering promises of a new day. The temperature lingers comfortably around 51 degrees, a mild prelude to the revelations of tomorrow\u2019s sunlight. As dawn approaches, the clouds begin their gradual retreat, giving way to an anticipated stretch of mostly sunny skies\u2014perfect for those who appreciate the invigorating interplay of light and shadow.\n\nAs the sun rises to meet the horizon, expect a high near 62, though a modest fall to around 60 will cast a cooler shade over the afternoon. The breeze, a gentle west-southwest companion, will flirt between 5 and 14 miles per hour, with occasional gusts that might dance playfully with your hair as you stroll. Current conditions might hint at a touch of fog, particularly in the early hours, where the marine layer pushes just close enough to evoke the city\u2019s classic, ethereal charm. \n\nDressing for this delightful Sunday could mean opting for lightweight layers\u2014perhaps a soft sweater or a light jacket that can easily be cast aside as warmth begins to radiate from the sun. As shadows lengthen through the day, take advantage of the weather's propensity for brightness; meander along the Embarcadero, savoring a leisurely coffee as you watch the world awaken around you. With the city's vibrant hues emerging, it is a splendid day for city exploration, quiet conversations, or even indulging in a picnic at a nearby park, all while allowing San Francisco's unique character to wrap its arms around you.",
