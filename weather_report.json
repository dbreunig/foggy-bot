Though the temperature is set to hover around a cool 62 degrees, the gentle west-southwest wind adds a playful twist, whispering through the streets at 14 mph and bringing occasional gusts that dance through the air. As the afternoon unfolds, the warmth of the sun will likely coax the temperature down to a comfortable 60\u2014an invitation for a stroll along the waterfront or through the city's charming alleys.\n\nAs the evening descends, clouds will begin to gather, shrouding the sky in a veil that mirrors the marine layer teasingly seen creeping towards the coast. The forecast predicts a low of around 53 degrees, so layering up with a light jacket or sweater will ensure you remain cozy during early evening outings or contemplative walks in the park. Embracing the tranquil ambiance of the city today feels particularly appropriate\u2014perhaps a quiet afternoon sipping coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9 or leisurely browsing a local bookstore. The shifting clouds and gentle breezes suggest a cinematic quality to the evening, perfect for reflective moments or engaging conversation.",
