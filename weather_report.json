    "weather_report": "As the evening darkens and the urban pulse of Downtown San Francisco slows, a whisper of rain lingers briefly in the air, with the chance of a light shower tapering off before 10 PM. Clouds blanket the city, casting a muted light across the streets below, where the temperature hovers comfortably in the low fifties. A gentle breeze from the west beckons. \n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, expect a continuation of the cloudy embrace, with the day starting at a brisk 63 degrees, gradually cooling into the afternoon. The southwest wind, soft and unhurried, will accompany your footsteps during leisurely strolls along the bay. Dressed in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater under a jacket\u2014you can prepare for the chill that encapsulates the later hours. With the silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge looming quietly in the background, why not take an easy walk through the local parks or explore the cafes nestled along the winding streets? Engage in a moment of reflection at a favorite spot, sipping a warm beverage while the city shimmers softly under the veil of fog by the coastline.",
