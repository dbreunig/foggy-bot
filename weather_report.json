    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds, Downtown San Francisco basks in the embrace of mostly sunny skies, a rare treat for a city often cloaked in fog. The temperature hovers around a cool 64 degrees, perfect for a brisk yet comfortable outing. With the colors of the city brightened under the gentle coaxing of a westerly breeze, now is a splendid time to take a stroll along the waterfront or savor a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9 terrace, perhaps with a warm drink to ward off the chill that inevitably creeps in as the sun descends.\n\nAs evening approaches, the forecast hints at a slight chance of drizzle after 11 PM. A veil of partly cloudy skies ushers in the night with temperatures dipping to around 50 degrees. If venturing out, a light jacket or sweater would provide the necessary warmth against the gentle, cool wind. Dress smartly to enjoy a leisurely walk up the hills for a view over the Bay, or an intimate dinner in one of the city\u2019s many charming eateries. Whether you choose to engage with the beauty of nature or the vibrancy of city life, the afternoon holds a promise of quiet satisfaction, enhanced by the characteristically mysterious allure of the San Francisco evening haze.",
