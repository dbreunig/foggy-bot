    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco greets you with a bright tapestry of blue skies, a gentle warmth embracing the day ahead. With the sun shining down, the temperature is poised to hover near a comfortable 64 degrees, dipping slightly as the afternoon unfolds. The air carries a hint of a soft breeze from the southwest, rustling through the city\u2019s iconic streets, inviting you to step outside and savor the weather.\n\nAs the day continues, the shifting clouds promise a blend of sunny and partly cloudy moments, with the evening expected to settle into a cozy coolness around 51 degrees. Although hints of fog linger near the bay, they seem distant, allowing the magnificent view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the skyline to dazzle in their full glory. Attire in layers\u2014a light sweater or jacket paired with comfortable pants will serve you well, as the marine layer may roll back in like a whispered secret after dark. Today is perfect for a leisurely stroll through the neighborhoods or perhaps settling at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 with a book in hand, letting the rhythm of the city serenade you through the afternoon light.",
