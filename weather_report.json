    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle shroud of clouds drapes the sky, blending shades of gray with hints of impending rain. The air carries a crispness, inviting a sense of briskness as temperatures linger around 50 degrees. A faint sigh of wind whispers through the streets, a portent of the shifting weather patterns on the horizon. While a slight chance of rain lingers in the night, it promises to remain an unobtrusive companion, with only a trace of moisture expected as we turn toward tomorrow.\n\nTuesday beckons with playful uncertainty, as clouds promise showers and perhaps even a thunderstorm. Daylight will filter through partly sunny skies, creating a contrast that mirrors the urban landscape\u2014vibrant yet subdued. Clad in layers, one might find comfort in a light jacket, perhaps with a hood to guard against any playful splashes from above. Consider a stroll through the winding streets, or perhaps a quiet cafe visit, as you savor the moodiness that accompanies such weather. The day might just tempt you to embrace the shroud of clouds and rain, making comfort your ally.",
