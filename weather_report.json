    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of fog dances at the periphery, hinting at the morning's languid embrace. The day unfolds with a promising blend of sunshine and a slight whisper of mist lingering in the air. As the mercury hovers around a comfortable 64 degrees, the warm glow of the sun mingles with a slight chill that's typical of our coastal nook. The breeze, a playful west-southwest wind, stirs softly at 6 to 13 mph, inviting you to step outside and relish the day.\n\nAs the sun begins its slow descent, shades of gray-mottled clouds gather, perhaps hinting at a slight chance of drizzle before night blankets the city. The early evening will usher in a cool, cloaking atmosphere, perfect for a slow stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to one of the inviting caf\u00e9s that dot the landscape, where the warm glow of lanterns offer comfort against the crisp air. Dress in layers, perhaps a light sweater over a breathable shirt, to fully enjoy the late day\u2019s serene embrace and prepare for the possibility of that subtle drizzle before it bids adieu to the day.",
