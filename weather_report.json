    "weather_report": "The day awakens in Downtown San Francisco, swathed in a moderate embrace of sunshine, casting a gentle glow on the city\u2019s contours. With temperatures near 66, the warmth invites one to linger outside, yet the forecast hints at a subtle shift in mood as the afternoon approaches, promising a slight dip. A playful west-southwest breeze rustles through the streets, whispering sweet nothings of the coming evening.\n\nAs twilight draws closer, the promise of patchy drizzle lingers on the horizon. Clouds begin to gather, suggesting a cozy night ahead with temperatures settling into the mid-50s. The chance of light precipitation floats at a modest 20%, allowing for adventures that can remain delightfully uninterrupted by the whims of rain. For those venturing out today, a light jacket layered over a comfortable tee will provide both solace against the mild wind and an appropriate shield for any unexpected sprinkles. One might find solace in a quiet bookshop, savoring a rich brew, or take a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the evening hugs the bay and the lights begin to twinkle like distant stars on the water's surface.",
