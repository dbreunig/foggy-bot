    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a gentle embrace of sun. The horizon, a canvas painted in soft blues and whites, reveals a clarity that invites wanderers to step outside and relish the crisp spring air. Temperatures hover cozily around 65 degrees, lending a pleasant warmth\u2014an ideal backdrop for those leisurely moments in the park or a stroll along the waterfront. The west wind carries with it the fresh scent of the bay, making one feel invigorated as the day stretches lazily toward dusk.\n\nAs evening approaches, the forecast hints at a shift; a low of around 50 beckons, but tonight\u2019s coolness will cradle the city beneath a blanket of partly cloudy skies. The marine layer has drifted away, leaving behind the serene visibility that characterizes San Francisco at this time of year. It\u2019s a fine moment to don a light jacket, perhaps a comfortable sweater to ward off the evening chill when the sun finally submerges below the horizon. While out, consider discovering a quaint caf\u00e9, treating yourself to a warm drink, or simply savoring the transformation of the city as the first stars begin to twinkle.",
