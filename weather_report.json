    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun bathes Downtown San Francisco in a warm glow, casting long shadows on the city's iconic skyline as it fights to break through the remnants of morning fog lingering near the Golden Gate. With a high hovering around 62 degrees, the chill is kept at bay by the brisk west-southwest winds, which dance through the streets at a lively pace, making the atmosphere feel invigorating yet cool. As you breathe in the crisp air, it\u2019s apparent that today will not surrender to the hazy marine layer that often cloaks this city; rather, it offers a vivid, clear sky that invites you to savor the sights.\n\nAs the evening fades in, expect partly cloudy skies to drift in, cooling temperatures to a comfortable low around 51. A light jacket or a warm sweater might be just the companions you need, especially when stepping out for a casual stroll along the Embarcadero or discovering one of the city\u2019s delightful cafes. The day is blessed with that gentle clarity that makes even the simplest activities feel like an embrace from the city itself. Perhaps visit a bookshop or enjoy a late afternoon coffee on a charming patio, watching as the skyline transforms under the waning sun.",
