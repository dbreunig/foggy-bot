    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the evening makes its slow descent, cloaking the city in a gentle veil of partly cloudy skies. Currently, temperatures linger around a crisp 50 degrees, accompanied by a mild west wind that whispers through the streets, offering a refreshing caress. The air is clear, with only the faintest hint of the marine layer creeping in along the bay. Tonight, the city feels comfortably cool, inviting outings that are not too ambitious\u2014a quiet stroll along the waterfront could reveal the glimmer of lights reflecting off the waters, a perfect moment to savor.\n\nAs you look forward to tomorrow, expect a mostly sunny day, where a high near 61 degrees will warmly beckon you outdoors. Although a few clouds may linger here and there, the sunshine promises to illuminate the vibrant colors of this unique cityscape. To embrace the day fully, consider dressing in layers; a light jacket or cardigan will suffice for the cooler morning and may easily be shed as the afternoon sun makes its presence felt. With this inviting weather, perhaps taking a leisurely walk through Golden Gate Park or engaging in a cozy outdoor caf\u00e9 visit could be the just-right remedy to invigorate your spirit, transforming the mundane into something pleasantly memorable.",
