    "weather_report": "As the early morning hours stretch across Downtown San Francisco, a gentle clarity washes over the cityscape, with the remnants of night lingering like a whisper in the air. The temperature rests comfortably around 44 degrees, hinting at a coolness that calls for layers as you greet the day. Dressed in a light sweater or a cozy jacket, one can step outside to embrace the dawn, perhaps savoring a quiet moment with coffee in hand, the soft breeze offering a welcoming touch.\n\nAs the day progresses, the promise of a partly sunny afternoon unfolds, though an impending chance of rain coaxes a slight chill into the atmosphere. By mid-afternoon, clouds may begin to gather, a prelude to a sprinkle from the heavens post 5 PM. The city remains mostly clear for now, an absence of fog allowing the iconic San Francisco landmarks to define the horizon without obstruction. As you stroll through the streets or enjoy the view from a favorite nook, consider a visit to a quaint bookstore or a local caf\u00e9 to take shelter from any subjects offering mild drizzle later. Embrace the day with an adventurous spirit, allowing the evolving weather to enhance your experience of this vibrant urban landscape.",
