    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere carries a gentle chill with a delicate moisture lingering in the air, hinting at the possibility of a light drizzle. The clouds hang overhead, softly diffusing the early light, creating a serene tableau that invites quiet contemplation. With temperatures hovering around the mild 55 degrees, the city's iconic hills and landmarks, such as the Golden Gate Bridge, may be shrouded in a veil of mist, reminding onlookers of the ever-present marine layer that graces our coastal haven.\n\nLooking ahead to the day, the clouds are expected to part, yielding to moments of sunshine that will illuminate the streets and offer a glimpse of warmth, with temperatures climbing toward a comfortable 64 degrees. A mild southwest breeze, persistent yet unobtrusive, will rustle the vibrant greenery, creating a gentle soundtrack that complements the city's rhythmic pulse. As the hours pass, this evolving canvas invites wanderers to venture into the neighborhoods, perhaps indulging in a leisurely walk along the waterfront or a quaint caf\u00e9 experience in the Mission District. Dress in layers; a light jacket will serve you well in the cooler intervals while allowing for ease as the sunlight breaks through. Today holds the promise of a moderate yet pleasant urban adventure, where the charm of San Francisco becomes ever more palpable under the shifting skies.",
