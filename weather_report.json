    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm descends over the city. The air is cool, settling into the low 40s, offering a refreshing respite from the warmth of the day. A playful west-northwest wind dances lightly, rustling the leaves and carrying with it the whispers of the bay. The sky remains mostly clear, the stars beginning to twinkle through the lingering urban glow. Tomorrow promises a lovely day, with the sun poised to break through, inviting a soft, bright essence to the streets. While temperatures will rise to about 59 degrees, expect a gradual coolness as afternoon draws near, a perfect opportunity to acclimate to the shifting weather.\n\nFor those venturing out, layering becomes essential; a cozy sweater or light jacket will ward off the evening's chill while remaining comfortably relaxed for the sunny escape of mid-day. This kind of weather beckons a stroll through the city, perhaps a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9 where you can enjoy a warm beverage, watch the world drift by, and soak in the delightful interplay of urban life and nature\u2019s subtle changes.",
