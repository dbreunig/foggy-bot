    "weather_report": "In downtown San Francisco today, the afternoon light bathes the landscape in a soft glow, revealing a city that vibrates with energy yet retains a subtle grace. With temperatures hovering around a mild 66 and dipping gently to 63, the weather feels welcoming\u2014a perfect embrace from the West Southwest wind gently stirring at 14 mph. The sun takes center stage, casting away the dreariness that often accompanies coastal days. However, a whisper of the nearby marine layer hints at the presence of fog, lingering just beyond the Golden Gate Bridge, like a gossamer veil waiting to descend.\n\nTonight, the sky will shift to a placid array of mostly cloudy blues, cradling a low of 57, as the breeze softens to a tender 6 to 13 mph, making it an ideal evening for a stroll through the city, perhaps along the waterfront or through the vibrant streets of North Beach. Layering will be key\u2014consider a light sweater or jacket to fend off the evening chill while indulging in the warmth of a cozy caf\u00e9 or a quiet moment in a park, savoring the simplicity of the day before it fades into twilight.",
