    "weather_report": "As the night deepens, a gentle cloak of patchy fog begins to unfurl over Downtown San Francisco, whispering its presence shortly after two. The air is crisp yet mild, resting around 51 degrees, kissed by a soft west-southwest breeze that nudges through the streets with a shy touch. Tomorrow, a delicate illumination awaits, as the early morning fog gives way to a sunlit sky. Expect a rising warmth peaking near 62 by midday, only to settle into a more tempered embrace of 59 as the afternoon embraces the city.\n\nThe fog, lightly draping the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate and the skyline, creates an atmospheric canvas, ephemeral yet magical. As the day unfolds, you might catch glimpses of the city\u2019s charm as it shines through the retreating haze. Consider donning a light jacket or a cozy sweater, perfect for flitting between the cool remnants of night and the gentle warmth of day. In this transitional weather, a stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a cozy cafe with a view could be just the remedy for the soul, as the city awakens and stretches under the embrace of sunlight.",
