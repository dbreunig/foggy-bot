    "weather_report": "As the morning settles over Downtown San Francisco, a muted stillness blankets the city. The promise of partly sunny skies offers a respite from the typical heavy fog that often lingers along the coast, though hints of a soft marine layer may shift in and out of view as the day unfolds. Temperatures gently climb toward a high around 58 degrees, taunted by a modest west wind that dances through the streets. The day appears clear enough to allow glimpses of the city\u2019s iconic landmarks, yet any plans should be mindful of a cool breeze that can cut through layers. \n\nAs evening approaches, the warmth of the sun will give way to a crispness that beckons light sweaters and jackets, perfect for an unhurried stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet seat at a caf\u00e9, watching the world drift by. Given the mildness of today\u2019s weather, engage in leisurely pursuits\u2014perhaps a visit to the Ferry Building Marketplace for fresh pastries or catching a nearby gallery exhibit that piques your curiosity. All the while, there\u2019s an unmistakable charm to the city in this transitional weather, where a simple walk can lead you into a world of unexpected discoveries.",
