    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco is draped in a thick layer of clouds, whispering promises of a day that will soon awaken to the sun's embrace. The murmur of a gentle southwest wind hints at warmth, even as the nighttime chill lingers, holding steady around 50 degrees. As the sun rises, it will unveil a canvas of mostly sunny skies, building to a high near 66. By afternoon, a soft decline to around 64 will settle over the city, lending itself to a day both cheerful and mild.\n\nThe promise of clarity may come with the occasional playful gust, lifting the veil of fog that occludes the world, particularly around the Golden Gate. While the blanket of clouds may obscure the iconic views first thing in the morning, it will give way to a more inviting atmosphere as the day unfolds. Given this interplay of weather, it would be wise to layer lightly; a light jacket or sweater should suffice for the morning chill, while by noon, a comfortable shirt will keep you at ease as temperatures rise. Take the opportunity to meander through local markets or find a quiet caf\u00e9 to savor the moment\u2014perhaps with a well-brewed cup of coffee to accompany the slowly warming streets, where the city comes alive again.",
