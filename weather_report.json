The air is clear and bright, unmarred by the morning fog that sometimes blankets this coastal gem. With temperatures expected to hover near 70 degrees, it invites you to step outside and embrace the day's promise. The westerly winds, playful yet steady, whisper through the streets, creating a rhythm that dances with the city\u2019s pulse. \n\nAs the day unfolds, the temperatures will gently dip to a cozy 68 by afternoon, a subtle reminder of the cool embrace of evening. Tonight, a soft layer of clouds will settle over the city, casting a serene mood as the temperatures fall to around 54. For those venturing out today, consider light layers\u2014a comfortable sweater or a light jacket will serve well against the brisk evening air. A visit to a quiet caf\u00e9, perhaps one with a view of the bay, might be the perfect way to savor these exquisite conditions. Or, take a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the charm of the city mingles with the calm of the sea, offering a moment of tranquility amid the bustle of urban life.",
