    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, a shroud of clouds grips the atmosphere, thickening to an almost palpable presence. Nestled beneath this quilt of gray, the temperature lingers in the upper fifties, offering a cool embrace to those out among the city\u2019s luminous streets. With just a whisper of wind, the air feels serene\u2014a moment suspended in time before the dawn of Veterans Day. Tomorrow promises a blend of clouds, but the temperature will rise, gliding toward a near-springlike seventy degrees by midday, before ebbing gently to around sixty-three as the afternoon drifts toward evening. \n\nThe day may start on a dull note, but there\u2019s an undeniable beauty in the way clouds soften the harshness of city life. The fog will linger in some corners, particularly along the waterfront, where the golden gates hold their breath against the warm tide of the Pacific. It\u2019s an ideal time for layered attire\u2014perhaps a soft cardigan over a t-shirt or a light jacket, perfectly suited for those ambles through Golden Gate Park or cozy gatherings at a neighborhood caf\u00e9, perhaps with a book in hand. While the weather may seem subdued, it invites exploration\u2014suggesting a leisurely stroll through the quieter streets of the Mission or a gentle bike ride along the Embarcadero, where the atmosphere shimmers with potential just beyond the haze.",
