    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the air is tempered with a gentle breeze, the remnants of night still lingering as a slight chance of drizzle passes. The sky is mostly clear, inviting the sun to crest over the horizon and warm the city, reaching a high of around 72 later in the day. Currently, a west wind stirs at about 14 mph, nudging any remaining clouds further inland but leaving the vista illuminated and sharp. Fog, a whisper of the marine layer, dances at the edges of the bay, hinting at the coastal coolness but staying at bay for now.\n\nAs the day unfurls, expect the warmth to settle in comfortably\u2014ideal for an afternoon jaunt through the streets. Consider layers: a light sweater to toss over your shoulders as the sun dips towards evening, complemented by a breathable shirt underneath. The city is beckoning for exploration, whether taking leisurely strolls to your favorite caf\u00e9 or visiting the local art galleries that remain a testament to the culture flowing through the streets. For those wanting to embrace the day, a walk through Golden Gate Park or a quiet moment at your go-to pastry shop seems fitting as a sun-drenched afternoon materializes.",
