The temperature rests at a chilly 54 degrees, a subtle reminder of the West\u2019s coolness even in warmer months. This prelude to Saturday promises a gradual lifting of the veil, as the sun is expected to break through, casting a warming glow over the cityscape by mid-morning. As the day unfolds, expect the mercury to flirt with 65\u2014a mild comfort just shy of summer\u2019s embrace. The west-southwest winds will dance through the streets, clocking in at brisk speeds, even teasing blustery gusts, challenging the more ambitious of hats.\n\nThe clarity of the day will improve, as the morning fog retreats toward the ocean, making way for a spectacle of soft sunlight spilling over iconic landmarks. While some marine mist may cling to the Bay\u2019s edges, the heart of the city will breathe clearer air, where you might find a cozy caf\u00e9 calling for your morning ritual, or a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero to relish the awakening city. Dressing in layers will serve you well; a light sweater or jacket will ward off those cooler morning whispers, while a comfortable t-shirt can freely greet the sun\u2019s touch later in the day. As the hours pass, consider grabbing a book and settling into one of the quieter parks or enjoying a soft afternoon laugh with friends at an outdoor eatery\u2014today holds the promise of a relaxed urban adventure, buoyed by the gentle hum of activity around you.",
