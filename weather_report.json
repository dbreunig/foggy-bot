    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, a refreshing mix of sunshine and wispy clouds paints the sky, creating a tranquil ambiance. Temperatures linger around a pleasant 64 degrees, but as the afternoon progresses, a gentle drift towards 60 blankets the city. The west-southwest breeze whispers softly, caressing the streets and stirring the leaves. The clarity of the day is striking, with only the faintest hint of haze lingering, suggesting the remnants of a receding marine layer rather than the thick fog often associated with our coastal weather.\n\nAs twilight begins to settle in tonight, the promise of a slight drizzle after 11 p.m. reflects the delicateness of the evening. With a low of around 50 degrees, one might find comfort in a light jacket or sweater, perfect for embracing the coolness while still allowing for a leisurely stroll through the city\u2019s charm. Tonight allows for quiet moments\u2014a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 or perhaps a gentle walk along the waterfront, where the soft sound of waves will blend seamlessly with the muted hum of the city. The evening is poised to offer a gentle lull, wrapped in the embrace of San Francisco\u2019s characteristic beauty.",
