    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day awakens under a blanket of mostly sunny skies, inviting the city to bask in the gentle warmth of a high near sixty. Yet, as the afternoon approaches, expect a soft descent to around fifty-eight, a reminder that this coastal great has a temperament as capricious as the tides. A brisk west-southwest wind dances through the streets, occasionally gusting with a spirited enthusiasm, rustling the leaves and offering fresh air that triumphantly sweeps away the remnants of any lingering fog. \n\nTonight, clouds gather in anticipation, ushering in a cozy low around fifty-two. The wind will remain spirited, a constant companion at thirty-three miles per hour at its most whimsical. Clarity reigns over the Golden Gate and the cityscape, suggesting a pleasant window for strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a leisurely bike ride through the Presidio. Both sun and cloud invite a layered wardrobe; a light jacket paired with something breathable for the afternoon sun should keep you comfortable and prepared for the cooler evening breeze. With the time inching towards daybreak, consider a visit to a local caf\u00e9 or a stroll in a nearby park. Relish the simple joys of the day as you embrace the ever-shifting beauty of this remarkable city.",
