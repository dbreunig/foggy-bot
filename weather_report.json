    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, a radiant sun casts its golden glow across the buildings, warming the air to a pleasant 64 degrees. The city lies beneath an expansive blue sky, dotted softly with wisps of clouds, while gentle winds from the west southwest whisper through the streets, providing a refreshing undertone to the ambience. As the daylight draws on, the marine layer seems to linger just a breath away from the shoreline, teasing the possibility of fog but holding it at bay, ensuring a clear afternoon filled with light.\n\nAs the evening approaches, expect a cozy shift, with temperatures dipping to around 54 degrees. The clouds will dance partly with the fading light, and mild winds will continue to sway, making it an ideal time for a leisurely stroll through the neighborhoods or perhaps sharing stories with friends over a cup of warm coffee at your favorite caf\u00e9. When dressing for the day, light layers offer comfort, preparing one for both the sun's embrace and the cool evening air. Embrace this exquisite San Francisco afternoon, each moment ripe for simple pleasures and quiet reflections.",
