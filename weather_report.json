    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks gently toward dawn, Downtown San Francisco is embraced by the lingering coolness of the evening, punctuated by the slight chance of rain that whispers through the night air. The city, still drowsy from the night, is cloaked in a modest blanket of clouds, offering a low, comforting temperature that hovers near fifty-seven degrees. A westward breeze carries a hint of crispness, conducive for those who choose to wrap themselves in a light sweater or a well-loved jacket. A mere twenty percent chance of precipitation hangs like a soft query in the air, suggesting a teasing possibility of showers before the sun decides to rise fully.\n\nCome Friday, the clouds will begin to recede, granting the sun ample space to spread its golden rays across the skyline, promising a pleasurable day ahead with temperatures reaching a mild sixty-six degrees. The westward winds will continue to dance through the streets, ranging from gentle to spirited, making it an ideal day for a stroll along the waterfront or into the hills where nature offers its beauty unabashedly. While the early hours may still harbor the faint traces of fog, expect clarity to emerge, revealing the verdant landscapes and architectural marvels that define this beloved city. A casual exploration of local cafes or a leisurely visit to a nearby park would blend seamlessly with the pleasant conditions, encouraging the embrace of both city life and the serene whispers of nature.",
