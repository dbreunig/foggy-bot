    "weather_report": "In the gentle embrace of a cloud-laden night, the temperature rests quietly at around fifty-one degrees, occasionally whispering through the air on the wings of a modest west wind. As the day unfurls, a promise of clarity emerges. The sun is poised to break free from its shroud of cloud, lifting spirits with the anticipation of a mostly sunny day. The high of sixty will gracefully descend to nearly fifty-eight in the afternoon, enveloped in a dynamic zephyr that sways between fifteen and twenty-four miles per hour, punctuated by sudden, lively gusts.\n\nAs dawn turns to day, the veil of fog clings to the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and the steep city hills, a testament to the marine layer that often drapes this majestic coastline. It is a day where the call of the outdoors resonates; perhaps a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the horizon is tinged with the soft hues of spring, or a gentle exploration of the bustling streets lined with caf\u00e9s, inviting the warmth of a cup of coffee against the chill that lingers. Layering becomes key\u2014consider a light jacket over a comfortable shirt, allowing for both warmth and movement. The day unfolds as a canvas, awaiting the impression of curious footsteps, cloaked in the essence of San Francisco\u2019s ever-enigmatic allure.",
