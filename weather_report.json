    "weather_report": "As we step into the afternoon hours of this clear day in Downtown San Francisco, the sun shines brightly, illuminating the skyline and creating a vivid backdrop against the bay. This light warmth will gradually settle, dropping to a cool embrace as the afternoon progresses. Winds gently stir from the west-northwest, offering a subtle touch that invites a comfortable stroll along the waterfront. The air is devoid of the usual fog that often blankets the city, allowing for splendid views of the Golden Gate, standing resolute against the azure canvas above.\n\nTonight, the skies will hold onto their clarity, transitioning to a crisp quiet at dusk as temperatures dip into the mid-forties. With a soft breeze from the southwest, it\u2019s the kind of night that calls for a light jacket or sweater\u2014perfect for gathering with friends at an outdoor caf\u00e9 or meandering through the peaceful streets, where the lingering glow of streetlamps will guide you. As you move, the gentle caress of the cool evening air will remind you that even in the brightest of days, San Francisco holds onto its breezy charm.",
