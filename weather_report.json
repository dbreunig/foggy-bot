    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, a distinct layer of clouds blankets the skies, casting a soft, diffused light that hints at the tranquil beauty of the evening. The current temperature lingers around a cool low of 50, with a gentle west-southwest breeze flowing through the streets, creating a soothing background to the city's rustle. The promise of a mostly sunny Sunday awaits, as tomorrow beckons with a high of 63, though the ambient warmth may feel more like a gentle embrace of 61 in the afternoon. \n\nAlthough the depth of the marine layer is not overwhelming at this hour, soft hints of fog can still be detected, particularly as you gaze toward the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, which may evoke whispers of the ocean's presence. One would do well to wear layers this evening \u2014 perhaps a light jacket to fend off the evening chill, paired with a comfortable sweater beneath. With such inviting conditions, a stroll through the neighborhood beckons, whether one chooses to admire the shimmering lights reflecting in the bay or simply indulge in a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9, basking in the serene yet vibrant spirit of the city.",
