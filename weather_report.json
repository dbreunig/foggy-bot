    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon sun bathes the city in a gentle warmth, while wispy clouds try to assert their presence without much conviction. With temperatures flirting near the mid-60s, the west wind dances through the streets at a lively pace, offering a refreshing contrast to the day's bright allure. Tonight, the sky will shift to a tranquil embrace of clarity, as the temperature settles into a comfortable low, encouraging an enjoyable evening for those outside. \n\nAlthough the marine layer may still linger around the edges, particularly near the Golden Gate, it does little to obscure the captivating views of this vibrant metropolis. As twilight approaches, consider a stroll along the waterfront, where the air is crisp and invigorating. The day calls for lightweight layers to adapt to the gentle fluctuations, prompting a light sweater or jacket as the sun dips below the horizon. Whether you explore a hidden caf\u00e9 or meander through the streets bathed in the golden glow of streetlamps, the evening holds the promise of relaxation and discovery in this ever-tempting cityscape.",
