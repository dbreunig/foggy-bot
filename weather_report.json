    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun warms Downtown San Francisco, a serene clarity washes over the city. With a high near 71 degrees, the air feels light yet invigorating, setting the stage for a delightful outing. The light winds from the west-southwest, brisk at times, bring a refreshing touch, while keeping the haze of fog at bay. The golden rays dance off the bay, illuminating the architecture and casting a warmth that invites all to step outside.\n\nAs the sun dips, expect a soft transition into the evening with a low of around 57 degrees. The sky will remain mostly clear, making it an optimal time for a quiet wander through the streets or perhaps sharing a meal at one of the many nearby bistros. Light layers will suit you well, allowing for comfort against the evening's gentle chill. Embrace the rich vibrancy of the city with a stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a local art gallery, where the beauty around will match the scenery beyond.",
