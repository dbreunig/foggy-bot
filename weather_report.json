    "weather_report": "As the city breathes a gentle sigh in the coolness of the night, Downtown San Francisco is layered in the soothing embrace of partly cloudy skies. A brisk west-southwest wind stirs, carrying the slight scent of the ocean, as temperatures slide into a comfortable 56 degrees. In the early hours, the air feels alive, both inviting and refreshing, promising a delightful respite from the day's hustle.\n\nCome Sunday, the sun will emerge with a confident clarity, casting its warmth over the city. By afternoon, the temperatures will gracefully hover around 65, and as the day unfolds, a sense of brilliance fills the sky, suggesting an afternoon that could be enjoyed outside. It's a day not overly adorned by the fog that often graces this part of the world, but rather, clear enough to appreciate the distant glory of the Golden Gate. The marine layer retreats, leaving behind a canvas suitable for leisurely strolls through the parks or intimate gatherings with friends, perhaps over a leisurely coffee in an outdoor caf\u00e9. For those venturing out, a light jacket would be wise, offering just the right touch of protection against the lingering winds, enabling one to bask in the day\u2019s simple pleasures.",
