    "weather_report": "As the evening falls over Downtown San Francisco, the air is tinged with a soft coolness, the kind that whispers of sea breezes and the promise of night. The clouds hang overhead, creating a quilted tapestry that dims the fading sunlight, while a light wind rustles through the streets, urging passersby to wrap themselves in something cozy. The forecast hints at a low of around 57, with gusts reaching up to 23 mph, a gentle reminder of the city\u2019s ever-present connection to its maritime environment.\n\nTomorrow promises a mosaic of partly sunny skies, hinting at the city\u2019s vibrant hues peeking through the clouds. Highs near 65 will beckon people outdoors, tempered by a whispering wind that will brush against cheeks. It\u2019s the kind of day that invites a stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to one of the charming caf\u00e9s nestled within the winding streets, where the local aroma of roasted coffee competes with the salt of the sea. For attire, a light jacket will serve well against the evening chill, while layers would prepare you for the mild day ahead. A simple walk along the waterfront, perhaps with a warm cup in hand, seems especially enticing as the daylight begins to fade, softly surrendering to the embrace of dusk.",
