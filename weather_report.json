    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a subtle promise of rain, echoing the forecast that predicts drizzles after midnight. A blanket of clouds looms over the city, creating a somewhat subdued atmosphere, with a low temperature that hovers around a crisp 50 degrees. The gentle north-northwest breeze stirs occasionally, adding a whisper of chill that suggests bundling up in layers would be wise. Tonight, the streets may glisten with any forthcoming moisture, and the possibility of a light mist will only enhance the city\u2019s ethereal charm.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the day promises to break with fleeting moments of sunshine, yet the clouds will persist, framing the high temperature around 57 degrees before dipping slightly in the afternoon. Gusts brushing in from the northwest will lend an air of briskness, reminding us that this coastal city holds onto its maritime character tightly even as spring begins to tease us with warmer days. Given the unpredictable nature of the elements, a well-prepared individual might find pleasure in a leisurely stroll through the Mission District, perhaps reveling in artisan coffee shops that boast their unique brews, or delving into the vibrant culture of local street art. All the while, it would be prudent to keep an umbrella handy just in case the forecast decides to play true to form.",
