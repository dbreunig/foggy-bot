    "weather_report": "As the early hours of Sunday unfold in Downtown San Francisco, a delightful coolness lingers in the air, hinting at the day's delicate promise. The atmosphere is bathed in a gentle overcast, with a comforting blanket of clouds softening the edges of the skyline. The temperatures linger in the mid-fifties, beckoning you to embrace a layered approach to your attire\u2014perhaps a light jacket over your favorite shirt might keep you preserved against the fluid caress of the west-southwest breeze, which dances around the streets with a briskness that's invigorating without being biting.\n\nAs the morning progresses, expect the clouds to part slightly, allowing pockets of sunlight to sneak through, illuminating the city with a warm glow. The high will reach into the low sixties, an invitation for leisurely strolls along the marina or a relaxed brunch at a caf\u00e9 where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the salty air. While patches of fog may stubbornly cling to the coastal outlines, obscuring the Golden Gate Bridge in gentle swirls, it adds a touch of romance to the day\u2019s ambiance. Allow yourself to be enchanted by this ethereal beauty, whether it's a quiet walk through Golden Gate Park or simply sitting on a bench, watching the life of the city unfold around you.",
