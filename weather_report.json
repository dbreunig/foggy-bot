The sky remains mostly clear, allowing for a gentle embrace of the cool night, with temperatures lingering around a refreshing 50 degrees. The soft southwest wind, barely a whisper at 7 mph, carries with it the promise of a new day. \n\nTomorrow greets us with a mix of sunshine and clouds, as the sun rises to unveil a day where the high peaks at around 60 degrees, retreating to a more subdued 58 as afternoon progresses. With winds from the west-southwest, ranging from 6 to 12 mph, the breeze will weave through the city streets, making it an appealing time for a brisk walk along the Embarcadero or perhaps indulging in a charming caf\u00e9 visit. As the fog stays at bay, the light and clarity awaken a sense of renewal. A light jacket or sweater will suffice for comfort, ensuring you are ready to embrace whatever spontaneous adventures the day may hold, be it a leisurely stroll to a favorite bookstore or simply relishing the open air amidst the cadence of city life.",
