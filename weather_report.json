    "weather_report": "As the night lingers over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle shroud of clouds blankets the city, hinting at the possibility of a light drizzle after 11 PM. The air, cool and crisp, carries a breeze from the west-southwest, rustling leaves and whispering secrets of the approaching dawn. Temperatures settle around a mild 57 degrees, a comfort for those tucked under layers or strolling under gray skies.\n\nThe morning will greet you with a soft chance of drizzle, especially before the sun awakens fully. Yet, as the hours pass, the clouds shall part, unveiling brief moments of sunshine that will dance upon the city, guiding the mercury to hover close to 66 degrees\u2014though it may dip back into the mid-60s as the afternoon unfolds. Winds will remain playful, brushing past at 10 to 21 mph, with occasional spirited gusts. The day presents itself as an ideal backdrop for gentle wanderings; perhaps one could explore the pedestrian trails of the Presidio, where the coolness of the air mingles with the fragrance of eucalyptus, or settle into a cozy caf\u00e9 with a book, letting time slow in tune with the city\u2019s heartbeat. Dressing in layers will be key; a light jacket will fend off the chill, while breathable fabrics beneath will offer comfort against the intermittent warmth of sunshine filtering through the clouds.",
