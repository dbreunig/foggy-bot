    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a brilliant sun, casting its golden rays over the cityscape. A gentle wind plays through the streets, promising a pleasant reprieve from the spring warmth as the temperature hovers near a comfortable 67 degrees. There is a refreshing clarity to the day, with visibility extending to the distant outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge, where the bay meets the sky in a seamless blue. Simply put, today feels invigorating, an opportunity to savor the outdoors without the intrusion of fog or the usual marine layer that can cloak this city in mist.\n\nAs evening approaches, the air will cool, wrapping around you like a soft blanket, with temperatures dipping to about 52 degrees under a canopy of mostly clear skies. It\u2019s the perfect chance to don a light jacket while enjoying a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps finding a cozy caf\u00e9 where you can watch the world pass by. As the sun begins to set, the horizon may be painted in soft pastels, creating a picturesque backdrop for a casual evening. Whether you choose to wander through the streets or simply sit back and absorb the atmosphere, the day invites you to embrace simplicity and the beauty of the moment.",
