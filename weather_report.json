    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a clear, brilliant sky, punctuated by a gentle warmth that dances around 63 degrees. The west-southwest breeze whispers at 13 mph, bringing with it a freshness that invigorates yet remains comfortable. While the horizon offers a view unmarred by significant fog, hints of the marine layer remain, veiling distant hills and lending a slight mystery to the otherwise sunny landscape.\n\nAs daylight transitions, a soft curtain of clouds may descend, ushering in a calmer atmosphere for the evening. The temperature will gently dip to around 52, perfect for a light sweater or a fashionable jacket as the shadows lengthen. The city\u2019s vibrant streets beckon for leisurely strolls: consider wandering through the quaint alleys of North Beach, stopping by a cozy caf\u00e9 for a quiet moment with a book, or sharing tales with friends over shared plates in a local bistro. Today\u2019s weather embraces the ordinary with a hint of charm, urging one to savor the pleasures of a sunlit San Francisco afternoon and a tranquil, cloud-kissed evening.",
