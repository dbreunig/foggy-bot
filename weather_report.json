    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a mellow tranquility settles in the air, the city still wrapped in the embrace of the night. A gentle cloud cover lingers like a soft blanket, with temperatures holding steady at a comfortable 52 degrees. The west-southwest wind whispers through the streets, breathing life into the coolness of the night, hinting at a shift to a brighter, more inviting day ahead.\n\nThe forecast beckons a partly sunny Wednesday, with the promise of temperatures nudging towards 60 degrees. The signature chill will remain, carried by a southwest breeze that stirs with promises of warmth yet keeps a hint of the bay\u2019s marine influence. Fog may loom in the distance, clinging to the hills and framing the Golden Gate with its ever-present mystery. But as the sun climbs higher, expect a clarity that will reveal the city\u2019s stunning vistas, inviting jaunts through its vibrant neighborhoods. \n\nDressing in layers would be wise today; a light sweater or jacket over a soft tee will help bridge the cool morning into the comfortable afternoon. Perhaps a casual stroll along the Embarcadero or a visit to the bustling Ferry Building farmer's market would be the perfect way to embrace the day's offerings. So, step outside, take a deep breath of that refreshing coastal air, and savor the unfolding charm of a San Francisco day.",
