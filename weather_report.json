    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a blanket of clouds, hinting at rain that lingers like an uninvited guest. With the temperature hovering around a cool 56, a brisk wind sweeps through the streets, inviting bursts of chill that tease the unwary. The distant Golden Gate Bridge, an iconic silhouette against a mottled gray sky, stands partially veiled, whispering to those who behold it the melancholy beauty of a spring day where warmth dances just beyond reach. As the afternoon wanes, a sprinkle of rain is likely to introduce itself, mingling with the clouds swirling above, suggesting that cozy indoor activities may soon be a welcome reprieve.\n\nFor those who venture out, dressing in layers proves wise; a light jacket or sweater paired with a scarf and comfortable shoes will provide the necessary comfort against the afternoon breeze and impending drizzle. Whether exploring the quiet joys of a local caf\u00e9, where the smell of fresh brew can warm even the most chilled spirit, or indulging in an afternoon of casual browsing through the shops, today offers a gentle reminder to embrace the soft, introspective side of the city. Let the clouds wrap you in their embrace, and anticipate the soothing sound of raindrops marking the evening to come.",
