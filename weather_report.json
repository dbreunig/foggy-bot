    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun casts a golden hue over Downtown San Francisco as it dances playfully behind a veil of clouds, promising a day of gentle warmth that lingers just above the coastal chill. With temperatures hovering around a pleasant mid-60s, the city exudes a relaxed vibe, beckoning locals and visitors alike to step outside and explore. The light west-southwest breeze, sporting occasional gusts, lends a refreshing touch to the air, perfect for a stroll along the waterfront or a cozy embrace in an outdoor caf\u00e9. \n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will transform into a quilt of clouds, with temperatures dipping softly into the upper 50s. In this transitional spell, layering is advised: perhaps a light cardigan over a simple tee will suffice, allowing for comfort as the day gives way to night. The lingering remnants of a marine layer may make their presence felt, particularly around the Golden Gate, lending a mystique to the iconic views. Tonight's cozy, cloudy ambiance may coax you towards an intimate gathering with friends or a quiet evening spent meandering through the dimly lit streets, where whispered conversations float into the twilight. Whether it's a leisurely walk or a spirited chat over coffee, the golden essence of San Francisco\u2019s charm is undeniably at play.",
