    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds under a canopy of bright sunshine, offering a pleasant retreat despite the brisk winds that dance through the streets. Temperatures hover around a mild 60 degrees, dipping slightly as the day progresses. As clouds gather in the distance, one can sense the marine layer not far from the horizon, hinting at the possibility of an overcast evening. The west-southwest winds, bold at 23 to 28 mph, serve as a constant reminder that this coastal city thrives on the brink of the ocean\u2019s embrace.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the clouds will thicken, creating an inviting atmosphere for those who enjoy a slightly cooler respite from the warmth. For those venturing out, layering is a wise choice; a comfortable sweater or light jacket will not only keep you cozy as the temperature dips toward the low 50s but will also provide a touch of stylish practicality against the wind's playful gusts. Perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the city lights kindle the bay\u2019s surface, could be an enchanting way to savor the day's waning light, or consider finding a quiet caf\u00e9 where you can indulge in a warm drink, soaking in the comforting ambience as the clouds roll in.",
