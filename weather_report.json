    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city unfurls under a tapestry of gentle sunlight. This afternoon promises a delightful retreat from the whimsical chill of recent days, with warmth finding a voice in a mild 66 degrees. The sky is adorned in a brilliant blue, showcasing clarity and lucidity, while the typical fog that shrouds the Golden Gate is momentarily at bay, allowing the majestic span to stand proudly against the horizon. A soft westerly breeze whispers through the streets, inviting residents to step outside and bask in the pleasantness of the day.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the ambiance shifts, with the promise of partly cloudy skies and temperatures settling around a cozy 55 degrees. The evening breeze will carry the hints of the surrounding ocean, perfect for wrapping oneself in a light jacket as one strolls along the Embarcadero, perhaps meandering down to a quaint caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of tea. It\u2019s an evening tailored for quiet conversations under string lights, while the slight breeze offers just enough nip to remind you that the ocean is never far away. Today, embrace the golden rays while they last, and prepare for a gentle transition into the night; it is a day best spent wandering and savoring the simple pleasures around you.",
