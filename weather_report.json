    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds beneath a fabric of cerulean skies, illuminated by a gentle sun casting a warm glow over the city\u2019s iconic skyline. As the temperature hovers around 63 degrees, a slight chill remains in the air, reminding one of the ocean's close embrace. The breeze, a soft whisper coming from the west-southwest, mingles with the aromas of the bustling streets below. It seems the marine layer has kept itself largely at bay, though faint traces of fog linger near the Golden Gate, like ghostly silhouettes dancing upon the water.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will transition into a tapestry of soft blues with hints of orange, heralding a mainly clear night ahead, where temperatures will dip to around 50. For those venturing outside, layering becomes essential\u2014think a light sweater paired with a comfortable long-sleeve, perfect for strolling through the quieter streets or relaxing at an outdoor caf\u00e9. This is a fine day for simple pleasures; perhaps take a leisurely walk along Crissy Field, enjoy a light meal at a cozy eatery, or simply find a spot to watch the sun bid farewell to the horizon. The crisp air energizes the spirit, inviting both reflection and connection in the heart of this vibrant city.",
