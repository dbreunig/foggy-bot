    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle murmur of fog lingers, shimmering like whispered secrets in the early morning light. An air of stillness blankets the city, with only the faintest drizzle accompanying the clouds that hang low, tempered by the cool embrace of a west-southwest breeze. The promise of day hints at a modest warmth, with the sun aiming for a peak of 64 degrees, adding a soft glow to the cool morning haze.\n\nAs the morning progresses, the patchy drizzle is expected to give way to moments of brightness. The fog, though still present, will start to recede, unveiling glimpses of the city\u2019s iconic skyline and inviting residents to explore its alleys and parks. Dress in layers today: light, breathable fabrics to accommodate the day's evolving warmth, but don\u2019t forget a light jacket for those cooler hours early on. \n\nConsider a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park, where the gentle rustle of leaves keeps company with soft conversations. Alternatively, a quiet caf\u00e9 visit could offer solace\u2014a place to sip warm coffee while watching the city awaken. Today promises a pleasant, mild atmosphere, ideally suited for taking in the subtleties of urban life while the fog gently lifts, revealing the charm of a city that is both familiar and mysterious.",
