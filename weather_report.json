    "weather_report": "In the waking hours of the day, San Francisco greets us with a touch of subtle melancholy. The air, cool and brisk, carries the promise of transient drizzles before the sun claims its place in the sky. The high of 64 feels refreshing, though temperatures will gently descend by afternoon, inviting those with a sense of adventure to embrace layers against the crispness. With a west-southwest wind kicking up at speeds that fluster leaves on trees, the slight gusts add a theatrical flair to the overall ambience.\n\nAs the light wanes this evening, clouds will gather like a gentle shroud. The promise of more drizzle between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. beckons a moment of stillness, perhaps best taken with warm tea in hand while nestled comfortably indoors. Dressing for this dynamic day could mean wrapping oneself in a light jacket or sweater, ready for the whims of the evening chill. Given the moderate clarity about the bridge, wandering through a tranquil museum or meandering along the Embarcadero could offer a pleasant reprieve from busyness, as the city transitions from the lively hum of midday to a serene dusk.",
