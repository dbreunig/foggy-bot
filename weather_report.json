    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning air carries a gentle suggestion of drizzle, a hint of moisture that whispers the coast's tendrils. As the day unfolds, you\u2019ll be greeted with mostly sunny skies, a comforting embrace with temperatures peaking around 63 degrees. The winds\u2014west southwest, brisk and playful\u2014will dance through the streets at speeds from 9 to 22 mph, occasionally gusting with a bit more thrill, reaching 26 mph. \n\nThe marine layer lingers subtly, teasing the skyline but retreating as the sun gains ground. Expect parts of the city to remain cloaked in a thin veil of mist, particularly around the iconic Golden Gate, where fog often lingers like an old friend. For comfort as the sun shines through, light layers will suit you best\u2014a breathable sweater or a light jacket should suffice. With these favorable conditions, a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero could beckon; perhaps find a quaint caf\u00e9 to settle in and watch the world drift by, or immerse yourself in the artistic currents of nearby galleries. A day like this invites a gentle exploration, revealing the city's character with every step.",
