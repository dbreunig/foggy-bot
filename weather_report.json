    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the skies present a canvas of clarity, marked by a mostly clear expanse. The temperature dips gently to a comfortable low, inviting the lightest layers to embrace the body while a soft breeze whispers through the streets, providing just enough chill to invigorate yet not overwhelm. As the evening deepens, the city sparkles beneath the stars, a mosaic of lights that glint against the dark, while the usual marine layer holds at bay, ensuring visibility towards the distant hills and glowing bridges.\n\nThe coming day promises warmth and brightness, with the sun rising to greet us in an embrace of mostly sunny skies. The temperatures are poised to linger near a pleasant high, allowing for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet coffee at a local caf\u00e9. It\u2019s a day tailored for the simple joys; a book in the park, a bicycle ride through the neighborhood, or even a visit to an art exhibit, as the gentle southwest wind carries the fresh scent of spring through the air. Light layers will suit the day well, providing comfort against the lingering hints of the bay's coolness. Take a moment to savor the beauty of a San Francisco day as it unfolds, weaving together the tranquility of nature with the vibrant pulse of urban life.",
