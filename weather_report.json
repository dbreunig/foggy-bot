    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Downtown San Francisco, an essence of calm prevails under a partly cloudy sky. The evening air carries a crispness that beckons a light layer, perhaps a light sweater, to ward off the cool breeze rolling in from the west. With temperatures dipping to around 52 degrees, the wind, dancing at 22 mph, playfully tousles hair and rustles leaves, occasionally punctuated by gusts that remind one of the city's vibrant spirit. \n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the sun will break free from its cloudy shroud, gracing the horizon with rays warming the day to a pleasant high of 62 degrees. As afternoon approaches, a gentle drop in temperature invites an easy adjustment\u2014perhaps a casual stroll along the waterfront where the clarity of the day reveals the intricate charm of the buildings and the soft outline of the Golden Gate Bridge. While fog may have momentarily receded, the marine layer whispers its return by evening, so don\u2019t forget that trusty sweater for the coolness of dusk. Days spent in the embrace of San Francisco\u2019s coastal air lend themselves to simple pleasures\u2014an early evening coffee at a corner caf\u00e9 or a leisurely wander through the warmth of local shops, embracing the city\u2019s artistic pulse.",
