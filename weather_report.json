    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a quilt of gray clouds, an anticipatory embrace that whispers of the day\u2019s gentle chill. The temperature hovers near 62, promising a modest warmth that will recede into the afternoon, where it will drop slightly to around 60. A light southwest breeze ruffles the air, creating a soothing backdrop as the city awakens. This close coverage hints at the presence of the typical coastal marine layer, albeit not thick enough to shroud the iconic skyline in mystery; instead, it offers a muted, yet serene landscape, framed by the silhouettes of the Golden Gate Bridge and the hills beyond.\n\nAs the evening approaches, the clouds will continue their soft waltz, settling to a low of about 51, inviting one to don layers for comfort. Perhaps a light sweater over a casual shirt would suffice, perfect for a stroll through the quieter neighborhoods adorned with budding spring flowers. With such conditions, one might consider a leisurely walk to a local caf\u00e9, savoring the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee or tea. Reading a book at one of the cozy nooks scattered throughout town or simply finding a bench to watch the world drift by offers a pleasant escape from the bustling pace of urban life. Take the day as an opportunity to meander, allowing the ever-changing sky to soothe and inspire.",
