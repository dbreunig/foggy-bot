The clouds, heavy yet understated, embrace the city with a soft veil, while a gentle west-southwest wind whispers through the streets. The temperature hovers around a mild 55 degrees, inviting layers for those venturing out. \n\nTomorrow dawns with the promise of clarity\u2014a reprieve as the slight chance of morning drizzle gives way to bright patches of sunshine. With a high expected near 64 degrees, the day will slowly unfurl into a gentle warmth under the protection of a clear sky, albeit with hints of the marine layer still lingering at the fringes. Those heading out might find comfort in a light jacket layered over a casual shirt, perfect for both the cool morning air and the pleasant afternoon. As the city awakens, a stroll along the Embarcadero could be an idyllic choice, offering a chance to bask in the evolving light and the rhythm of the bay, or simply sipping coffee at a local caf\u00e9, absorbing the tranquility before the day fully unfolds.",
