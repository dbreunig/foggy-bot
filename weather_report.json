    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this Tuesday morning, a gentle murmur of drizzle whispers against the windows of Downtown San Francisco, casting a slight sheen on the streets. The clouds linger overhead in a mostly gray embrace, with only hints of sunlight peeking through to offer a promise of warmth as the day unfolds. The air carries the briskness of the Southwest winds, a reassuring 7 to 13 mph, that might tug at the edges of a light jacket or cardigan, making it a perfect companion for those early risers venturing out.\n\nAs the sun ascends, expect a transformation; the drizzle will wane, giving way to brighter periods, slowly awakening the city's vibrancy. The high will shy towards a comfortable 64 degrees, beckoning one to shed the morning's chill layers in favor of something lighter. The lightness of the day seems ideal for an easy stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to the local coffee shop, where the scent of freshly brewed warmth calls. This day, while not entirely hazy, will find its clarity simmering just beneath the clouds, hinting at the beauty that lies in between. Dress warmly but not overly so, as the afternoon promises a gentle ease, perfect for savoring the city\u2019s delightfully unhurried pace.",
