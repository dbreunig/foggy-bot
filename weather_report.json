As the forecast suggests, a low marine layer hugs the coast, indistinct but present in its fleeting touches. Temperatures settled around a crisp 52 degrees, complemented by a vivacious west wind that stirs the air with playful gusts, keeping the day feeling refreshingly cool. \n\nAs the sun advances through the day, it will warm the city, reaching a comfortable 62 degrees, and the winds will provide a constant companion, inviting you to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket for the morning and a breezy top for the afternoon when the sun casts its glow. With such an inviting atmosphere, consider meandering through the vibrant streets, exploring local cafes, or seeking solace in one of the city\u2019s myriad parks, where the warmth of the sun dances with the cool essence of the coastal breeze. It\u2019s an ideal day to embrace the understated elegance of San Francisco, savoring the whispers of the wind and the laughter of its residents.",
