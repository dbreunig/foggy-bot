    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a gentle embrace of clouds lingers in the night, wrapping the city in a hushed, enigmatic shroud. The temperature will cradle you at a gentle 54, inviting shivers only from those unprepared for the wind whispering through the streets at 17 mph. When dawn breaks, the sun\u2019s presence will timidly assert itself, pushing away the lingering shadows. Yet as the day unfurls, expect the high to hover near a cool 60, before softly descending into the late afternoon\u2019s brisk embrace of 58. The winds, a lively mix of 15 to 28 mph gusts, will caper through the alleys, turning casual strolls into invigorating mini-adventures.\n\nThe skyline may wear a veil of mist, particularly around the Golden Gate, but the promise of clarity is afoot. Fog will oscillate around the edges \u2014 a reminder of the ocean\u2019s breath against the solidity of the city. One might find solace in a light jacket or a cozy sweater, ideal for layering against the playful winds. As the sun reaches its zenith, the park beckons, where a walk among tall trees offers a pause from the urban rhythm, or perhaps a gallery visit could serve as a gratifying refuge from the still-cool breeze. Whether you meander through the streets towards a quiet caf\u00e9 or simply find a sunlit bench to read, the day unfolds with a gentle grace, inviting you to indulge in its beauty.",
