Currently, the air is cool, around 50 degrees, with a gentle west wind brushing against the skin, carrying whispers of distant waves. As morning breaks, expect the overcast to lift, revealing glimpses of blue painted across the sky. By midday, the sun will shine brightly, illuminating the vibrant streets as temperatures rise to a comfortable 60 degrees. The west wind will pick up slightly, adding a refreshing zest to the atmosphere, ideal for a pleasant stroll through the city.\n\nThe morning is crisp, with hints of a marine layer clinging to the edges of the bay, but it won\u2019t linger long. By midday, you may notice the fog retreating, revealing the iconic skyline and the majestic Golden Gate, standing proud against the clarity of a sunlit day. Dress comfortably in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket to usher you through the cool morning, transitioning to a breathable shirt as the warmth of the day envelops you. With these conditions, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to enjoy a leisurely breakfast at a local caf\u00e9, savoring the scents of fresh brews.
