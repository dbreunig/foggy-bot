    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, tonight brings a gentle shroud of clouds, mingling softly with the evening air, as temperatures settle around a comfortable 54 degrees. A westerly breeze plays through the streets, lending a crisp touch to the charm of the city. As the sun rises tomorrow, the skies will brighten to reveal a mostly sunny day, with a high gently resting near 64 during the peak of the afternoon. Winds will continue, providing a vigorous backdrop as they dance at speeds up to 21 mph, adding a lively air to the waterfront atmosphere.\n\nAs evening transitions to morning, be prepared for that tantalizing bite of fog creeping in from the ocean, swirling softly around the Golden Gate; it may be wispy but is undeniably present. Given the temperatures and the chance of fog, a light jacket or sweater would serve well as you navigate this urban landscape. With such conditions, one might find joy in a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping for a warm drink as the day unfolds. Alternatively, a quiet visit to one of the local art galleries or cozy cafes could be the perfect way to embrace the day\u2019s calm and clarity.",
