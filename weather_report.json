    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle mist wafts in from the bay, heralding the promise of rain that drapes the city in a gauzy embrace. The air carries a crispness, a reminder of the fleeting warmth from the day, with temperatures dipping into the mid-fifties. Expect a mild southwest breeze, adding a whisper to the trees and a slight chill that brushes against the skin. Though the forecast hints at a mere 20% chance of rain, the lingering cloud cover suggests that the sky might still turn moody and reflective in the late night, perhaps gently moistening the pavements.\n\nAs Monday dawns, the slight chance for morning rain will linger before retreating into a mostly cloudy sky. Temperatures will hover near sixty, a tender reminder of spring's reluctance to fully embrace the warmth of summer. For those planning to venture out, light layers will serve well; a soft sweater wrapped beneath a light jacket will provide comfort against the maritime air. The day invites quiet pursuits\u2014perhaps a gentle stroll along the Embarcadero, watching the fog swirl around the boats as they bob serenely in the harbor, or a reflective moment with a book in one of the city\u2019s small caf\u00e9s, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with whispers of conversation. It\u2019s a day made for savoring the subtle beauty of this ever-changing skyline, catching the soft sheen of raindrops as they caress the windows of bustling shops and homes.",
