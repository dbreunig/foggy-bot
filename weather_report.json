    "weather_report": "As the sun wanes over Downtown San Francisco, an air of tranquility settles in, ushering in a night that promises to be partly cloudy with a gentle embrace of coolness, dipping to around fifty degrees. The southwest winds murmur softly at just a whisper, creating a pleasant backdrop for an evening stroll along the Embarcadero. The coastal fog that often blankets this iconic city appears to be lingering, hovering just beyond the bay, hinting at its characteristic dance as it plays hide and seek with the city's heights. Yet, for now, the skyline reveals itself, towers sharp against the fading light.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the forecast brings a canvas of mostly sunny skies, with temperatures inching toward the mid-sixties, falling gently as afternoon rolls in. This transition might tempt you outdoors\u2014perhaps to wander through the local markets or seek refuge in one of the city's cozy cafes, where one can savor a rich cup of coffee while observing the world pass by. Dress comfortably in layers: a light jacket or sweater should suffice for the cooler moments, ensuring you remain wrapped in a cocoon of warmth as the day unfolds. Today could be a brilliant day for a casual hike through Golden Gate Park, where whispers of the breeze among the trees will surely carry the promise of spring.",
