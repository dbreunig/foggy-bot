    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the atmosphere welcomes you with a gentle embrace of warmth and clarity, as the sun casts a golden hue over the iconic cityscape. With temperatures hovering around a comfortable 68 degrees, the air is fresh, tinged with the faint aroma of blooming flowers promising the advent of spring. A light breeze wafts in from the west-northwest, adding a soft whisper against one\u2019s cheek, making it an ideal moment for a leisurely stroll through the park or along the waterfront.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the skies remain predominantly sunny, with only the slightest hint of a marine layer lingering in the distance, gracefully retreating along the coastline. This means that the fog, while a familiar companion in San Francisco, is holding back today, allowing for unobstructed views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the sprawling city below. The evening promises to turn cooler as clouds drift in, settling to a low of around 51 degrees, so a light jacket or a cozy sweater is advisable for those venturing out later. In this inviting weather, spending time at a quaint caf\u00e9, perhaps enjoying a cup of fresh coffee while indulging in a good book, seems perfectly in tune with the rhythm of the day.",
