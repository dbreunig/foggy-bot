    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a mostly sunny sky, with a gentle warmth that beckons you outside. As the morning light spills across the city, temperatures hover near a comfortable sixty-four, gradually easing toward the early afternoon chills of sixty-two. The invigorating west wind, a familiar companion, sweeps through with the kind of grace that rustles leaves and teases hair, offering gusts that flirt with twenty-six miles per hour. \n\nAs the sun dips this evening into a partly cloudy embrace, the temperature will settle around fifty-six, urging a light jacket or sweater to ward off the chill that often creeps in with the dusk. The day promises an enjoyable blend of pleasant conditions\u2014ideal for a leisurely stroll through local parks or perhaps a visit to a favorite caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air. It's a simple time to take in the city\u2019s rhythm, whether meandering through the vibrant streets or finding solace in a quiet corner, all while reflecting on the beauty of a San Francisco day in summer.",
