    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the night, Downtown San Francisco rests under a cloak of clarity, the air crisp and serene, hinting at the gentle warmth to come. As dawn approaches, residents may notice a refreshing calm, punctuated only by the faint whispers of a southwest breeze. The low temperatures, lingering around the pleasant 59 degrees, beckon an ease\u2014ideal for light layers that can be shed as the day unfolds.\n\nCome Sunday, a splendid sunny disposition is set to envelop the city, inviting flourishes of warmth that will reach a comfortable 74 degrees. With the winds picking up strength, the soft touches of the breeze at 6 to 16 mph will be invigorating, perfectly countering the sun's embrace. While the marine layer has retreated, remnants of previous fog may linger near the coastline, painting the edges of the horizon with an ethereal touch. For those venturing outdoors, a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park or a quiet visit to the farmers market would seem particularly pleasant, as the promising weather strikes a delightful balance between warmth and a gentle maritime coolness, ensuring a day rife with possibilities.",
