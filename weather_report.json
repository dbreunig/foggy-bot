    "weather_report": "A gentle wisp of the seaside breeze ushers in another morning in Downtown San Francisco, encapsulated in a patchwork of clarity with a soft smattering of clouds overhead. The day arises bright and promising, offering a high of around 66 as the warmth of the sun teases its way through the mild air. The west-southwest winds are playful, exhibiting their strength with gusts that dance up to 25 mph, a reminder of the ocean\u2019s breath that often sweeps through these streets. As the afternoon approaches, temperatures will gently retreat to 64, inviting you to enjoy the embrace of light layers.\n\nTonight, the sky will don a cloak of partial clouds as the evening cools down to a restful 54. The wind will shift slightly, continuing to flit around, maintaining that refreshing edge characteristic of this coastal gem. Although fog will be fleeting, one may catch a glimpse of the marine layer flirting with the iconic bridge and hills\u2014 a quintessential San Francisco tableau. As you step outside, think of a light jacket or a cozy sweater, perfect for savoring a stroll along the waterfront or enjoying a quiet caf\u00e9 setting, where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with the crisp air. Today calls for discoveries of indulgent simplicity: perhaps an afternoon at a bookstore or lingering over a warm scone while watching the world glide by.",
