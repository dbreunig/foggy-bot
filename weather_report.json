    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a brilliant clarity, the sun casting a warm glow over the city's iconic skyline. The temperatures hover pleasantly around the mid-seventies, an invitation to venture outdoors. A gentle west-southwest breeze carries the fresh scent of the bay, weaving through the streets and softening the warmth. However, as the day meanders toward dusk, a veil of patchy clouds begins to drift in from the ocean, offering a hint of the evening\u2019s impending drizzle.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the temperature will dip into the cool embrace of the low sixties, beckoning you to dress in layers\u2014a light jacket over a soft sweater will serve you well, preparing you for the chill that creeps in after sunset. The serene backdrop makes this a perfect moment to explore the waterfront, where the whirr of activity blends with the soothing sounds of waves against the shore. As the sun sets, perhaps take a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or visit one of the nearby caf\u00e9s for a warm drink, savoring the transition of a vibrant city settling into its evening rhythm.",
