    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle veil of clouds clings to the skyline, a soft reminder of the extensive marine layer that often rolls in from the Pacific. The temperature sits comfortably around 61 degrees, offering a pleasantly cool embrace as the city shakes off the remnants of night. A light southwest breeze whispers through the streets, a herald of the mild warmth yet to come. As the day progresses, the sky will slowly shift, revealing glimpses of the sun, though the clouds will linger defiantly until late afternoon. \n\nThe forecast hints at a slight chance of rain arriving after 5 PM, so while the weather may not compel one to venture far into the expansive Bay, it allows for a stroll through the neighborhoods or perhaps a visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s where the warmth of a morning coffee can be savored. Dress in layers to accommodate the playful fluctuations of San Francisco\u2019s microclimates, segmenting between cool mornings and the possibility of a mild afternoon. For those poised to enjoy a leisurely day, the gentle allure of the local parks or a casual exploration of downtown\u2019s eclectic shops provides an easy respite from the unpredictability of the sky above.",
