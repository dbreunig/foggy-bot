    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the air carries the lingering coolness of the night, brushing lightly against the skin at around fifty-three degrees. Soft whispers of wind from the west rustle the leaves, their spirited gusts reminding us that the day will steadily grow brighter. Expect the sun to break through the cloud cover as it rises higher, ushering in a clear day. Though the high will reach a modest sixty-two, the temperature will dip slightly into the afternoon, painting the skyline with hues of gold as the crisp ocean air mingles with the warmth of summer.\n\nFor those awake and strolling through the streets this morning, it presents an ideal opportunity for a leisurely walk along the waterfront or through Golden Gate Park, where the gentle swell of residents enjoying a quiet morning can be felt. Comfortable layers are advisable: a light jacket or sweater will offer warmth against the cool winds. Engage in a moment of stillness\u2014perhaps a sip of coffee in a sunlit caf\u00e9, savoring the awakening city and the promise of a vibrant Independence Day ahead. The marine layer may linger at the edge of the bay, but with the sun\u2019s ascent, any fog is likely to dissipate, leaving a canvas wide open for discovery.",
