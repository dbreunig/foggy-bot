    "weather_report": "As the sun dips below the horizon, Downtown San Francisco finds itself cloaked in an ethereal dance of fog, the tendrils of which will soon embrace the city. Tonight\u2019s weather heralds a gentle mixture of partly cloudy skies and areas of fog that are likely to roll in after midnight, settling softly around 56 degrees. A brisk west-southwest wind whispers through the streets at 10 to 21 mph, offering a refreshing caress, its gusts adding an invigorating twist to the evening air.\n\nTomorrow promises a reprieve, gifting us with the light of dawn piercing through the fog. A beautiful morning will arise, giving way to a mostly sunny day that warms up to a pleasant high near 70. The temperatures will gently fall as afternoon approaches, inviting a gradual ease. Anticipating the light breeze, the best choice for dress would be layers that can be easily shed as warmth fills the air; perhaps a light sweater over a t-shirt. The day invites leisurely strolls along the waterfront or a quiet afternoon in one of the city's many parks, where the sun can be savored alongside a good book or engaging conversation.",
