    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle surf of moisture lingers in the air, hinting at the slight chance of drizzle that flitted through the morning. Nevertheless, the day has grown brighter, as the sun casts its warm gaze over a mostly sunny expanse, promising a high just shy of 64 degrees. A soft wind from the west-southwest dances playfully through the streets, a reminder of nature\u2019s rhythm, with gusts occasionally stirring the leaves and inviting a comforting chill. \n\nAs evening rolls in, an air of anticipation fills the atmosphere, bringing a whisper of drizzle after 2 AM. The night will be painted in shades of grey as clouds gather, wrapping the city like a warm blanket, with temperatures settling around a mild 56 degrees. Dress comfortably but wisely; layers are your allies today. A light jacket should suffice, perhaps complemented by a cozy scarf to shield against the evening breeze. The weather beckons you to explore, perhaps to wander along the waterfront, where distant views of the Golden Gate might be shrouded in mist, painting a scene of ethereal beauty, or to enjoy a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9 while watching the world go by in these tranquil, muted tones.",
