    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city greets the new day with a gentle clarity that promises a splendid Tuesday. The remnants of the marine layer have dissipated overnight, leaving a cool, refreshing atmosphere that hovers around the early morning chill of 48 degrees. As the sun rises, it casts its warm embrace upon the skyline, illuminating the iconic structures that define this vibrant metropolis. By midday, temperatures will hover near 60, gradually settling into a comfortable 57 by afternoon, while a light southwest breeze brings a subtle rustle to the leaves.\n\nToday's appeal lies in the soft sunshine and the gentle winds that whisper through the streets. With no hint of fog to obscure the sweeping views, it presents a perfect opportunity to venture out. A light jacket or sweater will suffice in the cool morning air, giving way to more relaxed attire as the day warms. Consider a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the shimmering bay beckons, or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many beautiful parks. Enjoy a coffee al fresco, or lose yourself in the pages of a good book, enveloped by the soothing sounds of this urban oasis. As you embrace the day, the charm of San Francisco unfolds quietly yet compellingly around you.",
