    "weather_report": "As the clock chimes ever so softly past midnight, a gentle tapestry of showers whispers across Downtown San Francisco, offering the possibility of rain before the dawn breaks. The air is cool, cloaked in the muted embrace of clouds that thrum softly against the iconic hills, setting a scene that feels intimate and contemplative. The winds swirl lightly, instilling an almost hushed tranquility that lingers on the skin, suggesting a light jacket may be a worthy companion for those venturing outdoors in the early hours. \n\nAs Friday unfolds, the clouds will part to reveal patches of sunlight spilling across the city like gold, casting a warm glow over the silvery waters of the Bay. Those golden rays will mingle intermittently with the cool breeze, drawing the temperatures down just a fraction. As you choose your attire for the day, think layers: a comfortably lightweight sweater to guard against the briskness of the wind, yet easily removable as warmth ensues. The mellow sun and the soft winds beckon you to enjoy a brisk walk along the waterfront, perhaps exploring hidden corners of the city or indulging in a leisurely coffee where you can soak in the easy rhythm of an evolving day; a day that feels more like a gentle promise than a command of busyness.",
