    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon beckons with a promise of warmth and clarity, the sun brightly illuminating the city's distinctive skyline. As the breeze flows in from the west, carrying with it hints of the ocean, temperatures gently sway near 70. The sky, unburdened by fog, offers expansive views, inviting city dwellers to bask in its brightness. This moment feels electric, where tranquility meets a whispering wind, suggesting a day well suited for a leisurely walk along the waterfront or perhaps sipping coffee at an open-air caf\u00e9, watching the world drift by under the benevolent sun.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the ambiance shifts softly, transitioning to a partly cloudy evening wrapped in the cool embrace of a low around 56. The wind will continue its gentle dance, encouraging layers that balance comfort against the evening chill. A light jacket or a cozy sweater would serve well, creating a perfect harmony of warmth as you explore the twinkling streets of the city. The allure of an evening stroll, framed by the settling dusk and the soft sounds of the metropolis, is the ideal way to embrace this beautiful San Francisco day.",
