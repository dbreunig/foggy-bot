    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle brightness enveloping the city, creating a mostly sunny canvas that radiates warmth through the delicate breeze. As the day inches towards 64 degrees, you may notice the temperatures easing back to a comforting 61 as the sun dips lower in the sky. The west wind whispers softly at 10 to 14 mph, punctuating the tranquility with occasional gusts, subtly invigorating the atmosphere. The scenery is marked by only the lightest hint of marine influence, as the coastal fog seems to linger at bay, preserving the gleaming skyline while casting a dreamy haze in the distance.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds will gather just a touch, offering a partly cloudy mood that hints at a cool embrace later tonight, settling around 49 degrees. With the continued gentle winds, a light jacket or layered clothing will greet you warmly as you wander the city streets. This serene setting invites casual pursuits: perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront to witness the sun's final curtain call, or a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink while the world tilts towards twilight. The day beckons you to take it easy, to lose yourself in simple moments that might reveal new delights in this vibrant yet gentle cityscape.",
