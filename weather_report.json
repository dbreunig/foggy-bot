    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon radiates warmth beneath a gentle sun, the kind that nudges a smile from passersby as breezes roll in from the west. With temperatures hovering near the mid-60s, the air feels fresh, mingling the scent of nearby ocean sprays with the earthy ambiance of urban life. While some coastal fog dances on the horizon, obscuring distant views of the Golden Gate, the immediate scene is surprisingly crisp, with visibility lending itself to gentle explorations of the city\u2019s charm. As evening draws closer, expect partly cloudy skies to weave through the twilight, offering a cozy backdrop for the winding down of the day.\n\nDress comfortably in layers to navigate this delicate transition, opting for light jackets or cardigans to embrace the coolness of nightfall without sacrificing ease during the warmer hours. The conditions present a lovely canvas for a leisurely walk along the waterfront, where one can take in the lingering golden hues of the sunset dipping over the bay, perhaps stopping at a quaint caf\u00e9 for a warm drink or a bite to eat while soaking in the serene beauty that San Francisco so generously provides.",
