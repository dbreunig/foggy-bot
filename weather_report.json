With the temperature hovering around the cool 51 degrees, the night is marked by a gentle breeze whispering through the streets, caressing the faces of those who venture outside. The marine layer has rolled in, shrouding iconic landmarks and creating a diffused glow from the city lights, lending an ethereal quality to the evening. \n\nTomorrow holds the promise of a more vibrant day, as the clouds part to reveal a mostly sunny vista. Anticipate a high near 61, though expect a subtle dip as afternoon approaches. It\u2019s wise to prepare with layers\u2014a light sweater or jacket for warmth against the lingering maritime chill, paired with comfortable shoes for a stroll through the nearby parks or a casual caf\u00e9 visit. The day may unfold in splashes of light and shadow, making it ideal for leisurely exploration, whether that be discovering a quaint bookshop or savoring a unique brew at a local coffee spot. As the evening advances, take a moment to observe the city as it basks in this peaceful transition, inviting the kind of quiet introspection that only an evening like this can inspire.",
