    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a crisp marine layer, softening the skyline and enveloping the city in a delicate veil of cloud. Presently, the atmosphere is mostly cloudy, with a whisper of a breeze that does little to disturb the calm. As the day progresses, temperatures will gently retreat from a high that lingers near a cool 61, settling around 57 by the afternoon, while a light south southwest wind adds a hint of chill, brushing softly against the skin. \n\nThis morning presents an ideal opportunity for a cozy stroll through one of the vibrant neighborhoods, where the scents of fresh coffee mingle with the crisp, salty air. One might consider layering up with a light jacket or sweater to ward off the coolness, perhaps accompanied by a sturdy pair of shoes to navigate the city's hilly terrain. The cloud cover, while draping a muted light over the landscape, also creates a perfect backdrop for those wishing to explore art galleries or quaint cafes, soaking in the local rhythm amidst the urban coolness. As evening descends, expect a continued embrace of the clouds, leading to temperatures dipping to 49, suggesting a warmer wrap for those venturing out after sundown.",
