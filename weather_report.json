The gentle breeze from the west southwest dances at speeds of 6 to 14 mph, occasionally rising to flirt with gusts of up to 18 mph, brushing past the iconic structures and winding streets, coaxing the shadows into playful movement.\n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, the city will awaken to partly sunny skies, with a high that rises to about 64 degrees, quietly fading to around 62 in the afternoon. The west southwest winds will continue their serenade, whispering through the neighborhoods at 5 to 14 mph and possibly reaching 21 mph in brief flurries. The marine layer, subtle yet persistent, will linger, casting a soft haze over the expanses of ocean and bay, dimming the brilliance of the sun\u2019s descent. \n\nTonight, as the cool air wraps around you, a light jacket will suffice, offering a comforting embrace against any lingering chill. Should you wish for a moment of solace, consider a stroll along the waterfront, where the rhythmic pulse of the waves meets the gentle hum of the city\u2014ideal for quiet reflection or shared conversation.
