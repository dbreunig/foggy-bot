    "weather_report": "As the early hours linger softly over Downtown San Francisco, the air dances between clarity and a playful veil of clouds. Tonight\u2019s temperatures tease at a mild 56, cradled by a gentle west-southwest breeze. A few errant clouds scatter overhead, casting fleeting shadows over the city\u2019s iconic skyline, which glimmers with the lights of restless night owls. As morning approaches, one might notice a gradual rise in temperature, hinting at avenues of warmth by dawn.\n\nFriday promises a cheerful embrace, draping the day in sunlit warmth with highs near a pleasant 67 degrees. The brisk west wind, flickering between 9 to 18 mph, might rustle around the corners of those who wander outside, yet it carries a freshness that enhances the day\u2019s character. Clear skies beckon invigorating pursuits, perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero or coffee on a sun-kissed terrace, where one can observe the city awaken and breathe. Dressing in layers would be wise; a light jacket or sweater for the early morning chill and perhaps a casual tee for the afternoon glow. The horizon, largely free of fog and the marine layer, offers an inviting backdrop for exploration. It is a day where the city sings with quiet promise, and there is little more to do than to simply enjoy the unfolding beauty around you.",
