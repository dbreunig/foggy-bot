    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, a delicate dance unfolds between sunshine and the remnants of the marine layer. As dawn breaks, a whisper of mist lingers in the air, hinting at a fleeting drizzle that has long since passed. The sun now casts its warm glow over the city, brushing the skyline with a gentle light that invites the day to unfold in calm serenity. The temperature, like the city's iconic hills, rises softly, reaching toward a comfortable 64 degrees, while a light breeze from the west sways the leaves and carries the coastal scent, reminding you that the ocean is never far away.\n\nFor those venturing outside, light layers are key\u2014perhaps a long-sleeved shirt to ward off any lingering chill, followed by a comfortable jacket that can be shed as the sun rises higher. As the afternoon wanes, the sky will remain predominantly clear, offering a splendid backdrop for strolls along the Embarcadero or a quiet moment in one of the city's lovely parks. Seek out a cozy caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating, relishing a warm brew while watching the world bustling by, or find a welcoming bench with a view of the Bay, perfect for a short escape from the pace of the day. With the winds twirling softly, today holds the promise of both peace and vibrant activity\u2014a canvas for whatever your heart desires as the day unfolds.",
