    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a muted beauty, as partly sunny skies offer brief moments of warmth, though an undertone of coolness remains palpable. The thermometer near that comforting mark of 63 degrees reflects a day that could easily sway to a cooler 60 as afternoon sets in, led by gentle winds drifting from the west. Despite the sun's efforts, a shroud of fog lingers in the distance, notably over the Golden Gate, with clouds weaving a delicate veil above the cityscape, hinting at a marine layer that clings closely to the shores. \n\nTonight, the skies will deepen into a quiet gray as temperatures dip to about 52; a tranquil backdrop fit for leisurely evening strolls along the Embarcadero or perhaps a cozy visit to your favorite caf\u00e9, warm beverage in hand to ward off the evening chill. Dressing in layers is a wise choice, with a light jacket or cardigan to keep the cool air at bay while allowing for the occasional glimpse of sunlight. Whether you find solace in reading at home or exploring the local galleries that await just below the urban canopy, there\u2019s a gentle rhythm to the day that beckons reflective moments and small, comforting pleasures.",
