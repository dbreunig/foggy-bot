    "weather_report": "As you navigate the brisk afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the sky looms heavy with low, swirling clouds, a foreboding presence that promises rain. The temperatures are teetering at a cool 57, soon to slip towards the mid-50s as gusts from the south-southwest dance energetically, boasting speeds that flirt with 36 mph. Umbrellas should take precedence in your plans, as an 90% chance of precipitation predicts a steady pour leading into a raucous evening of showers and the occasional thunderclap.\n\nThe atmosphere feels electric yet dismal, with the impending rainfall appearing to wash away the vibrancy of the day, concealed by a damp, heavy marine layer that hints at the melancholic beauty of mist-shrouded coastal towns. As dusk approaches, the forecast forebodes a drop to the chilly mid-40s, and so layers become essential: a warm jacket, perhaps even a beanie, with waterproof shoes to navigate the streets\u2019 inevitable puddles. And while the allure of staying indoors may tempt you, consider your options thoughtfully\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll through the nearby bookshop, pausing to savor a hot coffee or tea, or even seeking refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9 where the sound of rain becomes a gentle backdrop to the afternoon\u2019s unwinding.",
