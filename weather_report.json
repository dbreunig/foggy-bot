    "weather_report": "A gentle sun shines over Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, painting the city in warm hues as temperatures hover close to 70 degrees. The air, crisp and buoyant, carries whispers of coastal breezes, with winds curling from the west-southwest at a brisk pace. However, as the day unfolds, the warmth will softly yield to a cooler embrace, settling around 67 degrees, offering a tender reminder that the evening is on the horizon.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect the skies to morph into a canvas of muted tones, drizzles of patchy rain anticipated late into the night. Clouds will gather, crafting a cozy shroud that lowers temperatures to a mild 59 degrees. While the forecast suggests a mere 20% chance of precipitation, a light jacket may offer comfort against gentle gusts reaching up to 22 mph. The daylight, with its amiable clarity, invites you to take leisurely strolls along the waterfront or find solace in the vibrant energy of a downtown caf\u00e9, as a fleeting summer vibe lingers overhead, reminiscent of the golden days warming the city\u2019s heart.",
