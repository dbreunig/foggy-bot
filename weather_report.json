    "weather_report": "As the sun begins to hide beyond the hills, the gentle dance of clouds has turned the evening air into a cool, tranquil embrace for Downtown San Francisco. A hint of chill looms as the temperature drifts toward the projected low of 50 degrees. The west wind, whispering at a steady pace, carries with it the faintest scent of salt and sea, punctuated by occasional gusts that swirl through the streets with a playful intent. Tonight is one of those rare evenings where the sky, though partly cloudy, holds an understated beauty; under the fading light, the city holds its breath, wrapped in layers of muted hues.\n\nTomorrow brings a promise of a more vibrant palette, as the sun will reign over a mostly sunny day, ushering in warmth and brightness for the denizens of this coastal enclave. With highs lingering around 60 degrees, the seas will continue their rhythmic call. Dressing in layers would be wise, as the brisk winds may echo the essence of the evening chill, perfect for a stroll down Embarcadero or a leisurely coffee at one of the intimate cafes dotting the city. An afternoon exploring the parks, where the fresh air intermingles with the scent of blooming flora, could bestow a sense of serenity before the coolness of night falls again.",
