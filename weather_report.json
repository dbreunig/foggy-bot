    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is settling into a comfortable coolness, offering a reprieve under mostly clear skies. The gentle breeze, catching at six to fifteen miles per hour, lends a touch of liveliness as gusts rise to twenty-three miles per hour, swirling memories of the day gone by. The temperature dips to a serene 46, inviting a cozy layering of your favorite light sweater or perhaps a well-loved jacket for an evening out.\n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, a sunny disposition prevails, with the day promising warmth as the sun creeps to a high near 60. The northwest winds remain gentle, creating an ideal backdrop for a leisurely stroll or a relaxed picnic in one of the city's inviting parks. Given the clarity of this evening and the coming day, the absence of fog reveals the iconic silhouettes of landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge, an invitation for long walks along the waterfront. Opt for comfortable attire, perhaps with a picturesque scarf to complement your ensemble, as you explore the vibrant streets or settle into a quiet caf\u00e9 with a warm drink that echoes the simplicity and pleasure of being present in such a beautiful city.",
