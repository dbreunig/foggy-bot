    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle cloak of clouds drapes the city, their presence promising a serene atmosphere disturbed only by the whispers of a west-southwest wind. The temperature will softly dip to around fifty-two, inviting a light sweater or a jacket\u2014just enough to counter the coolness that accompanies the fading day. The wind, at times playful with gusts reaching up to twenty miles per hour, adds a refreshing urgency to the air, perfect for a stroll along the waterfront, where the sounds of the city seem to echo amidst a tranquil backdrop.\n\nThe optimistic forecast for Wednesday offers a striking contrast to tonight's muted hues. A radiant sun will replace the clouds, draping the city in warmth that will peak at around sixty-five degrees before mellowing to the comfortable embrace of sixty-two by afternoon. This gradual leap into brightness heralds a day ripe with potential. Picture yourself meandering through the Golden Gate Park or exploring the artsy nooks of the Mission District. With the wind\u2019s spirited dance between nine and twenty-three miles per hour, layering your outfit is essential\u2014perhaps a light shirt with a jacket for the afternoon, allowing for easy adjustments as the day unfolds. Amidst all this, the fog, a regular guest in these parts, retreats for a time, leaving an unobstructed canvas for both the sun and the curious souls that inhabit these streets.",
