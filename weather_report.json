    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the city is enshrouded in a gentle yet persistent rain, with clouds draping the skyline, stealing away any last remnants of sunlight. A cool breeze carries whispers of warmth against the chill, but with temperatures settling around the mid-forties, the air feels crisp. Visibilities may be reduced, awash in a veil of moisture; it is here the fog may creep in, lapping at the edges of iconic views, though its presence is subtle tonight.\n\nWith a night such as this, it seems fitting to embrace the cozy comforts of home. One might slide into a favorite sweater, perhaps a light waterproof jacket to fend off the drizzling rain for those who must venture out. On a day where the skies are unwilling to part, curling up with a good book or catching up on a series feels far more appealing than braving the weather. If you find yourself compelled to step outside, consider a leisurely stroll under an umbrella, delighting in the rhythmic patter of raindrops\u2014there is a soothing serenity to be found in the midst of the storm, a chance to reflect as the city dances in raindrops\u2019 glisten.",
