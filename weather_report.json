    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a brilliant afternoon unfolds, draped in sunshine that fills the streets with a soft, golden luminescence. The air is fresh, stirred gently by a light westerly breeze that invites exploration. Temperatures hover around a pleasant sixties, creating a perfect ambiance for strolls along the waterfront or leisurely afternoons at an outdoor caf\u00e9. As the day matures, high above, cottony cloud formations dance in a radiant blue sky, offering a sense of calm without the intrusion of fog that often blankets the city. \n\nAs night draws near, the promise of clear skies continues, ushering in cool temperatures that will settle around the mid-forties. A light jacket, possibly layered with a cozy sweater, will ensure comfort as twilight envelops the city. Given these delightful conditions, consider taking a walk through Golden Gate Park, where the vibrant greenery offers a serene escape, or perhaps indulge in a quiet evening at your favorite local bistro, savoring the simple pleasures of life under a starlit sky.",
