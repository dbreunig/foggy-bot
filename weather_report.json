    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a thick quilt of overcast skies, where the drama of rain paints a rather gray tableau. As the afternoon progresses, dark clouds weave themselves into a cloak of moisture, heralding a 100% chance of rain. The brisk south-southwest wind howls through the streets, creating a cacophony of whispers while rustling the trees and rattling umbrellas. In this damp embrace, temperatures linger around the upper 50s, gradually yielding to cooler air as the day wears on. \n\nAs evening descends, expect a symphony of rain showers coupled with the occasional thunderclap, evoking a sense of cozy introspection indoors. Tonight, with the thermometer dipping to the mid-40s, the scenery may be dreary, but it offers a chance for reflective moments, perhaps best enjoyed from a comfortably warm caf\u00e9 window with a good book or over shared stories with friends. Dress in layers\u2014warm socks, a sturdy coat, and a resilient umbrella will be your allies against the elements. The fog hangs low, wrapping the city in a gentle veil, quietly reminding you of the ever-present beauty even in moments of shadow.",
