    "weather_report": "Tonight settles over Downtown San Francisco like a well-worn blanket, the chill mixing with the dampness in the air as the sun relinquishes its hold. The low lies in the low fiftys, while a gentle east wind whispers, barely disturbing the stillness. As dusk drapes itself across the skyline, the promise of tomorrow looms\u2014clouds gather in anticipation, portending rain that may arrive mid-morning, likely sweeping through by lunchtime, bringing with it the percussion of showers and perhaps a rumble of thunder. The air will cool, hovering around the mid-fifties, wrapped in a curtain of gray.\n\nAs the day unfolds, one should dress thoughtfully to combat the persistent chill, layering is paramount. A sturdy, water-resistant jacket to fend off unexpected droplets and a soft scarf can provide comfort against the east wind. The scene may not promise the warmth of a sun-drenched afternoon, but opportunities abound for quiet contemplation with a steaming cup in hand at a local caf\u00e9 or the pleasure of meandering through the misty streets, where the familiar landmarks take on an air of mystery. In the afternoon, when the rain may wane, a brisk walk along the waterfront could be unobtrusively enlivening\u2014a chance to witness the dance of waves under the weight of a heavy sky, a serene reminder of nature's workings.",
