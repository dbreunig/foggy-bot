    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, a delightful clarity envelops the vibrant streets, with sunshine spilling over the city, illuminating its iconic hills and bustling corners. The warmth rises toward a mild 63 degrees, tempered by a gentle west-southwest breeze that whispers through the alleys, rustling leaves and stirring the spirits. While the day boasts a cheerful disposition, traces of fog still linger around the city's edges, hinting at the ocean\u2019s embrace. This soft marine layer will retreat further as the sun gains strength, leaving a playful dance of shadows against the skyline.\n\nAs night approaches, the atmosphere shifts, cloaked in a gauzy veil of clouds, settling around 52 degrees. A light wind will continue to tease your skin, so a light jacket or sweater would be prudent for an evening out. Consider wandering through the nearby parks or indulging in a local caf\u00e9, where the rich aroma of coffee and baked goods fills the air, making for an unpretentious escape. The beauty of San Francisco lies in its simple pleasures, and with the day transitioning to night, your wanderings will surely reward you with pleasant encounters and delightful moments to savor.",
