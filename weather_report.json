    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun spills over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the cityscape and creating an atmosphere of lightness and optimism. With temperatures reaching a comfortable 72 degrees, the air carries a gentle breeze from the west, offering a refreshing counterpoint to the sun\u2019s embrace. The sky, a brilliant blue, offers little evidence of the typical marine layer, aside from a whisper of fog clinging playfully to the shadows of the Golden Gate Bridge. As evening approaches, the skies remain mostly clear, promising a tranquil night with temperatures gently dropping to around 58 degrees.\n\nThis delightful afternoon invites residents and visitors alike to bask in the outdoors. A stroll along the waterfront or through the lush expanse of Golden Gate Park would be met with smiles and the soft rustle of leaves. Light layers serve as the ideal attire, accommodating the gradual evening chill while keeping one comfortable throughout the day\u2019s warmth. Whether sipping coffee at a favorite caf\u00e9 or simply enjoying the sights, today offers a splendid canvas for the everyday joys of city life, wrapped in the embrace of San Francisco\u2019s unique charm.",
