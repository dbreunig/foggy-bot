    "weather_report": "The sun hangs high over Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, casting a warm glow across the city with temperatures settling around 66 degrees. A light west wind dances through the streets, making the air feel fresh, while occasional gusts remind you of the city's dynamic character. The sky is a brilliant blue, free of the marine fog that often cloaks the Golden Gate. Instead, the views stretch out unimpeded, revealing the city's nooks and crannies, all edged by the distant hills.\n\nAs day transitions into evening, expect the clarity to persist, with mostly clear skies prevailing as night approaches. The temperature will gently dip to around 54, but a sweater or light jacket will serve you well against the cool breeze that will kick in. For those looking to embrace the evening, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, perhaps stopping to enjoy a quiet caf\u00e9 or to appreciate the city lights as they begin to twinkle in the dusk. The weather invites exploration and quiet contemplation, offering a pleasant respite from the bustle of life.",
