    "weather_report": "As night settles over Downtown San Francisco, the sky brushes lightly with clarity, a soft blanket of stars peeking through cooler air that hovers around 58 degrees. The southwest wind whispers gently, hinting at a night that will be welcoming to evening strolls, the kind where one might find solace in side streets illuminated by the glow of street lamps. In the morning light, the promise of a pleasant day unfolds, with sunshine expected to embrace the city as temperatures rise to a comfortable 74, dipping slightly by afternoon, but remaining amiable. \n\nWhile fog is a familiar companion in San Francisco\u2019s coastal realms, tonight it appears to reside in the more sheltered channels, likely creeping along the edges of the Golden Gate, perhaps invisible from the bustling urban core. Today\u2019s weather invites layers\u2014light sweaters to ward off the morning chill and perhaps a breathable jacket for the breeze that will playfully toss through the streets in the afternoon. With such inviting weather, one might find joy in a leisurely cycle along the waterfront, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to relish a warm cup while watching the world go by, or a gentle wander through the vibrant streets of the Mission, where murals come to life in the midday glow. The day holds a quiet elegance, perfect for savoring the simple pleasures of this enchanting city.",
