    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco is embraced by a gentle clarity, a promise of the bustling day ahead. As the city prepares to rise, the coolness of the night lingers with temperatures resting near 55 degrees, carried by a soft, whispering breeze from the southwest. While nightfall still blankets the streets, hints of sunlight are on the cusp of transforming the skyline into a palette of warm hues.\n\nCome Tuesday morning, the sun will reign, casting its light over the city as temperatures inch towards a comfortable 65 degrees, before settling in the afternoon around 61. Anticipate a light wind, spirited enough to rustle leaves and bring a refreshing touch, yet calm enough to allow for leisurely strolls through the neighborhood. The air will remain mostly clear, offering glimpses of the iconic Golden Gate, though hints of the marine layer may linger near the horizon, weaving imaginative figures into the early light. \n\nFor those embarking on the day's adventures, layering is key: a light sweater or jacket will provide comfort against the cool morning air, while a simple shirt will be more than sufficient when midday warmth descends. Whether it's a morning coffee at a local caf\u00e9, a stroll along the Embarcadero, or perhaps a visit to a hidden park, today invites a slow exploration of the city's nuanced charm, allowing the gentle embrace of San Francisco's weather to enhance the experience.",
