As the clock ticks towards the early evening, the temperature peaks around a pleasant 69 degrees, with a gentle breeze whispering down the avenues. The air carries a hint of calm, accented by the west-southwest winds that meander through the streets, stirring leaves and inviting locals to step outside for a stroll. \n\nYet, as twilight approaches, clouds gather quietly on the horizon, hinting at the possibility of rain later tonight\u2014an uncertain 40% chance looms after 8 PM. With dusk\u2019s arrival, the sky might cloak itself in a brooding marine layer, softening the vibrant daylight into muted tones. Optimal attire for this shifting weather includes layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket for warmth and light, easy footwear for an evening spent exploring the city\u2019s lesser-known paths. Consider a gentle amble along the Embarcadero or a caf\u00e9 stop to savor the aroma of fresh coffee, an engaging book in hand, all while anticipating the gentle patter of a nighttime drizzle that may wash the city anew.",
