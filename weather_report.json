    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco carries a quilt of muted grays, as the sky dons a mostly cloudy ensemble, with occasional hints of softness peeking through the thick, lingering cloud cover. With temperatures gently oscillating around the low 60s, there\u2019s a crispness in the air, signaling that while the day is not unbearably cold, a light layer might offer comfort against the chill. The West wind whispers softly at six mph, adding a touch of movement to the scene but not enough to disturb the fog that often greets our shores at this hour. \n\nAs night approaches, patches of fog will weave their way into the landscape, embracing the city in a soft embrace, creating an ethereal atmosphere. Underneath the clouds, temperatures will drift down to about 53, inviting cozy attire\u2014think a light sweater or jacket to harmonize with the mild yet brisk fabric of the evening air. This weather calls for leisurely strolls through quiet streets, perhaps stopping by a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink to sip while watching the world meander by in a languid rhythm. Given the fluidity of the day and time, engaging in conversation with friends over shared plates or catching an understated gallery opening are quietly inviting ways to enjoy this cloaked urban evening.",
