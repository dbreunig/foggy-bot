    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night has yielded to a partly cloudy dawn, casting a soft veil over the city. With a gentle low settling around 54 degrees, the air feels cool yet inviting, a whisper of the warmth that the day promises. As the sun stretches its golden rays across the skyline, it will coax temperatures up to a comfortable 69, before easing into a warmer 66 by the afternoon. A light southwest breeze dances through the streets, barely ruffling the leaves but just enough to remind us of nature\u2019s hand at play.\n\nThe hints of fog that often embrace this city are reluctantly present; they linger at the fringes, teasing the defining landmarks but not smothering them. Visibility is heightened, inviting wanderers to explore the contours of the city with clarity. Dressing in layers will be most prudent\u2014perhaps a light sweater for the early hours and a breezy shirt for the afternoon. The allure of a stroll down to the waterfront beckons, where one might enjoy the juxtaposition of lively caf\u00e9 chatter and the gentle lapping of waves against the shore. Alternatively, a leisurely morning in one of the area\u2019s many vibrant parks might offer the perfect reprieve, allowing the day to unfold serenely.",
