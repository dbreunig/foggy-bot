    "weather_report": "As the night casts a heavy, damp blanket over Downtown San Francisco, the streets are cloaked in rain, painting a picture of a somber yet introspective evening. A chill lingers in the air, with the temperature dipping to a cool embrace around fifty degrees. This is not the sort of night that invites outdoor celebrations; rather, it beckons the warmth of home and the comfort of soft blankets. The rain dances steadily, bringing with it a drenched rhythm, a perfect accompaniment to steaming cups of tea or the comforting aroma of homemade soup. \n\nTomorrow, on Washington's Birthday, the skies will remain overcast, with rain continuing to fall, caressing rooftops and sidewalks alike. Highs will barely peek above fifty, as the wind whispers secrets through the streets, gusting up to twenty-three miles per hour. It's a day for hunkering down, perhaps curled up with a compelling novel or enjoying a local caf\u00e9, where the warmth of the interior contrasts sharply with the chill outside. As you plan your wardrobe, think layers\u2014perhaps a well-loved raincoat, sturdy shoes, and a cozy scarf to ward off the cool breaths of the city. Embrace the downpour and let it remind you that even on the darkest days, there is beauty in the stillness and a story waiting to be told.",
