    "weather_report": "As the night blankets the city, San Francisco sits under a shroud of moisture, the air laden with the promise of rain that will sweep through overnight. The clouds, thick and determined, mirror the coolness that clings to the streets, hinting at the dampness that arrives with morning. Low temperatures nestle around fifty, encouraged by a gentle west-southwest wind that rustles through the trees and dances through the alleys, whispering of impending showers that will punctuate the day.\n\nTuesday dawns gray and tumultuous, with rain trickling down before the sun has fully risen. The sky will continue to deliver its watery offerings, spilling into brief but spirited thunderstorms between the hours of eight and two. Through it all, a high near fifty-six teases the possibility of warmth that rarely comes, obscured by clouds and gusts up to twenty-nine miles per hour, reminiscent of a playful but unyielding spirit. Fog may linger along the edges, softening the outlines of the city\u2019s skyline, especially around the hallowed grounds of the Golden Gate, while the marine layer hugs the coast, ghostlike and ethereal.\n\nFor those venturing beyond the warmth of home, practicality reigns supreme. A sturdy jacket paired with waterproof footwear will lend comfort against the chill and dampness that seeks to envelop the day. It\u2019s a moment for cozy caf\u00e9s, where the murmur of conversation mingles with the aromatic embrace of freshly brewed coffee. Perhaps a stroll through the Mission District, with its vibrant murals brightening the drizzly atmosphere, will invite a sense of discovery, or wandering the halls of a museum, oblivious to the weather outside. Such moments remind us of life\u2019s pulse, vibrant even in the grayest skies.",
