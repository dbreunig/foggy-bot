    "weather_report": "As dawn unveils its muted light over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is steeped in a delicate yet persistent veil of rain, accompanied by patchy fog that softly blankets the hills. The high clouds hang low, casting a shadow over the city as they drift toward the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge and beyond. With temperatures hovering close to a chilly 56 degrees and a gusty breeze whipping through at times, the day presents a tapestry of moisture and movement. A mix of clouds and fog mingles, offering an environment that feels both brooding and alive. \n\nFor those daring to step outside, a light raincoat or layered attire would be wise; the winds could shift suddenly from a gentle whisper to a brisk gust. Embracing the weather might lead one to enjoy a quiet stroll through a local coffee shop, savoring the comfort of a warm beverage while watching the rhythm of city life flicker in and out through the mist. Alternatively, the embrace of an art gallery could provide a respite from the afternoon dampness, allowing for reflection amidst the muted colors and textures that resonate with the day\u2019s gray tones.",
