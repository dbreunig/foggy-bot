    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco stands under a moody, shifted sky, where hazy clouds blend with the gritty urban landscape, giving both a gentle curtain and a hint of chill. The afternoon light is tentative, revealing a high that hovers around the unassuming mark of sixty degrees. A light breeze from the southwest dances through the streets, weaving an air of change as rain begins to beckon like a distant friend, its arrival predicted post-11 PM. The current ambience is one of fleeting sunshine interrupted by patches of cloud, offering a serene yet slightly melancholic atmosphere.\n\nAs evening creeps in, the likelihood of rain picks up, with tendrils of moisture threading through the dimming light. The air is crisp, and a light jacket or a soft sweater may offer comfort as the temperature gently slips into the fifties. Perhaps it's a fitting evening for a bookshop visit or a quiet corner caf\u00e9, where one might linger over a warm drink, listening to the world sizzle and hum with the promise of rain. This is the sort of day where staying close to home feels just right, a gentle reminder to savor the solace that such weather can bring.",
