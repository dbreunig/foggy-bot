    "weather_report": "The morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, wrapped in a shroud of clouds that hint at the night's lingering embrace. As the city stirs awake, those soft, warm whispers of early warmth have settled to a cool, comfortable 53 degrees. The familiar westerly breeze meanders through the streets at a gentle pace, a precursor to a brighter day ahead. Memorial Day promises to gift the city a canvas of sunny skies, with ambitious rays aiming to peek through and warm the air to a modest 62 degrees.\n\nYet, the conditions this morning have a slightly muted character; the fog may play coy along the coastline, casting a blanket over the Golden Gate and cradling buildings in a gentle haze. While the clouds disperse through the day, one might still find the shadows of the marine layer lingering about, an invitation for a light jacket or cardigan until the sun rises high enough to banish the chills. \n\nIn this delicate balance of warmth and coolness, the day beckons one towards leisurely pursuits\u2014perhaps a quiet stroll through the Presidio, where the paths wind and whisper stories of the past, or a slow sip of coffee at a local caf\u00e9, the comforting notes of companionship rising with the fragrant steam. For those seeking a splash of adventure, a bike ride along the Embarcadero can be delightful, as the city transitions into its sunlit self, the promise of blue skies just beyond the horizon.",
