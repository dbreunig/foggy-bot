    "weather_report": "As the clock strikes one in the stillness of the night, a light veil of clouds drifts across Downtown San Francisco, wrapping the city in a gentle embrace. The air, cool and crisp at around 47 degrees, carries a whisper of west-southwest winds barely stirring at 2 mph. The morning promises to shed its nocturnal shroud, unfolding into a canvas painted with the gentle hues of early sunlight. By midday, temperatures will rise to a comfortable 63, dipping slightly to 59 as the sun laps at the horizon, signaling the onset of afternoon.\n\nWith the allure of the day ahead, one might find it quite pleasant to venture outdoors. Though there\u2019s a hint of fog lingering close to the coast, straddling the edges of the iconic Golden Gate, it will gradually give way to more clarity as the sun asserts its presence. Dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket to fend off the lingering chill in the early hours, transitioning to a simple t-shirt as the warmth of midday settles in. Given the clarity that will soon embrace the skyline, it\u2019s an opportune moment for a stroll along the waterfront or an unhurried visit to the local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh pastries beckons, a perfect companion to the awakening day.",
