    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco rests under a canopy of clarity, the chill of the night still lingering as temperatures drift down toward 47. The North wind, gentle and unobtrusive, whispers through the streets, promising a transition from the cool calm of night to the sun\u2019s embrace at daybreak. As morning unfolds, the sun will rise to illuminate the city in warmth, reaching a high near 60, a modest warmth tempered by afternoon breezes that shift the temperature back towards 58.\n\nThe coastal fog, a familiar companion in this region, seems to have retreated for now, its presence evanescent, leaving the skyline unobscured and inviting. This day is marked by possibility, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or exploring the murals and vibrant culture of the Mission District. A light jacket will suffice as you venture out, guarding against the chill without confining the spirit of the day. Those seeking connection can decamp to a local caf\u00e9, indulging in a steaming cup while basking in the warmth of morning light. The world stirs awake, and so too should you, embracing a day that promises to be gentle, bright, and refreshingly clear.",
