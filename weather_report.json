    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches Downtown San Francisco, a gentle whisper of clarity envelops the city, heralding a sunny Friday. Currently, the air holds a crispness that speaks of a low that dips gracefully into the night. While darkness still lingers, the promise of warmth lies just beyond the horizon, with the sun preparing to illuminate streets and landmarks alike as the day matures. The morning is devoid of fog, a welcome rarity in this coastal enclave, allowing for an unobstructed view toward the grandeur of the Golden Gate and beyond.\n\nBy mid-morning, expect the warmth to weave through the urban landscape, as temperatures edge toward a comfortable 65 degrees while cooling slightly in the afternoon. A light north wind may kiss your skin, subtly enhancing the day\u2019s charm. For those venturing out, a light jacket or sweater will be your ally in the early hours, fading into a simple T-shirt or breathy blouse as the sun climbs higher. As the day unfolds, a stroll along the waterfront might beckon\u2014perhaps a tranquil seat at a local caf\u00e9, where the sounds of life and the gentle lapping of the bay blend harmoniously. This day is one marked by pleasant uneventfulness, urging leisurely exploration rather than frantic endeavors.",
