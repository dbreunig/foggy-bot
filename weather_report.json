    "weather_report": "The afternoon light pours over Downtown San Francisco, illuminating the city with a gentle brightness. The sun hangs high, casting a pleasant glow as temperatures hover around 61 degrees, before dipping slightly as the day progresses. Whispers of wind ripple through the streets, with gusts reaching upwards of 31 mph, offering a briskness that invigorates rather than chills. While the immediate view may boast clarity, the horizon hints at a soft marine layer, gently kissing the tips of the Golden Gate Bridge and enveloping the bay in a light embrace, a seasonal signature of this coastal city.\n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will transform into a tableau of partly cloudy vistas, settling to a comfortable 52 degrees. For those venturing out, light layers will serve well\u2014perhaps a stylish cardigan or a light jacket paired with comfortable shoes, perfect for meandering along the Embarcadero or seeking refuge in a quaint caf\u00e9. The city beckons, inviting wanderers not to the well-trodden paths, but to the hidden corners\u2014places where the air is filled with the aromas of local foods, or where spontaneous conversations illuminate the heart of the day. It\u2019s an elegant canvas of pastels and possibilities, waiting for you to step into its narrative.",
