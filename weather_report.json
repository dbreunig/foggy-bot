    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon presents a tapestry of mostly cloudy skies, a muted gray palette brushing the buildings, with the high temperature lingering around 58 degrees before gently descending to about 56. The west wind carries a light breath of chill, whispering through the streets as anticipation hangs in the air\u2014soon, the clouds will thicken, hinting at the impending rain later tonight. Expect a significant shift after 11 PM, as the sea's moisture cloaks the city, creating a cozy embrace of humidity that will settle around 49 degrees, accompanied by gusts that dance up to 23 mph.\n\nAs the day unfolds, one might find the atmosphere less than invigorating, perhaps leaning toward the dreary side of pleasant. The distinctive fog that often graces San Francisco might not be immediately evident, but the marine layer looms closely, promising its arrival with evening rain. For those venturing out, warm layers are advisable; a light jacket will ward off the coolness, particularly as the evening draws near and the rain begins to fall. This is an ideal time to explore the city\u2019s cozy cafes or indulge in a quiet evening at home, perhaps wrapped in a good book or a favorite film as the raindrops begin their soft percussion on the windows.",
