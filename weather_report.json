    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds under a quiet, mostly sunny sky, though hints of the cool marine layer linger nearby. The breeze carries a touch of freshness, with gusts that remind one of the ocean's presence just beyond the hills. As the day progresses, temperatures will settle comfortably near 65, giving way to a gentle decline as afternoon approaches. Clouds will roll in, softening the edges of the skyline, but it is far from an oppressive gloom; rather, it frames the day with a subtle elegance.\n\nGiven the early hour and pleasant temperatures, it\u2019s a splendid time for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a cozy coffee meeting at one of the local caf\u00e9s, where the aroma of freshly brewed beans mingles with the brisk air. Layering is advisable\u2014perhaps a light sweater or jacket to guard against the afternoon's chill, especially as the sun dips behind the clouds later. Embrace the day\u2019s understated charm, with the ever-changing hues of the bay transforming the landscape into a canvas of muted pastels as you navigate the city with a sense of exploration and ease.",
