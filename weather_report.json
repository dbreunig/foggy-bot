    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the atmosphere dances between sunlit optimism and the ever-present hint of the coastal marine layer. With a current high settling around 66 degrees, the warmth is gently tempered by a brisk breeze from the west, nudging temperatures down to a comfortable 64 as midday approaches. The skies above are mostly sunny, yet a subtle layering of clouds whispers of the cool fog that often rolls in off the bay, offering a refreshing embrace to the city's iconic landmarks. \n\nAs evening descends, expect a shift to mostly cloudy skies, where the temperature will gracefully dip to a mild 57. For those venturing outdoors, layered clothing will serve you well; a light jacket will shield against the cooler winds while still allowing for the day's sun-kissed warmth. A stroll through the Presidio, framed by the muted charm of foggy vistas, or perhaps a quiet moment at one of the lively local caf\u00e9s, would complement the day's serene ambiance beautifully, inviting a sense of calm amidst the urban rhythms.",
