    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco welcomes a gentle embrace of sunshine, with the air crisp and invigorating. A high near 66 degrees gracefully settles in, only to dip slightly as the day rolls into its later hours, creating a comfortable environment for leisurely strolls or caf\u00e9 visits. The west-southwest winds, dancing between 8 and 14 mph with playful gusts, offer a refreshing touch, enhanced by the clear skies revealing a striking view toward the Golden Gate Bridge and the bustling heart of the city. \n\nAs twilight beckons, the warmth of the day will give way to a comfortable evening, settling around 53 degrees under mostly clear skies. With such pleasant weather, one might effortlessly slip into a light sweater if venturing outside. Tonight holds promise for peaceful gatherings under the stars, perhaps at a local park or dinner by the waterfront, as the gentle breeze invites relaxation and conversation. The absence of fog allows the city\u2019s vibrant colors to shine through, providing an inviting backdrop for any activity.",
