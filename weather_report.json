    "weather_report": "The dawn over Downtown San Francisco greets the day with a gentle clarity that promises the delight of a mostly sunny afternoon. As the sun rises, its rays illuminate the textured skyline, casting long shadows that dance along the city\u2019s undulating streets. The forecast suggests a high near 74, a comfortable embrace for early autumn, where the golden warmth will gradually surrender to cooler breezes by afternoon. A southwest wind whispers through the streets, occasionally picking up strength, dancing playfully between buildings and rustling through the leaves of nearby trees.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the delightful sun will find itself increasingly veiled by a light layer of clouds, hinting at the gentle transition toward evening. Tonight, expect the cool caress of a west southwest wind, heralding a low of around 57, perfect for a cozy evening under a soft blanket or perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront where the rhythmic sounds of waves provide a soothing backdrop. Given the day\u2019s pleasantness, consider slipping into lightweight layers, a breathable shirt complemented by a light jacket for after the sun dips below the horizon. It\u2019s a day ripe for a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with the soft chatter of city dwellers, or perhaps to dip into a quiet corner bookstore, where time drifts lazily like a passing cloud.",
