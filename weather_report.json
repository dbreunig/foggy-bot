The horizon glows softly, hinting at the warmth to come\u2014though for now, the atmosphere is a mix of coolness and clarity, with the remnants of yesterday's fog reluctantly departing. The forecast promises a mostly sunny day, temperatures easing into the low sixties, providing an inviting backdrop for leisurely exploration.\n\nMorning strolls along the waterfront might reveal a touch of marine layer still clinging to the edges, where the ocean meets the land, but as the sun ascends, it will gradually dissipate. Dressing in layers is sensible: perhaps a light jacket in the morning, cast aside as the day warms against the skin. A brisk walk through the city's streets, perhaps a visit to a caf\u00e9 for a hazelnut latte or fresh-baked scone, could perfectly match this serene atmosphere. Later, as the sun begins to mellow, the inviting light may inspire an afternoon spent in Golden Gate Park, where the paths invite wandering and discovery, making for a day both rejuvenating and rich in small pleasures.",
