The clouds, mostly opaque yet unassuming, cradle the city in their embrace, casting a gentle veil over the streets. Temperatures hover around a moderate 57 degrees, accompanied by a brisk wind from the west\u2014an insistence of 13 to 21 miles per hour that whispers through the alleyways and fills the night with a cool aliveness. The forecast hints at a 20% chance of precipitation, suggesting that one should not venture too far without an umbrella tucked into a light jacket.\n\nTomorrow promises a glimmer of sun breaking through the overcast, coaxing the mercury upward to a comfortable 66 degrees before retreating slightly by afternoon. For the early risers, a slight chance of drizzle persists until the sun fully claims its domain, hinting at a morning that is at once refreshing and slightly damp. The clarity of the day is anticipated to improve, transforming the familiar scenes of the city into a tableau of colors and movement, inviting long walks along the Embarcadero or perhaps a cozy caf\u00e9 to sip coffee while watching the world flicker to life. Given the conditions, layering remains the wise course of action\u2014a light sweater or jacket accommodates both the shifting warm and cool moments of the day. \n\nFinding joy in the simple pleasures is always an option, with opportunities for leisurely strolls through the parks or a visit to local shops, celebrating the living heartbeat of this city by the bay\u2014a city unafraid of the fog that occasionally drapes a mysterious mantle over its beauty.",
