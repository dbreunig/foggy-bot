    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds with bright sunshine, a gentle warmth enveloping the city as the temperature hovers around a comfortable 63 degrees. A west-southwest breeze dances through the streets, adding a hint of invigorating chill to the air, making it a moment to savor. The lack of fog allows for sweeping views of the city, presenting a clear tableau of urban life against a canvas of blue sky. As twilight approaches, clouds will softly quilt the horizon, trailing off into the cool embrace of the evening, where temperatures will settle around 56.\n\nDress lightly but keep a layer handy \u2014 perhaps a light jacket or a cozy cardigan, especially as the wind begins to pick up. The weather invites a stroll through the Mission District, where vibrant murals and rich aromas from local eateries beckon. Alternatively, a quiet afternoon at one of the many parks can be equally delightful, where you may find solace in nature and a good book. As the sun dips and the city lights begin to twinkle, an evening walk along the Embarcadero promises the unhurried pleasure of gentle sea breezes and a vibrant ambiance.",
