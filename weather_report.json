    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this morning, a gentle brightness begins to lift the veil of night, though the city's character remains lightly draped in a subtle mist, hinting at the soft embrace of patchy fog. The air is cool and crisp with temperatures that flirt with the low sixties. As the day unfolds, expect the sun to break through intermittently, casting a warm glow before the afternoon breeze nudges temperatures back towards a cooler ambiance. The winds are calm, a whisper of movement, barely stirring the leaves along the sidewalks.\n\nAs night approaches, the promise of the fog will return, veiling the city between three and five o\u2019clock in the morning, adding an ethereal quality to the skyline. With the current conditions leaning towards pleasant, one might slip into a light jacket or a cozy sweater\u2014ideal for a stroll along the Embarcadero or a quiet coffee in one of the charming local cafes. Consider visiting Golden Gate Park for a serene walk, where the natural beauty can be enjoyed without the throng, or perhaps a leisurely read in one of its secluded nooks. Embrace the day with a sense of ease, letting the rhythm of the city serenade you through this tranquil morning.",
