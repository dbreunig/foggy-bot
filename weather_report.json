    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds beneath a mostly sunny sky, inviting the world to come alive under its gentle embrace. The temperature is comfortably nudging near 68 degrees, but as the sun gradually rises higher, it will settle closer to a cooler 66 later in the day. With a soft southwest breeze meandering between 2 to 10 miles per hour, there's a whisper of warmth in the air, urging you to savor a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city's lush parks. \n\nAs night approaches, expect the skies to clear, ushering in a low of around 51 degrees. The west-southwest wind might still linger, perfect for a light jacket or a cozy sweater. It's a day that promises a medley of simple pleasures\u2014maybe sipping a locally crafted coffee outside while watching the world pass or exploring a new corner of the city that you've yet to uncover. Given the clarity and warmth of the day, it\u2019s an ideal time for unhurried explorations, perhaps cross over to the Ferry Building Marketplace for a bite, allowing the vibrant energy of San Francisco to wash over you amidst the golden light.",
