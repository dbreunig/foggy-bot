The forecast betrays a promising morning, marked by a veil of mostly sunny skies\u2014a fleeting comfort now gives way to a more somber palette, with clouds beginning to thicken like whispers of a changing mood. The temperature, softly nestled around 60 degrees, suggests a brisk yet manageable chill in the breeze, as the west-southwest wind nudges softly between 8 to 12 mph, carrying with it the distinct scent of coastal salt.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds will linger, ushering in cooler tones and a low settling into the mid-50s. The pervasive marine layer that haunts the edges of the bay brings a hint of fog, painting the Golden Gate Bridge in an ethereal shroud. This quiet obscurity may dim the vitality of the cityscape, yet it also invites the warmth of shared moments indoors. In light of such atmospheric temperament, one might slip into layers\u2014a light sweater over a shirt, perhaps a comfortable pair of shoes for wandering through the less-trodden paths. Seek refuge in a quaint caf\u00e9, a hidden bookstore, or simply wander beneath the city\u2019s iconic archways, embracing the serene companionship of the foggy embrace.",
