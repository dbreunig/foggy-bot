    "weather_report": "As the night slips quietly from Downtown San Francisco, the air is crisp and mostly clear, a gentle reminder that spring\u2019s embrace is still upon us. The temperature rests comfortably around 51 degrees, inviting a light layer for those venturing into the early morning. The west-southwest wind, a playful whisper at nine miles per hour, stirs the leaves yet leaves the skies unobstructed.\n\nAs dawn approaches, a sunny disposition unfurls, promising a high of 66 degrees for the day ahead. There\u2019s an invigorating west wind that may breeze in at times, intensifying to 22 miles per hour. While the fog may find its way in from the ocean later, this morning hints at clarity, with most of the city bathed in golden sunlight\u2014perfect for a stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely cup of coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, relishing the life of the city waking up. It\u2019s a day for layers: think light, breathable fabrics to bask in the warmth, yet keeping a warmer outer layer close for the afternoon's breezes as the sun traverses higher in the sky. Move through the streets with a sense of ease and purpose; discover the lesser-known nooks that make this vibrant city breathe.",
