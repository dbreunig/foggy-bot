    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle chill lingers in the air. The forecast hints at a slight drizzle later in the night, blending with the clouds that gather overhead like a cozy blanket. The temperature dances around a mild 57 degrees, and the wind whistles softly from the west-southwest, adding a brisk edge to the evening's calm. The city looks somewhat muted under the diffuse light, the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge peeking through as the fog begins its slow embrace.\n\nFor tomorrow, the sun promises to break free, transforming the city into a bastion of warmth, albeit tempered by the ever-present marine layer. Expect a high near 66, giving way to a cooler afternoon that whispers, \"Stay close to a light jacket.\" The breeze, though not overpowering, will be enough to remind you of the Bay's charm. For a delightful day ahead, consider a stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9 where you can unwind and enjoy the unfolding landscape with a warm cup in hand.",
