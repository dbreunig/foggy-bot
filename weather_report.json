    "weather_report": "As ample clouds drift above downtown San Francisco, a veil of moody gray sets the tone for the day. A gentle but persistent breeze carries the scent of impending rain, teasing the air with the promise of moisture as drops begin to hint at their arrival. The cityscape is partially obscured, the golden rays of sun struggling to penetrate the thickening atmosphere, while the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge stands in quiet contrast, asserting its presence through the wisps of fog that cling lovingly to its towers.\n\nWith the thermometer hovering near a cool 59, today feels like an invitation to bundle up, perhaps in a light waterproof jacket, paired with a scarf for that extra warmth as the winds whip at speeds that could curl your hair and chill your bones. As the day wears on, the chance of rain transforms from mere possibility into a certainty, and the streets beckon for solace indoors\u2014perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the steam from a fresh cup of coffee dances to your heart\u2019s rhythm, or a spot by the window to indulge in the literary arts. Outdoor endeavors would best be suited for brief escapes amid the clouds; a walk to embrace the brisk air may invigorate, but prepare to duck indoors or seek shelter as the evening settles in with a flavorful promise of rain that lingers through the night.",
