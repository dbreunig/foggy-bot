A light north wind whispers through the city, hinting at the chill that lingers\u2014 a gentle reminder to have a sweater close at hand. \n\nAs dawn approaches, the clouds will begin to part, revealing moments of sunshine that will flirt with the edges of the skyline. The day's high will likely reach around 65 degrees, but don\u2019t expect the warmth to linger, as afternoon temperatures may retreat to a cooler 60. Winds shifting to the south-southwest will bring with them a feeling of fresh possibility, although they won't be strong enough to disturb the calm of this early spring day. Given the softness of the morning light and the potential for fog\u2019s embrace along the Golden Gate, it\u2019s best to carry a light jacket or scarf for your strolls along the waterfront or through the city's inviting parks. It\u2019s a day suited not for grand explorations, but for simple pleasures\u2014perhaps savoring a quiet moment in one of the local caf\u00e9s with a warm cup of coffee, or watching the world wake as you meander along the bayside paths, where the gentle lapping of waves meets the soft rustle of urban life.",
