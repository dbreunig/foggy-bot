    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, an inviting warmth bathes the city, painting the surroundings in hues of vibrant blue. The day is graced with sunshine, gently accentuating the contours of the cityscape under a high near 74 degrees. Light gusts of wind, dancing in from the west southwest, add a subtle energizing chill, creating a delightful interplay of warmth and coolness ideal for leisurely outdoor pursuits.\n\nTonight, the clarity of the sky will give way to a peaceful ambiance, with the temperature dipping to a comfortable 58 degrees under a mostly clear expanse. As the sun sets, the air, kissed by the ocean, promises a serene evening, ideal for a relaxed stroll through Fort Mason or an open-air dinner in North Beach. With such pleasant conditions, a light jacket or sweater could be a wise companion for later, ensuring comfort as the breeze picks up. The lack of fog enhances the allure of the view; the marine layer has receded, leaving the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and the shimmering bay in clear sight. This splendid day is a gentle reminder of the city's beauty, inviting moments of reflection and leisurely exploration.",
