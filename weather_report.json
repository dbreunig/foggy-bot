    "weather_report": "As the evening envelops Downtown San Francisco, a soft blanket of cloudiness settles over the city like an old friend. The temperature hovers around the mid-fifties, a cool embrace that suggests perhaps a light jacket or a cozy sweater might be ideal to stave off the chill. A slight chance of drizzle looms, occurring mostly after two in the morning, but for now, the city stands quietly in anticipation, its people pleasantly caught between dusk and the comfort of home. \n\nLooking toward Tuesday, the promise of a mostly sunny day awaits, but with a temperament that may shift as the afternoon beckons. Highs will graze the low sixties, perhaps inching downward as the warmth of the sun begins to recede. Wisps of fog may play at the edges of the Golden Gate, hinting at the omnipresent marine layer that often dances through the bay. As you prepare for the day ahead, consider donning layers that allow for adaptability\u2014easy to shed as the sun emerges and a soft scarf for evenings where the winds flirt with a chill once more. Given the weather, it\u2019s an opportune moment for a leisurely stroll through a nearby park, where the beauty of nature juxtaposes gracefully with urban life, or perhaps a quiet gathering at your favorite caf\u00e9, sipping a warm drink while watching life unfurl outside.",
