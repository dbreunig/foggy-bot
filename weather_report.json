    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a vibrant warmth, the kind that beckons one to step outside and breathe deeply. The sky is a canvas painted in soothing shades of blue, dotted with the occasional wispy cloud that drifts lazily in the gentle breeze. Temperatures dance around a comfortable 69 degrees, gradually cooling as the afternoon progresses. The wind whistles softly from the west southwest, a familiar companion that lifts the spirits as it brushes lightly across the skin.\n\nAs twilight approaches, a hint of change lingers in the air. Tonight's forecast suggests the possibility of patchy drizzle after 11 PM, lending an air of mystique to the otherwise sunny day. The clouds will thickly blanket the sky, wrapping the world in a soft cocoon of gray. For now, however, the city shines with clarity; the golden hues of the late afternoon sun cast a warm glow on the bustling streets below. As you contemplate a late stroll, a visit to a favorite caf\u00e9 for a delicately brewed coffee might be just the ticket, or perhaps a leisurely walk through a nearby park, where the rustling leaves serenade the evening. A light jacket would serve well as the temperature dips towards the welcoming embrace of evening, preparing you for the delightful unpredictability of a San Francisco night.",
