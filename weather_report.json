    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, a gentle veil of clouds drapes over the streets, softening the light as it filters through, keeping the city cool and muted. With temperatures drifting toward the mid-fifties, the West wind whispers through the alleyways, creating a brisk backdrop that complements the serene gloom. Though the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate and the Transamerica Pyramid remain discernible, their edges appear softened, hinting at the gentle embrace of a marine layer that has yet to fully cede its hold.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the promise of rain hovers in the air, a promise set to materialize later tonight, awakening the fresh scent of damp earth. The low will dip to a cool 49, inviting those stepping out to bundle in layers that reflect the day's evolving mood. Those with evening plans would fare well in a light jacket, perhaps with a scarf wrapped loosely, ready for the imminent drizzle. With the air thickening with mist and the prospect of rain, a quiet stroll through the illuminated streets can transform into a reflective journey, punctuated by the rhythmic patter of raindrops, echoing against the backdrop of the city\u2019s twinkling lights.",
