Sunshine filters through, lighting up the iconic vistas, and though the temperature hovers near the mid-fifties, there's a nip in the air\u2014a gentle reminder of the breezy west winds brushing against the cityscape. The soft rustle of leaves accompanies gusts that playfully lift the edges of jackets and hats. As afternoon approaches, expect a slight dip in warmth, urging those outside to embrace layers that can be easily shed as the sun ascends.\n\nTonight, the sky promises to remain mostly clear, allowing for a tranquil evening under the stars. The coolness will deepen, making it a perfect moment to wrap oneself in a cozy sweater or a light jacket. The night is a canvas for quiet strolls or a leisurely cup of coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, where the city's vibrancy can still be felt while the world slows down around you. Today\u2019s conditions invite exploration, whether it\u2019s a walk across the Golden Gate Bridge or simply enjoying the splendor of the city from a local park.
