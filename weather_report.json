    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Downtown San Francisco, the skies are adorned with a brilliant azure, benevolently warmed by the sun, despite a brisk breeze coming from the west-southwest. The high temperature gracefully settles near sixty-six degrees, but as the afternoon dances on, expect it to gently retreat to around sixty-four. As you walk through the lively streets, the wind whispers at about twenty-one miles per hour, occasionally gusting higher, inducing a refreshing coolness that offsets the bright warmth of the sun. \n\nAs evening falls, the clouds begin to weave in a captivating tapestry, cloaking the skyline with a soft embrace. The temperature dips to a comfortable fifty-seven degrees, inviting layers that may include a light sweater or jacket to fend off the chill. With the marine layer lurking just beyond the city, opportunities abound to wander the picturesque waterfront or explore the intricate neighborhoods that define this iconic locale. As the day unfolds, why not find a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm drink or take a stroll among the historic streets, soaking in the unique character that San Francisco offers on this splendid afternoon?",
