    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the evening unfolds under a blanket of mostly cloudy skies, with the gentle embrace of a west-southwest wind whispering around 9 miles per hour. The air is cool, hovering near a refreshing 50 degrees, stirring a promise of what the morrow may bring. As dawn awakens, the city may greet patchy fog swirling softly in the early light, then gives way to a day marked by a flirtation with sunshine, though the clouds will remain a steadfast companion.\n\nThe forecast suggests a high lingering around 58 degrees, only to drop slightly through the afternoon. Residents should anticipate a chance of rain, perhaps akin to the region's poetic unpredictability, with a 40% probability for some light drizzles to grace the cobblestone streets. While the gusts may playfully dance up to 25 miles per hour, it\u2019s prudent to dress in layers, perhaps pulling on a light jacket to ward off the chill and the remnants of the fog. In such a mood, one might meander down to a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink while watching the city tease the horizon, or stroll through quiet alleyways, where each step offers an invitation to discover something familiar yet new amid the majestic architecture kissed by the sea mist.",
