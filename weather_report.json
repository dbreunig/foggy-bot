    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the sun reveals itself shyly through a veil of serene clarity, perfect for those who appreciate the city\u2019s urban beauty and its coastal charm. The temperature hovers around a temperate and inviting 62 degrees, softened by a steady west wind that brushes through the streets at 21 mph, occasionally gusting just a little stronger, reminding all of that quintessential San Francisco breeze. While fog tends to sneak over the bay, today it appears muted as it lingers near the horizon, not intruding upon the vibrant blue above, allowing one to bask in the gentle warmth of mid-afternoon light.\n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will remain mostly clear, transitioning to a tranquil night with temperatures dipping into the low 50s. For those venturing out, a light jacket is advisable as the breezes may turn a tad brisk once the sun dips below the skyline. This is a splendid day to wander through the city\u2019s iconic streets, perhaps enjoying a leisurely stroll at Crissy Field, where the views of the bridge are set against the backdrop of a transitioning sky, or savoring a coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 nestled among the charming rows of Victorian homes. Whatever your choice, the day invites calm exploration\u2014a subdued adventure through the heart of a city that provides endless delight.",
