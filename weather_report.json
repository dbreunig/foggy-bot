    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a light shroud of uncertainty lingers in the air, a harbinger of the day ahead. The chill of early morning settles comfortably around 48 degrees, as the possible whispers of rain tease with a mere 20% chance. The day promises a gradual ascent to a brisk 58, with temperatures gently retreating to 56 by afternoon. The soft breath of the west wind, fluttering between 2 to 12 mph, carries the coolness that is a signature of this city, inviting locals to wrap themselves in light layers.\n\nThe skies, partly cloudy and offering glimpses of sun, hint at a canvas of mottled gray and blue, leaving a faint outline of San Francisco's iconic skyline. The marine layer, though elusive, may still be clinging to the waves, creating a visual tapestry that refreshes the spirit while hinting at potential fog elsewhere along the coast. This tempered weather encourages a casual stroll through the streets, perhaps stopping by one of the quieter parks or exploring the nooks of a local caf\u00e9. With a light jacket, enjoying a warm brew while watching the day unfold from a sun-drenched terrace could be just the antidote for any lingering early morning lethargy.",
