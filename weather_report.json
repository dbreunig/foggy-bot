    "weather_report": "As the sun slips quietly beneath the horizon, the clouds gather a gentle whisper of the night. Currently, Downtown San Francisco is cloaked in a slight haze, with the possibility of rain lingering delicately in the air. The temperature rests at a nippy 46 degrees, under a blanket of mostly cloudy skies. A northwesterly wind dances lightly around the city, adding a cool touch to the night, hinting at the intricacies of weather yet to come. The forecast hints at daytime clouds gradually yielding to a moderate sun, yet not before the city experiences a chance of rain early in the afternoon.\n\nAs the day unfolds, one might find the city shrouded in a thin veil of fog that clings lovingly to the iconic outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge, likely drifting away with the sun\u2019s hopeful rays. With temperatures aiming for a high of 56, attire should blend comfort and warmth \u2013 layers will serve you well as you navigate the streets. A light jacket paired with a cozy sweater may be the perfect defense against the lingering chill. Today\u2019s activities might best take shape in a leisurely stroll through the quieter streets of the Mission, indulging in the aromas of freshly brewed coffee or exploring the vivid murals that breathe life into concrete walls, each telling a story of the city\u2019s evolving spirit.",
