As afternoon approaches, the warmth will cradle you comfortably, hovering around 67 degrees\u2014ideal for a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely picnic in one of the city's serene parks.\n\nHowever, as the sun dips lower, the evening will usher in a gentle shift, as clouds blanket the sky, hinting at the cool embrace of night that will settle around 60 degrees. The west southwest wind, playful yet amiable, will add a subtle breeziness, whispering secrets of the ocean as it sweeps through the streets. For those venturing out this evening, layering becomes key\u2014wrap yourself in a light cardigan or a casual jacket to navigate the transition from warm light to cooler shadows with ease. \n\nWith this delightful weather, consider wandering to one of the city's inviting caf\u00e9s or embarking on a quiet exploration of a local art gallery, where the day's artistic offerings can be savored over a latte.
