As evening approaches, the skies will turn partly cloudy, inviting a serene twilight that feels perfect for winding down. Given the mild temperatures, a light jacket or sweater will be your best companion while wandering the waterfront or enjoying a leisurely stroll through one of the city\u2019s many parks.
