    "weather_report": "The atmosphere in Downtown San Francisco is currently painted with shades of gray, draped under a veil of clouds that whisper of the sea. The chill in the air hints at the remnants of the evening's marine layer, though it clings less tightly now than it did mere hours earlier. As the afternoon unfolds, the skyline emerges hazily, with soft outlines of buildings reaching upwards in muted tones, while the iconic Golden Gate Bridge shyly veils itself, almost playing hard to get behind a layer of mist. This dusky tableau reflects a gentleness, making the day feel both tranquil and a touch melancholic.\n\nLooking toward the remainder of the day, there is a slight chance, barely a murmur at 20%, of a few raindrops after five o\u2019clock, but for now, the skies remain largely dry. The temperatures, hovering comfortably near 69, invite light garments that embrace the cool breeze, perhaps a light jacket for the evening hours or a cozy sweater while sipping coffee at a cafe where you can watch the light change as the sun dips. The soft whispers of wind will dance around you at a brisk pace of up to 14 mph, adding a refreshing note to your stroll through the streets or a leisurely exploration of local shops. Today is a day to embrace the rich textures of the city\u2014perhaps through the quiet contemplation in a park or enjoying a book in a sun-dappled nook, while the clouds above weave their stories of the sea.",
