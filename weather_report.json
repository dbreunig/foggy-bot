    "weather_report": "Tonight, the air in Downtown San Francisco remains predominantly clear, accompanied by a gentle southwest breeze. The nighttime serenity is infused with a cool whisper, hinting at the refreshing temperature settling around the mid-fifties. Shadows cloak the city in tranquility, making it an inviting scene for evening wanderers, perhaps suggesting an al fresco dinner or a stroll along the waterfront, where the quiet murmur of the waves gently brushes against the shore.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Wednesday, expect a sunlit embrace illuminating the skyline. The day beckons with a promise of warmth, nudging the temperatures to a comfortable high near sixty-nine. Gentle winds will tease at your hair, adding a lively touch to the sunny ambiance. There is little sign of the fog that often caresses the bay; instead, clarity reigns, allowing for those expansive views towards the Golden Gate and beyond. Dress in layers, perhaps a light sweater over a short-sleeved shirt, so you may bask in the warmth while easily shedding it as the sun climbs higher. This is a day made for gentle exploration\u2014consider perusing the arts along Valencia Street or perhaps sipping a brew in a sun-kissed park, where the city\u2019s vibrant life unfolds at your feet.",
