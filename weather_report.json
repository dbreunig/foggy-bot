A low of 54 degrees whispers from the edges of the bay, while a soft southwest wind caresses the streets, carrying with it the salty tang of the sea. The night sky, though partly obscured, promises a tranquil beauty as the city lights twinkle below, illuminating the famous hills with a soothing glow. \n\nTomorrow brings a muted anticipation of raindrops, appearing after 5 PM, as the day unfolds partly sunny with a high near 62. A subtle dance of clouds will grace the horizon, and the gusty winds will nudge the day along, blowing between 8 to 14 mph. This forecast hints at a captivating transition from day to night, so comfortable layers are essential\u2014perhaps a light jacket to wrap around you, along with a scarf to fend off the evening chill. The intermittently clear skies and the occasional chance of rain could lead a thoughtful wanderer to stroll along the waterfront or seek refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9\u2014an ideal perfect scenario filled with warmth and reflection while sipping a cup of something rich.",
