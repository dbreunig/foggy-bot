    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun shines brightly over Downtown San Francisco, bathing the city in a warm glow while ushering away any remnants of fog. With highs reaching a pleasant 74 degrees and a mild west wind weaving through the streets, the day is poised to be wonderfully inviting. The skyline stands proud against an azure backdrop, offering no hint of the marine layer that often blankets this coastal city. As the day rolls on towards evening, expect a smooth transition to clear skies with temperatures settling into a comfortable 58 degrees, making for a serene night.\n\nFor a day like this, the attire should remain light yet layered, allowing for the gentle shift in temperature come evening. A simple light jacket will do well for those venturing out later, perhaps for a leisurely stroll through the bustling streets or a quiet moment at one of the parks overlooking the bay. It's the perfect time to enjoy a cup of coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9 or perhaps take in the vibrant atmosphere of the local shops, as the city embraces this sunlit lull before the evening calm.",
