    "weather_report": "As morning unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle air of anticipation dances through the streets. The day greets you with an almost ethereal clarity, though a slight chance of rain lingers in the air until the afternoon. In the shadows of hills, the Golden Gate Bridge stands resolute, perhaps partially cloaked by whispers of fog that cling stubbornly to its towers. With temperatures hovering around a crisp fifty-eight degrees, the soft caress of a west-southwest breeze invites layers that can be shed in ebbing sunlight, yet kept close for the coolness of the breeze.\n\nAs dusk approaches, expect the chance of rain to weave its way into the evening. The sky will remain mostly clear, creating a canvas for the soft glow of streetlights below as you stroll through neighborhood streets. Clad in light layers\u2014perhaps a sweater beneath a casual jacket\u2014you may find pleasure in an evening walk or simply slowing your pace to encounter a local caf\u00e9. A warm beverage will surely complement the rising temperatures of the night, with hints of rain promising to usher in a new day laden with the scent of freshness. Adventure awaits, subtly urging you to lean into the charms this dynamic city offers.",
