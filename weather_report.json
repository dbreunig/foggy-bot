    "weather_report": "Tonight in Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is serenely clear, a soft reprieve from the usual fog that lingers by the bay. As temperatures drift down to a gentle 46 degrees, the gentle northwest breeze whispers promises of a crisp night. The calmness of the current conditions invites a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the city\u2019s lights shimmer like distant stars against the inky sky. \n\nTomorrow will greet you with sunshine, a welcome sight casting golden hues over the iconic skyline. Expect a high near 61, gradually slipping into the cooler embrace of afternoon. Dressing in layers will serve you best: think a light jacket over a comfy sweater, ready to shed when basking in that lovely midday warmth. Given the idyllic daylight, consider a visit to Golden Gate Park for a tranquil wander, or perhaps a cozy caf\u00e9 where you can savor a warm drink while enjoying the vibrant sights of the city. With such clear conditions and the playful sunlight ahead, there\u2019s an undeniable charm in embracing the day\u2019s delights.",
