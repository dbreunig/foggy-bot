    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city is kissed by a mostly sunny outlook that promises to unfold beautifully throughout the day. The morning air is crisp and fresh, hovering around a mild 66 degrees, then gently dipping into the soft embrace of 63 by afternoon. While a gentle southwest breeze stirs, creating a pleasant rustle among the leaves, it's the absence of fog that truly makes this morning shine. The iconic Golden Gate Bridge stands boldly against the azure sky, its suspension cables gleaming in the sunlight, free of the usual harbor mist that sometimes cloaks the city.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect the sky to transition into partly cloudy softness, with temperatures settling into a comfortable 53 degrees. This is a day for simple pleasures \u2013 perhaps a stroll along the Embarcadero, where vibrant culture and stunning vistas await, or a leisurely exploration of local galleries. A light jacket or sweater will suffice as the sun dips below the horizon, complementing the breezy warmth of the day. Enjoy San Francisco's charm in this lovely weather \u2013 it beckons you to savor each moment as the city reveals its splendid character.",
