    "weather_report": "As the night envelops Downtown San Francisco, a muted ambiance prevails, rendered even softer by the overcast skies that cradle the city in their embrace. With a low temperature hovering around 52, the evening feels pleasantly cool, whispered along by a gentle west-southwest breeze. The typical hustle of the streets is tempered, as if the marine layer is turning down the volume on the city\u2019s usual clamor. Fog may occasionally creep in, blurring the outlines of distant landmarks, but its presence feels inviting rather than intrusive, wrapping the familiar landscape in an enigmatic cloak.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the prospects shift towards a more cheerful disposition as the clouds begin to part, giving way to a partly sunny day where the high will reach around 60. This transition holds the promise of a mellow day, ideal for strollers traversing the waterfront or explorers meandering through the urban maze. As the sunlight filters in, expect a refreshing breeze blowing in from the southwest, accompanied by occasional gusts that disrupt the calm but offer a reminder of the Bay\u2019s lively energy. A light jacket or a cozy sweater will serve well against the lingering chill, making it comfortable for those eager to sip coffee al fresco or engage in quiet conversations at a nearby park. The heart of the city awaits, inviting quiet moments of reflection as the day unfolds, a canvas both tranquil and invigorating.",
