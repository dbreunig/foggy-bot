    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning unfolds with a clear sky that hints at a pleasant day ahead. The sun casts its gentle warmth, coaxing the temperature toward a welcoming high near 70, though a cooling breeze will usher in comfortable relief as the day progresses. The west-southwest winds, brisk yet invigorating at 13 to 24 mph, weave through the streets with occasional gusts that dance like playful whispers among the city\u2019s iconic structures.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds will gather, wrapping the night in a soft, velvety embrace, while the temperature gracefully dips to around 58. In this transition, the wind continues its spirited cadence, fostering a cozy atmosphere perfect for evening strolls. While the fog typical of our coastal locale is momentarily absent, the presence of a marine layer may beckon later, reminding us of the ever-changing character of this city by the bay. \n\nTo fully enjoy the day\u2019s offerings, consider light layers\u2014perhaps a comfortable shirt paired with a light jacket for the late afternoon and evening. This is a splendid time for a leisurely walk along the waterfront, savoring a moment of reflection as sea breezes beckon. If adventure calls, a visit to a nearby caf\u00e9 or an exploration of the vibrant local art scene may provide nourishment for both soul and spirit.",
