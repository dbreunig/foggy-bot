    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun casts its golden hue across Downtown San Francisco, a refreshing breeze flirts with the treetops, a balmy 65 degrees offering an invitation to bask in this fleeting summer glow. Though some clouds hover on the periphery, the skyline remains wearied yet resolute beneath a vast dome of blue, hinting at the promise of clarity. The air hums with a gentle energy, though the west-southwest wind, robust and untamed, dances at 21 mph, playfully ruffling hair and whispers of the sea.\n\nAs night approaches, a subtle shift is anticipated; a slight chance of drizzle may grace the pavement after hours, a mere caress of moisture in a panorama where the marine layer, even at this hour, lingers close, perhaps wrapping its arms around the edges of the Golden Gate and softening the edges of the day. It\u2019s a reminder of that ethereal fog known to veil the city in mystery\u2014not fully present today, yet still lingering nearby, a gentle presence in the background.\n\nIn this serene setting, lighter layers are your companions, perhaps a light jacket to fend off the evening chill as one strolls along the Embarcadero, savoring a quiet coffee or exploring local shops. As the sun sets, taking a leisurely walk to watch the transmutation of colors in the sky feels as natural as breathing, each moment stretching like the shadows of the setting sun over the restless waters of the bay.",
