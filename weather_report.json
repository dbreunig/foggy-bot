    "weather_report": "As the night descends on Downtown San Francisco, a gentle breeze whispers through the streets, bringing a comforting coolness under a canopy of mostly clear skies. The temperature hovers around a mild 56 degrees, inviting a light layer for those venturing outdoors. Tomorrow promises a transition into a radiant day, where sunshine will dance across the city, coaxing highs of 77 in the afternoon. The gentle north winds, a mere 6 mph, will carry the warmth, making it feel pleasantly balmy before the temperatures dip ever so slightly later in the day.\n\nWhile the evening might seem still, hints of fog linger in the distance, characteristic of this vibrant coastal city. The marine layer may subtly creep in, with its tendrils possibly swirling around the Golden Gate, yet it appears to be holding back for now. Tomorrow morning might invite a brief foggy embrace, giving way to clarity as the sun establishes its reign. With this delightful weather, one might choose to explore the lush expanses of Golden Gate Park or enjoy a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. Layering is key to navigate the day's fluctuations, but those who dress lightly will find themselves comfortably embracing the spring air, basking under the sun's nurturing glow as San Francisco awakens anew.",
