    "weather_report": "Downtown San Francisco is basking in a gentle afternoon glow, the kind that feels both tranquil and invigorating with its mostly sunny disposition. As the sun hangs in a mellow sky, warmth teases the cool air, reaching for the upper 60s before settling back into the comforting embrace of the afternoon chill. A light westerly breeze flutters softly, offering a reprieve from the lingering coastal coolness that often blankets the city. However, a hint of the marine layer can be detected along the bay, where wisps of fog cling to the water\u2019s edge, creating an ethereal backdrop for the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate.\n\nAs nightfall approaches, the clouds will gather like old friends, ushering in a cozy atmosphere with temperatures dipping to around 50. Cozy jackets and layered clothing will serve well against the mild bite of the evening air. Tonight could invite something simple yet rewarding\u2014a quiet stroll through your favorite neighborhood, perhaps a spontaneous stop for coffee at a local caf\u00e9, where conversation flows as freely as the espresso. This is a day painted in calm shades of blue and grey, an invitation for you to explore the understated beauty of the city as it settles into the dusk.",
