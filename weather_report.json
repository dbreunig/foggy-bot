    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this afternoon, the air hangs crisp and mostly clear, the city basking in gentle sunlight that feels surprisingly fresh for a day in late March. As the sun ascends further, temperatures hover around a comfortable 59 degrees, only slightly dipping to a cool 57 later, with a mild west wind providing a refreshing touch. Despite the promise of a beautiful day, a hint of marine influence lingers, suggesting that the notorious fog may make a brief appearance later as it often does, creeping in from the edges but currently holding its distance. As dusk approaches, expect clarity to continue, transforming into a peaceful night with temperatures settling around 47 under a blanket of stars, accentuated by a soft breeze.\n\nThis embrace of spring is perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to one of the local cafes for a warm drink while watching the world go by. Layered attire will serve you well; a light jacket will fend off the chill of the evening air as you enjoy the lengthening shadows cast by the setting sun. Whether soaking in the views from a rooftop or wandering through the streets, the day invites you to savor those little moments of connection with the city and its sweeping vistas.",
