    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the night unfolds under a thick blanket of clouds, generously drenching the landscape with intermittent rain showers. The air is cool, hovering around a mild 51 degrees, as gusts whip through the streets, carrying the scent of the ocean and a hint of pine. As dawn approaches, the promise of more precipitation fills the atmosphere, with the day expected to bring continued rain and the possibility of thunder rumbling in the distance. By midday, temperatures will settle around a brisk 56 degrees, eventually dipping into the low 50s; a subtle reminder that winter is alive and well here.\n\nVisibility is likely to be limited as fog and the marine layer creep in from the bay, lending an ethereal quality to the bridges and hills. Embracing this weather calls for a cozy, layered outfit; a soft wool sweater paired with a stylish raincoat will bridge the gap between warmth and practicality. Footwear that guards against puddles without sacrificing flair is a wise choice for navigating the slick city streets. With the skies shrouded in gray, a walk through the rain-soaked parks could prove to be a contemplative endeavor, where one might take solace in a warm cafe afterward, sipping a cup of rich coffee while the world glistens outside. Today invites you to embrace the rhythms of this vibrant city, where each raindrop holds a story yet to be told.",
