    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco is cloaked in a delicate veil of clouds, whispering the promise of rain. The air hangs cool and damp, each breath a gentle reminder of the year just begun. As night gives way to dawn, the cityscape is drenched in a muted palette, suggesting a lingering marine layer that shrouds the Golden Gate and softens the edges of the skyline. There's a 60% chance of rain, which may bring only a light drizzle as the hours unfold, tapering off by the afternoon into scattered glimpses of sunlight.\n\nAs the day progresses, temperatures will linger around 55 degrees, dipped slightly lower after reaching a modest high. A gentle breeze from the northeast adds a crispness to the atmosphere, inviting one to layer lightly for comfort. A jacket or a cozy sweater will serve well against the chill, especially if one ventures near the water, where the ocean\u2019s breath enhances the cool air. Today is not the day for grand excursions but rather for quiet moments\u2014perhaps a lingering stroll through a local caf\u00e9 with warm pastries calling, or time spent in a favorite bookstore, wrapped in the pages of a well-loved novel. For those seeking solace from the rain, a leisurely afternoon spent at home nurturing newly formed resolutions might just be the balm needed for creative contemplation.",
