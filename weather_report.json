    "weather_report": "Today, Downtown San Francisco is basking in the pleasant embrace of a sunny afternoon, with temperatures lingering comfortably as they transition from the high of 67 toward an evening respite around 65. The gentle north breeze carries the crispness of the bay, enhancing the day\u2019s clarity and inviting a sense of exploration. As twilight approaches, the cityscape is set against a backdrop of vibrant blue skies, unfettered by fog or haze. \n\nWith the mercury dipping to around 50 tonight, layers are advisable, a light sweater perhaps, to ward off the evening chill as it settles in. This delightful weather crafts an ideal atmosphere for a stroll along the Embarcadero, where the water sparkles and restaurants hum with life; perhaps a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 or a stop by a bookstore to savor an afternoon read while sipping on something warm. As daylight wanes, the city feels alive, inviting both adventure and reflection in its serene, sunlit embrace.",
