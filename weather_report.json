With temperatures climbing to a high of 63 degrees, the atmosphere carries a pleasant warmth tempered by a brisk west-southwest wind, swirling at 13 to 22 mph and producing invigorating gusts that dance around 28 mph. As the afternoon approaches, the warmth begins to retreat, settling around 61 degrees, while a distinct clarity envelops the area, revealing the outlines of familiar landmarks against a dazzling blue sky. \n\nTonight, the charm of the city does not fade; it envelops into a gentle embrace of partly cloudy skies, with a low of about 51 degrees inviting a crispness to the evening air. Thin layers of fog may drift in from the coast, hinting at the resilient marine layer characteristic of this vibrant locale. Dress comfortably in light layers\u2014perhaps a fitted sweater or jacket to combat the chill that marries with wind, readying oneself for a serene stroll through the neighborhoods or a quaint cafe visit to savor a warm beverage while the sun bids its farewell. The day is ripe for exploring city sights, meandering through parks, or simply enjoying the calm before the evening settles, offering a soundtrack of soft laughter and the distant murmur of streets buzzing with life.",
