The air, once crisp and vivid, now carries a subtle coolness that whispers of the marine layer curling around the horizon. The forecast hints at a gentle evening ahead, with a low temperature resting around 56 degrees. A west-southwest wind dances through the streets, at times rushing with enthusiasm, bringing with it moments of bracing chill. The skies, partly cloudy, create a canvas tinged with resilience, presenting an invitation for evening strolls through the soft glow of street lamps reflecting on the pavement.\n\nLooking ahead, Monday arrives with a mild promise\u2014a slight chance of drizzle lingers in the afternoon air as the sun finds its way among the shifting clouds. A high near 63 allows for a comfortable embrace of the day, flickering between sunlit warmth and the embrace of shadows. Attire should blend practicality with comfort: layers will be your ally, as a light sweater or jacket becomes essential when the wind picks up, ensuring your evening out remains enjoyable, even as the air carries whispers of fog rolling in from the bay. This blend of coast and city calls for a relaxed afternoon\u2014perhaps a leisurely walk to one of the local cafes or a quiet reading nook where you can let the world drift by, swaying between the pleasures of city life and the serene openness of the coast.",
