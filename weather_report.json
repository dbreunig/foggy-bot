    "weather_report": "In the tranquil hours of this early August morning, Downtown San Francisco wraps itself in a gentle embrace of the night. A slight drizzle lingers in the air, hinting at a soft moisture that may brush the city as the day unfolds. The skies are mostly clear, yet there is an ethereal quality to the atmosphere, a palpable stillness punctuated by the occasional gust of wind sweeping down from the west. This breeze carries a refreshing chill, a reminder of the bay\u2019s cooling influence, with gusts powerful enough to stir the leaves on the trees and rustle urban fabrics.\n\nAs the sun rises, we can anticipate a gradual transformation. The forecast promises a sunny midday, with temperatures gently climbing from a mellow 56 degrees to a comfortable 67. However, in the afternoon, a subtle retreat is expected as the cool coastal air takes command, pulling temperatures down to a more temperate 65. Dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a cardigan to ward off the morning coolness, giving way to a short-sleeved shirt or blouse by midday. As the city awakens and transitions to a brighter, clearer day, take your time to stroll through the local parks, sip warm coffee from a corner caf\u00e9, or simply relish the unfolding beauty of a classic San Francisco summer day, where fog and sun engage in their own delicate dance.",
