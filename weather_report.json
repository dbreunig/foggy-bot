A slight drizzle lingered in the early hours, yet now the clouds part, inviting a mild sun to cast its gentle warmth. With temperatures settling around 65 degrees, the air feels crisp but far from biting\u2014an invitation for those venturing outdoors. A west-southwest wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it a refreshing coolness, albeit with an occasional brisk gust that stirs the thoughts and freshens the spirit.\n\nToday calls for a mix of partly sunny skies with patches of lingering marine layer, hinting at the fog that often wraps its arms around the Golden Gate in the early morning. While the sun attempts to penetrate the haze, it\u2019s prudent to don a light jacket or sweater, as the afternoon wind may whisk through the streets with surprising chill. The evening will usher in a mostly cloudy sky, settling comfortably around 56 degrees\u2014a perfect backdrop for a quiet dinner or a leisurely walk along the waterfront. With the pace of the day inviting exploration, one might consider a stroll through the nearby parks, perhaps savoring a coffee at a quaint caf\u00e9, or simply watching the world unfold from a sidewalk perch, where the pulse of the city can be felt without hurry.",
