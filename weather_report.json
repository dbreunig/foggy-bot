    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens beneath a veil of clouds, holding onto the remnants of the night\u2019s coolness. The temperature lingers comfortably around fifty-three degrees, a gentle reminder that summer\u2019s warmth has yet to fully take hold. A brisk wind, swirling from the west, whips through the streets, nudging anyone braving the early morning air. The atmosphere is draped in a soft haze, typical of the city's capricious embrace with its coastal fog, perhaps hinting at the day\u2019s unpredictable moods.\n\nAs the sun ascends, the clouds are expected to part, revealing a tapestry of blue by midday, with the mercury inching toward sixty-one degrees. Those who wander out will find the brisk wind still at play, invigorating but cool. Layering becomes essential; a light jacket over a t-shirt will suit both the crisp morning air and the anticipated sunny afternoon. This weather paints a perfect canvas for mundane adventures, inviting wanderers to explore the local coffee shops or take a leisurely walk along the waterfront. Alternatively, nestled in a cozy nook with a warm drink and a good book might be just the ticket for those wishing to savor the subtle dance of the day.",
