    "weather_report": "As dusk settles on Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is a blend of anticipation and tranquility. The remnants of a crisp day linger, with clouds gathering on the horizon, hinting at the rain expected overnight. A light southwest breeze stirs, whispering through the streets and carrying the chill of approaching showers. Visibility remains fair, although a delicate marine layer creeps in from the bay, softening the edges of distant landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge, as if swathed in a gentle veil of mist.\n\nAs night approaches, temperatures will dip briefly but gracefully into the low forties. The possibility of rain after five serves as a reminder to don a light jacket or a warm layer before venturing out for an evening stroll or that late-night coffee run. One might enjoy the cozy ambiance of a nearby caf\u00e9, perhaps indulging in a rich hot chocolate while watching the city prepare for its nightly repose. With rain settled firmly in the forecast for Sunday, now is the perfect time to savor the charm of the city before the impending downpour arrives to renew and invigorate the urban landscape.",
