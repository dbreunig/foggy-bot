Tonight, the skies are mostly clear, enveloped in a soothing warmth, with temperatures easing down to a mild 56 degrees. A gentle westerly breeze stirs the air, whispering through the urban landscape at six to ten miles per hour, providing a delightful contrast to the day's bustle.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, a mostly sunny day emerges, with a high creeping near 66, followed by a subtle descent into cooler afternoon temperatures. The west-southwest winds will pick up, bringing gusts that may flirt with twenty-three miles per hour, dancing through the streets and offering little hints of refreshment. This inviting weather presents an ideal opportunity for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where one might savor the fading light over the bay or find a cozy caf\u00e9 to unwind with a good book. Dress comfortably in layers to anticipate the evening's chill, perhaps pairing a light sweater with your favorite jacket as you navigate the inviting streets of this vibrant city.",
