    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sky greets us with the promise of sunshine, yet there's an undercurrent of coastal charm that remains ever-present. The high temperature will hover around a comfortable 63 degrees, tapering down to about 61 later, as a brisk west-northwest breeze whispers through the streets. As the day progresses, one might find themselves drawn to the sprawling parks or lively caf\u00e9s, where the cheerful atmosphere invites leisurely strolls or cozy moments with a book in hand. \n\nDespite the sunny forecast, the city's identity retains its signature fog, potentially lingering near the Golden Gate, wrapping the bridge in a delicate embrace and enhancing the mystery of the landscape. With a low tonight around 50, a light jacket or sweater seems prudent as the sun dips and the twilight reveals a canvas of stars blinking through the thinning haze. The transition from the day\u2019s brightness to the cool serenity of evening holds an allure that beckons urban explorers to partake in quiet moments by the bay or perhaps to enjoy a relaxed dinner at an outdoor eatery, where one can savor warm fare amid the fresh seaside air.",
