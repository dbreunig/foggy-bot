    "weather_report": "As the city awakens in the quiet hours of this summer night, the skies are predominantly clear, offering a gentle promise of what lies ahead. Overnight temperatures will cradle you in mildness, settling around 58 degrees, while a modest southwest wind whispers softly, making a tranquil backdrop to the ongoing urban symphony below. \n\nCome morning, expect the sun to peek through as it rises higher in the sky, ushering in a day of mostly sunny splendor. With a high reaching about 74 degrees, the afternoon will see a slight cooling to 72, as those aforementioned winds pick up and dance through the city streets, occasionally gusting to 25 mph. There appears to be little fog, an elusive marine layer largely absent, allowing the daylight to embellish the urban landscape without interruption. As you step out, consider layering a light cardigan or a breezy shirt against the brisk winds. This day invites milder pursuits: perhaps a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the expanse of the bay beckons or a quiet moment with a book at a local caf\u00e9, while the sun paints the world in shades of warmth and clarity.",
