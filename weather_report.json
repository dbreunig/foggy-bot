    "weather_report": "Tonight, the atmospheric tapestry over Downtown San Francisco drapes itself in a thick curtain of clouds, lending an almost tranquil air to the evening. The temperature hovers gently around a cool 54 degrees, inviting cozy layers to ward off the nips from the west-southwest wind blowing at a steady pace of 15 mph. With gusts reaching up to 18 mph, the breeze rustles through the streets as if whispering secrets of the fog that lingers nearby, hinting at its ephemeral presence without fully revealing itself. \n\nAs dawn breaks on Sunday, the city shakes off its nocturnal cloud cover, welcoming a gentle sun, coaxing warmth that may rise to about 62 degrees before settling back into a comfortable embrace of 60 as the day unfolds. The west-southwest winds persist, flexing their muscles with gusts that may touch 23 mph, creating a playful tug among the treetops and vibrant sails creating a rhythm across the bay. The clarity of the day promises a refreshing outing, perfect for a stroll along Pier 7 or perhaps indulging in a cozy nook at a caf\u00e9, sipping coffee and savoring a pastry while watching the world drift by. Dress in layers, as the morning's crisp embrace gives way to a touch of warmth by midday\u2014it\u2019s a day best experienced outdoors, where the spirit of the city finds its voice amidst the laughter of friends and the soft melody of passing cyclists.",
