    "weather_report": "As the sun attempts to break through the clouds over Downtown San Francisco, today reveals a canvas of partly sunny skies, with temperatures hovering around a comfortable 65 degrees. The gentle west-southwest breeze blows with a playful edge, rustling through the leaves and adding a brisk touch to the air. However, as afternoon tiptoes closer, expect the temperature to cool slightly, settling into the lower 60s. The day may begin bright, but don\u2019t forget the whispering hints of a marine layer that may linger, softening the sharp edges of the cityscape.\n\nAs twilight draws near, the clouds will gather, shifting the atmosphere to a more subdued melody of mostly grey. With a low settling around 56 degrees, it would be wise to layer a light jacket over your casual attire to embrace the cooler evening. A stroll along the Embarcadero could be the perfect remedy for the day, or perhaps a quiet moment spent in a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink as you watch the city wind down. Whether meandering through the streets or finding refuge indoors, today offers a delicate balance of pleasant moments amid the cool sea air.",
