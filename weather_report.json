    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the morning awakens to a hint of drizzle, soon to retreat in favor of a more tranquil afternoon. The high will hover around 63 degrees, kissed by a west-southwest wind that flutters gently at times yet asserts itself in gusts, playful and brisk. The skies, once cloaked in fleeting moisture, will yield to a modest sun, illuminating the day with warmth tempered by that ever-present, cool ocean air.\n\nAs night approaches, a balanced coolness will settle in, inviting the evening's calm under partly cloudy skies, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a gathering with friends at an outdoor caf\u00e9. Warmer layers will feel right at home, a light jacket or sweater complementing the still breezy atmosphere. Activities like a casual bike ride through the park or a visit to a local gallery will suit the mood, as the city reveals its charm beneath a tapestry of evolving clouds and light.",
