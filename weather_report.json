While the day remains largely unencumbered by fog, a subtle marine layer may whisper along the coast, hinting at the evening's embrace. For those looking to savor the moment, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to one of the city's hidden parks is just the remedy, where the golden reflections on the water can evoke a serene calm.
