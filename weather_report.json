The forecast hints at the sun\u2019s return, promising a mostly sunny day that will gently warm the city to a pleasant high in the mid-60s. For now, however, the sky is cloaked in a delicate veil of clouds, reflecting hints of twilight with a soft glow that suggests the marine layer may still be resting close to the water. The gentle southwest breeze carries the crisp ocean scent, a reminder of the coast's ever-present embrace.\n\nAs the day unfolds, anticipate the clouds to recede, revealing the bright, golden warmth of spring. The lingering chill is a signal to dress in layers \u2014 a light sweater or pullover will serve you well in the morning air, while a comfortable shirt will suffice as afternoon sunshine begins to grace the city. It\u2019s a day for cozy yet stylish pursuits; perhaps exploring the sidewalk cafes along Market Street, where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with the gentle pulse of footsteps on the pavement. Or, take a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park, where the blooms are ready to awaken under the sun\u2019s caress, inviting you to pause and savor the beauty of the season.",
