Yet, as the day matures, a subtle shift begins\u2014the celebrated fog, a hallmark of San Francisco, makes its slow resurgence. Its delicate veil dances over the cityscape, particularly along the edges where the ocean kisses the land, hinting at the cool embrace that nightfall will bring.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect the skies to become more shrouded, cloaking the day in a soft, muted palette.
