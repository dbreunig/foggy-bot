The day\u2019s high wanders near a comfortable 65 degrees, though it soon dips slightly toward the early evening. A playful breeze from the west southwest flirts with the buildings, promising a nice respite from the ordinary. As the sun continues its journey, clouds will gradually knit themselves together, creating a tapestry above, but for now, the clear skies provide a delightful blue canvas. \n\nAs twilight descends, expect the temperature to cozy down to around 56 degrees, bringing with it a soft blanket of mostly cloudy skies. The wind will persist, occasionally gusting to whisper secrets through the alleys. It is best to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a t-shirt to balance the day's warmth and the evening\u2019s chill. Given the pleasant conditions, an evening stroll through the city is perfectly inviting; perhaps exploring a quiet corner caf\u00e9 or visiting one of the many parks to bask in the lingering light. Enjoying the burgeoning evening atmosphere, where the city begins to twinkle in the soft embrace of dusk, offers a perfect backdrop for reflection and connection.",
