    "weather_report": "As the clock clicks past the witching hour, the night's calm settles across Downtown San Francisco, a city kissed by the cool embrace of twilight. The forecast promises a mostly clear night with a gentle breeze, lulling you into a serene sense of peace. The low tonight drapes the skyline in a soft blanket of 56 degrees, inviting you to linger in the quiet of the evening. \n\nCome Tuesday, the sun will rise to reveal a mostly sunny day that nudges the temperatures toward a comfortable 77 degrees. Expect a gentle decline in warmth as the afternoon rolls in, offering a sweet reprieve with the temperature settling around 74. A modest north wind will tease through the streets, perfect for a leisurely stroll or an al fresco lunch at your favorite caf\u00e9. Though nothing seems to hint at an encroaching marine layer or fog, it's a good idea to carry a light jacket, contrast to the day\u2019s charms, in case that familiar chill from the bay makes an appearance. \n\nWhether you choose to sip your morning coffee on a park bench or explore the hidden corners of your neighborhood, the day holds promise for simple pleasures. Perhaps a visit to a local bookstore, where the rustle of pages flutters like whispers among the shelves, or a meander through the streets, where the rhythm of city life hums its sweet melody, is in order. Let the day's gentle invitation guide you in your pursuits, as San Francisco awakens, wrapped in the promise of warmth and light.",
