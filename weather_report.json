    "weather_report": "As the sun stretches to illuminate the streets of Downtown San Francisco, the day begins with a gentle, mostly sunny disposition. The air carries a crispness that invites moments of reflection amid the bustle of the city. While the temperature is expected to peak around 65, it will gracefully ease to a cooler 62, ushered by a mild westerly breeze that dances between 6 and 14 mph. Tonight, the clouds will gather, hinting at the restorative embrace of evening, with thermometers dipping down to about 55.\n\nCurrently, the fog holds a subtle presence, lingering near the coastline but leaving the heart of the city with a clearer palette. The visibility is satisfactory, though some hints of the marine layer may brush the edges, softening the outlines of the Golden Gate Bridge. Consider donning layers\u2014a light sweater or jacket will provide comfort against the cool air and the forthcoming blanket of clouds. Today is reminiscent of those perfect urban afternoons; a walk through Golden Gate Park, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a quiet moment with a book, or perhaps an exploratory meander through the streets, where each turn reveals the eclectic nature of this vibrant city.",
