    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city emerges from a night draped in a garment of persistent clouds. A cool breeze whisks through the streets, reminiscent of soft whispers, welcoming the early risers with a low temperature hovering around 57. While the skies might still wear a veil of gray, it hints at lifting as the sun makes its appearance. \n\nCome midday, anticipate a lightening of spirits as the clouds begin to part, revealing glimpses of sunshine that warm the air. Highs will reach about 65 degrees, providing a comfortable canvas for the day ahead, but as the afternoon settles in, expect a slight dip toward a cooler 63. Accessorized by winds from the west-southwest, gusts will tease at the day with a playful intensity, reaching up to 30 miles per hour. Given this dynamic weather, it would be wise to don layers\u2014a light jacket or a cozy sweater paired with something breathable below. \n\nAs the day unfolds, it\u2019s an inviting time for a leisurely stroll around the neighborhood, perhaps indulging in a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9 while savoring a warm beverage. Beyond that, a casual exploration through the streets or a visit to a local gallery could provide a delightful escape. Whatever the choice, today offers the subtle pleasure of a city alive with the promise of sun and the energy of wind, just shy of encroaching fog from the coast.",
