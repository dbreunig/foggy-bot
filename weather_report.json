The temperature hangs comfortably around the mid-50s, whispering hints of warmth with the dawn. As Tuesday approaches, sunshine will grace the landscape, lifting spirits and brightening the iconic landmarks of the Bay. Expect the mercury to rise, flirting with the high 70s before settling into a calm, moderate warmth in the afternoon.\n\nAs daylight unfurls, one might find the horizon stretching distinctly clear, unmarred by fog and revealing the Golden Gate Bridge standing proud against the landscape. With such inviting weather, a light layer could be all you need\u2014perhaps a cardigan or a light jacket for the morning chill, transitioning to a breezy shirt as the sun blankets the city in warmth. A stroll along the Embarcadero could beckon, where the bay glimmers invitingly, or perhaps a quiet coffee in a sunlit caf\u00e9 while the city goes about its day, would be the perfect way to savor the unfolding beauty.",
