    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks gently over Downtown San Francisco, the city awakens under a veil of clouds, hinting at the lingering embrace of the marine layer. The air carries a refreshing chill, reminiscent of the ocean's breath. By mid-morning, the clouds are expected to part, giving way to a pleasing sunlight that promises a high of around 65 degrees. The day will transform, shifting from the muted grays of morning to the warmer hues as the sun casts its glow, but one mustn't be fooled; a brisk west-southwest wind will tug at your clothing, reminding you of the bay's ever-presence and the cool undercurrent that runs through these streets. Gusts may rise as high as 28 mph, so it's wise to dress in layers, perhaps with a light sweater or jacket to ward off the early chill, while preparing for sunnier moments that call for comfortable attire befitting this spirited city.\n\nAs the sun starts to appear, the outdoor landscape invites you for gentle strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to one of the nearby parks to savor a coffee while basking in the warmth. With the fog retreating, the views become clear, offering glimpses of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, standing resolute over the bay. Such a day, filled with transition from the soft embrace of morning fog to the vibrant edges of sunlit afternoon, beckons for exploration yet encourages a pause to appreciate the serene moments that define this unique coastal locale.",
