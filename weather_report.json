    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over San Francisco, the streets awaken beneath a bright, sunny sky. The air is cool and invigorating, with daytime temperatures flirting with the low 70s, gradually easing to a comfortable 65 as afternoon approaches. The gentle west-southwest winds carry a whisper of salt, promising a day where the fog is kept at bay, revealing the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge against a canvas of blue. While patches of marine layer linger off the coast, it recedes, allowing the city to bask in clarity and warmth\u2014a rare gift of spring in this coastal haven.\n\nFor those venturing beyond their doorsteps, this is a day best met with light layers. A comfortable t-shirt or blouse accentuated by a light jacket offers versatility as the day unfolds. Whether ambling along the Embarcadero, stopping for a leisurely coffee near the Ferry Building, or exploring the vibrant streets of Chinatown, the conditions invite a sense of leisure. As the sun dips later tonight, expect a slight chill, making the prospect of gathering with friends for an early evening meal particularly inviting, with the warmth of good company perfectly complementing the gentle, cool breeze that will settle in.",
