    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sky hangs heavy and mostly cloudy, an atmospheric blanket that tempers the day's warmth, which struggles to reach 57 degrees. A brisk west wind adds a gentle chill, rustling leaves lined along the streets, while gusts remind passersby of the city's character. The nearly muted sun seems hesitant, casting a soft light that dances with the clouds, leaving the landscape clad in shades of gray. The marine layer is thin but persistent at the edges of the Golden Gate, shrouding the vistas in a delicate veil that invites introspection rather than exuberance.\n\nAs twilight drapes the city, the temperature will settle around 50 degrees, prompting a call for layered attire. A light jacket would serve well, particularly if one plans to stroll through the neighborhoods or perhaps seek a cozy corner in a caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with muffled conversation. The clouds may obscure the stars, but the city's allure remains, offering opportunities to explore intimate galleries or to leisurely peruse the shops that line the streets. It\u2019s a moment made for quiet adventures rather than boisterous outings, a time to appreciate the understated charm of San Francisco as it drifts toward evening.",
