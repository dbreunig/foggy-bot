    "weather_report": "In the stillness of night, Downtown San Francisco rests under a blanket of partial clouds, with the crisp air whispering through the streets, marked by gusts that challenge the quiet. The temperature sits comfortably cool, around the low fifties, as gentle winds from the west brush against the cityscape. As dawn approaches, the early hours suggest a promising transformation. Independence Day heralds the sun's return, promising a bright and clear canvas for the day ahead. As the sun ascends, expect a gentle warmth to unfurl, with temperatures climbing near sixty-two before dipping again as the afternoon progresses, mingled with the persistent west winds.\n\nWhile the celebration of the Fourth of July often evokes imaginations of vibrant outings and festivities, today invites a more subdued rhythm. As the sun brightens the horizons, the familiar fog may linger at the bay's edge, hinting at a marine layer veiling the bridges in the distance, contrasting with the vibrant blue sky yearning to break through. This day, although inviting, carries a coolness, so layering becomes essential. A light jacket paired with a short-sleeved shirt will balance the shifting temperatures throughout the day. With a backdrop of sunny vistas and modest warmth, today offers a perfect opportunity for an early morning stroll along the waterfront or a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, where you can savor the simple pleasure of a warm drink while the world wakes beside you.",
