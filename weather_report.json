Tonight, the air is thick with moisture, wrapping the city in a soft embrace as temperatures linger in the cool mid-fifties. Wisps of mist may dance through the streets, particularly near the bay, while the southwest wind murmurs, casting a refreshing chill that invites layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a thin raincoat will prove prudent for evening endeavors. \n\nAs the sun rises tomorrow, it will coax the clouds away, revealing a mostly sunny day ahead. The high will drift close to the cooler end of the spectrum, hovering around fifty-nine, nudging down to fifty-seven as the afternoon unfolds. A crisp westward breeze will accompany this, providing a sharp contrast to the harmonious warmth of the sun\u2014ideal for a leisurely stroll through the alleys or a quiet time at a caf\u00e9 where one can indulge in a steaming cup of coffee while observing the hustle of life. The sane pace of the city on such a day makes it an excellent opportunity to explore the little-known corners of Downtown, perhaps discovering a hidden bakery or a unique shop along the way.",
