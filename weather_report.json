    "weather_report": "The heart of San Francisco pulses with a gentle warmth today, as the sun reigns supreme over the skyline and the iconic Golden Gate Bridge stands out against the azure backdrop. It\u2019s a day where the west southwest winds whisk away any lingering traces of the typical fog, leaving behind a crystalline clarity that invites both wanderers and the contemplative. As you stroll through the city's neighborhoods, the high around 73 feels pleasantly comfortable\u2014ideal for a leisurely day out.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sun will begin its descent, gifting a soft golden hue to the horizon. With a low settling around 58, a light jacket would serve you well, particularly as the west winds begin to pick up slightly, offering a teasing reminder of the evenings cooling caress. Given the delightful weather, this is a moment for simple joys\u2014perhaps a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 for a warm beverage, or a stroll along the waterfront to witness the shimmering bay reflecting the twilight. It is a day tailored for quiet pleasures, where the beauty of the landscape beckons and the gentle breeze stirs the soul.",
