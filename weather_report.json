    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls over Downtown San Francisco, the city greets the morning with a sense of calm and clarity. Though the sun has not yet fully risen, the sky hints at a promising day ahead\u2014softly illuminated, with a gentle coolness hanging in the air. The early hours carry a low temperature of about 48 degrees, accompanied by a light west-southwest breeze that barely rustles the leaves. The anticipated sunshine will gradually warm the realm, reaching a pleasant 64 degrees, though an afternoon cool-down is in store as temperatures ease back to around 62.\n\nWhile the horizon seems clear at this hour, the marine layer may linger nearby, possibly unfurling its foggy tendrils later in the day along the coastline, particularly near the Golden Gate. If you're contemplating your attire, a light jacket should suffice for the chill of morning, transitioning seamlessly into layers that can be adjusted as the sun takes its place in the sky. Given the gentle warmth expected and the inviting sunshine, the city beckons you to venture outdoors\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, where the rhythmic tides complement the day\u2019s unfolding charm, or enjoy a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, savoring a warm beverage while watching the city awaken.",
