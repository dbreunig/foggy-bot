    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere is painted in shades of mist and cloud, a gentle prelude to the rain that whispers its promise before dawn. The sky, draped in a muted gray, hints at the possibility of fleeting showers which may scatter before the morning light breaks. The cool embrace of the evening brings temperatures that settle around a crisp fifty degrees, while the west wind brushes softly through the streets, carrying a hint of the ocean's salt with it. The chance of precipitation hovers like a delicate specter, lingering at forty percent, suggesting that a light drizzle could accompany the night in a subtle dance of moisture.\n\nAs the sun rises on Sunday, expect a continuation of the overcast skies, the city waking slowly under a quilt of clouds. A chance of rain showers lingers until the late morning, but by noon, the weather will transition into a cooler serenade with temperatures nudging in the mid-fifties. The brisk west-northwest winds, ranging from ten to eighteen miles per hour, will provide a refreshing contrast to the damp chill, a reminder that spring is on the cusp of arrival. Dress in layers to navigate the coolness\u2014a light jacket will serve well against the breeze, perhaps paired with a scarf for added warmth as you wander through the city's winding streets. Given the weather, it's an ideal day to explore the cozy corners of your favorite caf\u00e9, perhaps indulging in a warm beverage while watching the world drift by with a book in hand, or to seek shelter under the arches of the grand bridges, allowing yourself to be swept up in the city's eternal gray romance.",
