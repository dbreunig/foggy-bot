    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the remnants of night linger in the form of a slight drizzle that has now given way to a mostly sunny morning, the promise of warmth filtering through. With a high near 69 degrees, the air carries a gentle west-southwest breeze, rustling the leaves and invoking a sense of movement, as if the city itself is sighing in relief from the night's cool embrace. While the sun shines brightly, it draws a delicate curtain over a wandering marine layer, hinting at fog that may loom just beyond the hills, a whisper of moisture lingering to the north toward the Golden Gate. As the day unfolds, temperatures will dip slightly to around 66 degrees, inviting a light jacket for those venturing outdoors come afternoon.\n\nTonight, a soft aftermath of drizzle may return, cloaking the city in a veil of clouds, with a low settling around 56 degrees. The winds gently continue, maintaining their playful dance. Consider stepping outside for a leisurely stroll through the city's vibrant streets, perhaps to the local caf\u00e9 for a warm cup of coffee, or a quiet read in one of the many parks that dot the area. Embrace the day with layers, as the sun may prevail for now, but its retreat begs for comfort as twilight descends.",
