    "weather_report": "As the quiet hours stretch into the early morning, San Francisco is enveloped in a gentle patch of fog, a familiar shroud that whispers along the edges of the city. The temperatures are cool, cradled near 49 degrees, with a soft west wind caressing the skin, hinting at the day's potential. As the sun rises, it will slowly burn off the fog, revealing a mostly sunny canvas by mid-morning. Expect a high around 66 degrees, which will taper off to about 64 by afternoon, a pleasant warmth tempered by the south-southwest breeze that will help keep the bay air crisp and invigorating.\n\nFor those contemplating how to dress today, layering is the order of the day. A light sweater or a jacket, perhaps paired with breathable fabrics, will serve you well as the temperatures fluctuate from the cool morning into the inviting afternoon. Given the clarity that is promised post fog, your best bet is to venture out and explore the city's myriad delights: perhaps a leisurely stroll through the Mission's vibrant murals, an artful caf\u00e9 break in North Beach, or simply finding a quiet corner at a local park to soak in the ambiance. It\u2019s a day that beckons the curious spirit, inviting you to breathe in the revitalizing air and embrace the charm of San Francisco unfolding before you.",
