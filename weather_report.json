    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco greets you with a gentle, partly cloudy embrace. As the cooler air settles in, the low reaches a comforting 47 degrees, accompanied by a soft west-northwesterly breeze that whispers through the streets. The city, draped in a veil of quietude, invites evening wanderings, perhaps a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero, where the twinkling lights dance on the bay, or a warm cup of tea at a local caf\u00e9 where the day\u2019s chatter lingers in the air.\n\nAs dawn unfolds on Friday, the promise of a mostly sunny day emerges. With a high hovering around 60, the afternoon may see temperatures dip slightly, gently nudging the day towards a cool dusk. The clarity of the morning offers an invigorating panorama, with occasional wisps of marine layer teasing the horizon, though nothing that impedes the uplifting splendor of blue above. Dressing in layers will be key: consider a light sweater or jacket for the morning chill, easily shed as the sun shines on your adventure. A stroll through one of San Francisco\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods or a visit to a local artisan market may bring joy to the heart and warmth to the soul on this delightful day.",
