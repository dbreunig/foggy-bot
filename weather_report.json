    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfurls with a gentle promise of mildness, yet it holds the familiar whispers of the bay\u2019s chill. The sky is partly sunny, with hints of luminescence peeking through the scattered clouds, while a soft southwest wind carries a refreshing touch, stirring the air into a comfortable embrace. As the sun climbs, the temperature will hover near 61 degrees, gradually falling to the cooler realms of 59 by afternoon, inviting light layers for those wandering the streets. \n\nAs twilight approaches, a cozy gloom will settle over the city, clinging close as the clouds deepen and the temperature dips toward a low of 53, making a light jacket or sweater a wise companion. Though the fog may not blanket the landscape entirely today, its presence will linger, especially near the iconic bridge; the marine layer hangs low, teasing the urban sprawl with hints of mystery. On this beautiful yet brooding afternoon, consider a stroll along the waterfront, perhaps stop by a quaint caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or find a bench in a nearby park where you can watch the ebb and flow of life in the city, drawing inspiration from the varied hues of the changing sky.",
