    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco this morning, the sun casts a warm glow over the cityscape, gently illuminating the iconic landmarks that rise against a clear blue sky. With temperatures flirting with 68 degrees, the atmosphere feels pleasantly mild. A gentle southwest breeze stirs, adding a touch of refreshing coolness perfect for a morning stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a leisurely coffee break at a quaint caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating. \n\nAs the day unfolds, you can expect the warmth to subtly give way to the afternoon\u2019s embrace of 66 degrees, keeping the mood inviting yet comfortably cool. While there are whispers of fog clinging to the horizon, it will mainly grace the outskirts rather than enveloping the heart of the city. Tonight promises a mostly clear canvas, as the numbers dip to around 54 degrees, offering a tranquil close to the day. For a wardrobe choice, consider donning a light jacket if you venture out after sunset\u2014a perfect accompaniment to the enchanting city lights. Amid this beautiful weather, why not take a stroll to explore local art galleries or perhaps find a cozy nook in a bookshop to indulge in a forgotten novel?",
