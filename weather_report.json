    "weather_report": "In the quiet embrace of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco sits beneath a blanket of clouds, teasing the promise of drizzle as the city prepares to awaken. The current temperature hovers comfortably around the mid-fifties, a gentle caress from the west-southwest wind, which sways through the streets at a steady pace. With a slight chance of moisture in the air, one might find the atmosphere delightfully fresh, hinting at the cleansing presence of the marine layer that clings to the coast.\n\nAs the day unfolds, optimism begins to peek through the layers of cloud. The sun is poised to break through, gradually revealing a world that will warm into the mid-sixties by midday. The wind, playful and invigorating, will dance between 10 to 21 mph, adding a spirited touch to the afternoon\u2019s ambiance. For those who venture out, dressing in layers becomes essential. A light jacket will serve well against the cool morning air, while a breezy shirt beneath will be perfect for the anticipated warmth. A leisurely walk along the promenade might just be the ideal activity, where the scent of the ocean mingles with the thrill of a new day, inviting one to explore the hidden corners of this vibrant city.",
