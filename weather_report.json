    "weather_report": "The morning in Downtown San Francisco offers a soft, muted ambiance, draped in a blanket of clouds that whisper of the chill lingering in the air. As the clock ticks past the early hour, the temperature hovers around a crisp fifty-two degrees, accompanied by a brisk west-southwest wind that dances through the streets, occasionally rising in playful gusts. The promise of the day reveals itself slowly; come afternoon, the sun will peek through the clouds, warming the air to a gentle sixty-one degrees, inviting the city\u2019s inhabitants to step outside and embrace the changing light.\n\nFor those venturing out, the day calls for layered attire\u2014perhaps a light jacket to ward off the morning\u2019s chill, with a snug sweater underneath for comfort. As the sun rises higher, a casual stroll along the Embarcadero or a leisurely coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9 promises both solace and delight. While fog may hint at its presence from afar, the morning's clarity suggests that the marine layer has chosen to retreat, granting a brief respite from its ethereal touch. It\u2019s an ideal day for quiet exploration or simply enjoying the soft buzz of city life, as nature and urban rhythm converge in a harmonious ballet of light, wind, and whispered secrets.",
