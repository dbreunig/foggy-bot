    "weather_report": "As the night unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle blanket of clouds lingers, offering only a hint of the city\u2019s vibrant skyline. The temperature holds around a mild 55 degrees, accompanied by a soft southwest wind that whispers through the streets, a precursor to the day's promise of warmth. As dawn approaches, the anticipation of a clear and sunny Friday begins to stir\u2014forecasts suggest a high near 70 degrees, though a mellow decline invites the day to cool, settling to around 67 in the afternoon.\n\nThe atmosphere seems poised for a delightful transformation. With a hint of early fog still clinging to the coast, one can expect a gradual unveiling of the Golden Gate Bridge as the sun ascends, pushing away the last remnants of the marine layer. Throughout the day, San Francisco will bask in the golden glow of sunshine, inviting its inhabitants to embrace the outdoors. A light layering would serve well against the brisk morning air\u2014perhaps a comfortable sweater or a light jacket to stave off the coolness until the sun's rays fully warm the streets. As the afternoon rolls in, it becomes a splendid opportunity for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or a visit to the nearby parks, savoring the fresh air and the cheerful ambiance. The day promises an understated elegance, perfect for those seeking simple pleasures amidst the beauty of the city.",
