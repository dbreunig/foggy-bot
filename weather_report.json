    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, a gentle calm envelops the night, as mostly clear skies offer a serene backdrop against which the city rests, like a painting suspended in twilight. Overnight temperatures softly cradle the air, dipping into the low forties, promising a cool yet refreshing embrace as the day unfolds. As dawn approaches, one might sense a whisper of warmth creep in, as the mercury nudges upward. The promise of Wednesday carries with it a hint of anticipation\u2014a chance of rain blossoms in the later hours, transforming the landscape and adding a touch of drama to the otherwise serene morning.\n\nAs the sun rises and casts its light, the day reveals itself partly sunny, dressed in a palette of gentle hues, with a high grazing near fifty-seven degrees. Though rain is hinted for the evening, the early hours showcase a brief window of clarity, offering the perfect moment for a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, perhaps stopping for a coffee with a view of the bay. Wind dances lightly at two to ten miles per hour, keeping spirits lifted while urging one to dress accordingly\u2014a light sweater or jacket would be wise, especially as the day transitions, and those unpredictable droplets make their approach. So, embrace the cool air and venture forth, for life in the city pulses gracefully beneath the promise of the rain.",
