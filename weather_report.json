    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle sun bathes the city, though the warmth remains somewhat contained, hovering around a cool 62 degrees. The sky bears the hallmark of typical San Francisco charm, radiating a soft brightness that contrasts with the whisper of a marine layer veiling the horizon. Here and there, patches of clarity reveal the silhouettes of the city\u2019s iconic structures, yet the presence of clouds indicates that the embrace of fog isn\u2019t far. The breezy west-southwest wind, light yet persistent, rustles through the streets, adding a briskness to the air that encourages a thoughtful layer of attire.\n\nAs night approaches, the clouds will increase their dominion, wrapping the city in a cooler embrace with temperatures dipping to around 50 degrees. This blend of sun and cloudiness presents a picturesque scene, ideal for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or an amble through one of the many parks, where the soft rustle of leaves and the distant hum of the city create a soothing backdrop. Consider donning a light jacket\u2014perhaps a cardigan draped over casual layers\u2014to navigate the gradient of temperatures as the sun fades. Tonight whispers the promise of cozy gatherings or quiet moments under the expansive San Francisco sky, as the fog caresses the landscape, leaving a sense of serene mystery in its wake.",
