    "weather_report": "Today in Downtown San Francisco, the sun shines brightly, draping the city in a warm golden hue, though the brisk winds signal that the chill of the afternoon is imminent. As you step outside, you feel the vitality of a day that promises both warmth and cool retreats; expect temperatures to hover near sixty degrees before settling into a comfortable fifty as night approaches. The West wind is spirited, swirling in at near twenty miles per hour, creating a lively atmosphere that invites you to embrace the day. \n\nTonight, the sky will don a partly cloudy veil, allowing glimpses of the twilight glow, sweetened by the gentle caress of the southwestern winds. Dressing in layers is advisable, a light jacket being a smart choice to stave off the evening chill. With the spectacle of a clear day before you, consider wandering to the waterfront or enjoying a tranquil stroll through the parks\u2014perhaps while savoring a coffee or grabbing a bite at one of the local cafes. The beauty of this day lies in the unhurried moments it offers, perfect for relishing the vibrant life that pulses through the avenues and piers of this charming city.",
