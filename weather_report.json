    "weather_report": "In the heart of Downtown San Francisco, the day unfurls with a gentle pulse of sunshine, setting the stage for a pleasant afternoon. With temperatures nudging toward the mid-60s, a balmy breeze from the west southwest whispers against the skyline, carrying the promise of warmth while keeping the air brisk. As the shadows elongate in the early evening, a veil of clouds begins to roll in, hinting at a patch of drizzle after midnight. Tonight, the mercury dips to a comfortable 56 degrees, with whimsical gusts swirling through the streets, reminding passersby of the city\u2019s secretive charm. \n\nWhile the fog continues to play its unpredictable games with the coastline, this late-afternoon glow allows for enchanting views of the iconic city skyline sans any heavy marine layer. One could enjoy a leisurely stroll through Golden Gate Park, exchanging smiles with fellow wanderers, or perhaps find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, hot drink in hand, as the urban rhythm slows. For warmth, layering is key\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a tee, perfect for those shifting temperatures. A calendar like this begs for simplicity: an evening spent in good company or with a book, savoring the changing moods of the city as it transitions from day to night.",
