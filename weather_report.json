    "weather_report": "As the night unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a muted blanket of clouds ushers in a serene atmosphere, the temperature settling gently around 54 degrees. A steady west-southwest wind dances softly, rustling through the streets with gusts that occasionally reach up to 18 mph, offering a whisper of coolness against the skin. As dawn breaks on Monday, expect the curtain of clouds to part, revealing a mostly sunny day ahead. The sun will rise to grace us with a high near 64, before temperatures retreat to a comfortable 61 by afternoon, all beneath the playful sway of winds between 12 to 23 mph.\n\nThe outlook is decidedly pleasant, inviting exploration of the city\u2019s vibrant streets. Though some pockets of morning fog may linger close to the coast, the marine layer recedes, allowing clarity to define the day. Opt for layered clothing\u2014perhaps a light jacket to fend off the cool morning breeze, replacing it with a comfortable shirt as warmth seeps in. This is a splendid day to wander through the local markets or indulge in one of the quaint cafes, immersing oneself in the rhythm of city life, perhaps taking a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero as the bay shimmers.",
