One may opt for light layers\u2014perhaps a comfortable sweater or a chic jacket\u2014to match the shifting temperatures as night falls. Activities abound, whether savoring coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, wandering through the vibrant streets of the Mission District, or indulging in a quiet evening at one of the many local galleries showcasing the city's artistic spirit.
