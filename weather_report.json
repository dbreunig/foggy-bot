    "weather_report": "As night unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, the sky remains mostly clear, showcasing the gentle brilliance of the city lights against a canvas of darkened hues. The temperature drifts toward a mild 52 degrees, accompanied by a light breeze from the west-southwest, whispering through the streets with a warmth that feels inviting, yet prompts a light jacket as the evening deepens. \n\nThe forecast for Wednesday heralds a sunny embrace, with daytime highs reaching around 67, gradually descending to 64 as the afternoon wanes. This clarity invites a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a quiet read at a caf\u00e9 overlooking the bay. While the usual fog that often cloaks the Golden Gate Bridge in ethereal mystery is absent, the remnants of the marine layer may linger faintly to the north, leaving the day bright and pleasant. Attire should lean towards layers; a comfortable shirt with a light sweater will suffice for the morning freshness, while a sprinkled dash of sunscreen may be wise for those venturing out midday. With the day promising, it\u2019s an opportune moment for a casual bike ride or to explore the vibrant offerings of the Ferry Building Marketplace, enjoying the local flavors and a leisurely pace amidst the rhythm of the city's heart.",
