    "weather_report": "As evening deepens in Downtown San Francisco, the cool, gentle embrace of a mostly cloudy sky blankets the city. The temperature lingers around a brisk 48 degrees, gradually nudging toward 50 as night falls. A light west-northwest breeze, whispering at 7 mph, carries the faint scents of the bay, hinting at the celestial dance of marine air just beyond the horizon.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the sun is set to rise triumphantly, casting a warm light over the iconic skyline, with a high near 62 degrees unfolding. For the day\u2019s adventure, expect temperatures to gradually diminish in the afternoon, inviting woven layers that can be added or shed with ease. A fleece or light jacket will complement the morning's freshness, allowing you to wander the streets, perhaps explore the local caf\u00e9s or charming library reads while savouring the soft warmth of the sun. As the day wanes, the atmospheric clarity beckons a cozy walk along the Embarcadero, where unobstructed views of the bay promise a peaceful end to the day, watching the boats float lazily as the soft hues of sunset paint the sky.",
