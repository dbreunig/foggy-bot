    "weather_report": "As dusk drapes its gentle cloak over Downtown San Francisco, the atmosphere feels laden with expectation. The evening sky, a canvas of deepening gray, hints at the rain that will soon begin its descent from the heavens. With temperatures dipping into the low fifties, a brisk south-southwest wind stirs, whispering through the streets and beckoning residents to prepare for the impending showers. Clouds hang heavily above, shrouding the city in a soft melancholy, while the promise of rain lingers in the cool, damp air.\n\nThe forecast forecasts a relentless downpour throughout the night, transitioning into a day adorned by sporadic rain showers come morning. A well-worn raincoat, sturdy galoshes, and a hearty scarf would do well to shield against the chill and moisture that will envelop the city. Given the gloomy weather, afternoon plans might shift from outdoor pursuits to the warm embrace of a cozy caf\u00e9. Here, with a steaming cup of coffee in hand, one could indulge in a good book or simply watch the rain dance against the windows\u2014an intimate tribute to a San Francisco evening.",
