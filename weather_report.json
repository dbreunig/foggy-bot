    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the early hours are marked by a serene calmness, with the lingering magic of night gently fading into day. As clouds scatter in the night sky, temperatures rest near a comfortable 51 degrees. The soft sigh of the southwest wind adds a whisper of coolness, inviting those awake at this hour to embrace the tranquility before the bustle of the day begins. \n\nAs dawn breaks and the sun begins to rise, expect a mostly sunny disposition from the sky, with temperatures peaking near 64 degrees. The warmth will gradually give way to a mild afternoon, pulling back to around 62. While the day promises clarity and bright hues, one may find the coastal fog making its presence felt, especially towards the Golden Gate Bridge and ocean's edge. A light jacket or a cozy layer will suffice for those venturing out, ideal for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or indulging in a caf\u00e9's morning pastries while immersing themselves in the day's burgeoning energy. Today is a reminder of that beautifully unpredictable nature of our city, poised to offer both solace and the promise of vibrancy.",
