    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in a delicate veil of clouds, lending the city a serene, almost ethereal quality. The air is cool, resting at 55 degrees, and hints of moisture linger, suggesting a slight chance of drizzle that will likely taper off before the morning sun makes its ascent. As day breaks, expect a transformation where the clouds will yield to a more promising sky, revealing a mostly sunny day ahead. By midday, temperatures will hover around a comfortable 64 degrees, gradually retreating to 62 by the afternoon, inviting residents to relish the open air.\n\nThe weather promises a gentle west-southwest breeze, soft but persistent, with gusts whispering through the streets, providing a charming accompaniment to the urban rhythm. Given the light marine layer still kissing the city, one might opt for layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a stylish jacket paired with comfortable jeans. This day calls for exploration; a stroll through the local farmers\u2019 market could be delightful, or perhaps a quiet sit in one of the city\u2019s many parks, catching up on a novel while soaking in the vibrant atmosphere. As San Francisco awakens, you may find an invitation in the crisp air, a gentle reminder to savor the simple pleasures the day offers.",
