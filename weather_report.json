    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle embrace of sunshine breaks the tranquil morning. The cool air carries a hint of the ocean's salt, with temperatures nudging around a comfortable 65 degrees. A breeze, whispering from the west, stirs the leaves and encourages the day to blossom, yet it remains clear enough to reveal the city's iconic silhouette against an awakening sky. In the distance, the Golden Gate Bridge stands stoic, barely touched by fog, a rarity for this time of year, suggesting that the marine layer remains sheltered for now.\n\nAs the sun arcs higher, expect the sky to maintain this pleasant clarity into the afternoon, allowing glimpses of blue and the soft hues of the bay to glimmer. Tonight will bring a slight shift, with clouds making a gracious debut as the temperature dips to around 55. For those venturing out today, light layers are advisable\u2014perhaps a comfortable cardigan or light jacket to counter the gentle afternoon chill, especially if you find yourself by the water. With such delightful weather, consider a stroll through the bustling streets of the Mission District, perhaps a stop by a local caf\u00e9 to savor the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee paired with a warm pastry or the quiet serenity of Golden Gate Park, where nature beckons with its vast green tapestries, inviting you to take a moment to breathe deeply and appreciate the day.",
