    "weather_report": "This afternoon, Downtown San Francisco casts off the morning haze to embrace a mostly sunny disposition, bringing a high near 63 degrees. Yet, even in brightness, the chill of a southwest wind\u2014whispering through the streets at around 16 mph\u2014keeps a refreshing edge to the air, making layers wise for any outing. As the day wanes, the temperature will dip gently to about 56, while clouds begin to gather for a soft evening. There\u2019s a mere hint of drizzle expected late tonight, but the chance is slight, like the possibility of finding a forgotten coin in your pocket.\n\nThe atmosphere carries an inviting clarity, though it may lack the brilliant vibrancy of a summer day. Fog, the eternal companion of the Bay, lurks beyond, possibly wrapping the edges of the Golden Gate, but for now, the city remains open and clear to exploration. As you chart your plans, consider a walk along the Embarcadero or meandering through one of the city\u2019s tucked-away neighborhoods, where you can sip a warm drink and absorb the character of San Francisco under the fading light. For attire, think of a cozy sweater or a light jacket\u2014enough to embrace the evening\u2019s coolness yet easy enough to shed once the sun spills its warmth.",
