    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls across Downtown San Francisco, a muted grayness cloaks the city, hinting at the shifting weather just beyond the horizon. The cool morning air, hovering around 62 degrees, carries whispers of moisture, a promise of rain that seems to linger as shadows dance along the streets. The clouds, dense yet wispy, stitch the skyline into an impressionist dreamscape, while a gentle southwest breeze lightly tousles the leaves. This morning is punctuated by the possibility of showers\u201430% likely\u2014nudging an expectant readiness for a soft patter on pavement later in the day.\n\nBy afternoon, the sky will tease with intervals of sun, where the warmth of 68 degrees might slip through the cloud cover to flirt with the cooler air below, settling into a comfortable 65. The breeze will remain, a steadfast companion, urging city dwellers to layer lightly. A light jacket or a scarf would be wise, perhaps paired with comfortable shoes for an afternoon stroll. The possibility of rain is slightly elevated at 40%, but it's manageable enough for ventures beyond your doorstep. Take advantage of the day to envelop yourself in the vitality of urban life\u2014whether that means sipping coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, entering galleries filled with local art, or wandering through the vibrant Market Street, which will likely bloom in patches of golden sunlight amid drifting clouds. In a city where weather shifts like a seasoned storyteller, embrace the day with an open heart, ready for whatever narrative it spins.",
