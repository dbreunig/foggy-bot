    "weather_report": "As the nocturnal chill drapes itself over Downtown San Francisco, the sky remains mostly clear, revealing a serenity that promises a refreshing dawn. The city, a canvas of glinting lights, whispers of a comfortable repose under a blanket of stars. Morning will greet us with sunshine, urging the temperature to climb comfortably, yet gently, into the realm of pleasantness before the afternoon takes a cooler turn. The soft caress of the south-southwest wind remains barely perceptible, as if it, too, is hesitant to disturb the tranquility of the waking city.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the absence of the famed marine layer allows a rare clarity to illuminate the usually enigmatic skyline. The Golden Gate Bridge might rise gracefully in the distance, unobscured and basking in the sun's embrace. For the casual observer, this presents an idyllic backdrop for a leisurely stroll through the Presidio's lush pathways or perhaps a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9 where one can savor fresh pastries along with the warmth of a morning brew. Dress comfortably\u2014layers are wise in this gentle dance of temperature, as the morning chill is sure to give way to the afternoon sun. A light jacket or cardigan will suffice, inviting you to step outside and embrace the charm of a San Francisco day that appears, at least for now, to be uncharacteristically delightful.",
