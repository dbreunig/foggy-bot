    "weather_report": "Tonight, Downtown San Francisco is cloaked in a blanket of indeterminate gray clouds, signaling a gentle embrace of the marine layer that defines this coastal city. The temperature descends to a comfortable 50 degrees, while a mild west-southwest wind whispers softly, creating a serene backdrop for a tranquil evening. The skies, though mostly cloudy, hold the promise of tomorrow's sunshine, if one can wait just a little longer.\n\nAs Thursday unfurls, expect the sun to weave its way through the coastal haze, bringing warmth that promises to lift spirits and reveal a canvas of soft blues above. Highs near 65 dewy degrees will invite light layers, perhaps a favorite cardigan and comfortable jeans to accompany leisurely strolls or tucked inside a cozy caf\u00e9. With fading light and lingering clouds, now is the time to indulge in simple pleasures: perhaps a gentle walk along the waterfront, where the waves meld into the mystery of the evening, or gathering with friends over artisanal coffee in one of the countless hidden gems throughout the city. Embrace the stillness of the twilight and let it wash over you, for such evenings in San Francisco are a soothing balm for the spirit.",
