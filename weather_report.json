    "weather_report": "As night envelops Downtown San Francisco, the serene expanse of the city lies draped in a clear veil, with temperatures gently resting around a cool 48 degrees. The easterly whispers of the wind brush softly against the skin, a mere suggestion of movement in an otherwise still evening. Tomorrow promises a bright awakening, as a sunlit spectacle unfolds with temperatures rising to a comfortable 68 degrees, a splendid invitation to embrace the outdoors before the afternoon cools to a mellow 65.\n\nThe scenery looks remarkably pleasant as the city breathes beneath a starlit canvas, harboring tranquility and potential. Fog remains absent for now, leaving the iconic skyline unshadowed by the usual marine layer. However, as the dawn approaches, one might anticipate the playful dance between warmth and the cool embrace of Bay breezes. For those venturing into this richly textured urban tapestry, light layers are the key; perhaps a light sweater to accompany a t-shirt, allowing for ease in transitioning from the coolness of the morning to the later warmth. The evening\u2019s peaceful ambiance invites a stroll through the neighborhood or a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9, contemplating the rhythm of the city waking up to the sun.",
