    "weather_report": "The sun casts its gentle glow over Downtown San Francisco this morning, illuminating streets and buildings as a light breeze stirs the air. With the temperature peaking around 62, today feels refreshingly crisp, though hints of afternoon coolness will echo the chill of the ocean, drawing temperatures down to the low 60s. A brisk west-southwest wind dances through the city, lending a lively energy to the day, its gusts weaving between the iconic structures and vibrant neighborhoods. \n\nThe skies are largely clear, with only whispers of clouds grazing the horizon, allowing a rare moment of scenic clarity that reveals the city\u2019s beauty in all its glory. Notably absent is the dense marine layer, which often blankets the city; instead, the vastness overhead invites both optimism and adventure. As the day unfolds, a light sweater or jacket will provide comfort, especially as the evening descends, promising partly cloudy skies and a low of approximately 52. As you step out, consider wandering through one of the nearby parks or indulging in a leisurely brunch at a caf\u00e9 with patio seating, taking full advantage of this lovely day.",
