    "weather_report": "As the evening casts its cloak over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle coolness settles in the air, inviting a reflective pause. Partly cloudy skies weave in and out of the night, with soft winds whispering through the city streets. The temperature lingers around a comfortable fifty degrees, perfect for an evening stroll or perhaps enjoying a quiet dinner al fresco. Flip flops give way to sensible shoes, and a light jacket is your reliable companion against the encroaching chill.\n\nLooking forward to tomorrow, the sun promises to grace the city with its presence, nudging temperatures near sixties, though an afternoon dip will remind us of the fog's lingering charm. Expect a clearer day, yet traces of the marine layer may remain, painting a hazy boundary between the bustling city and the endless blue beyond. Whether you choose to wander the waterfront, savoring a leisurely morning coffee, or explore the myriad hidden gems of local shops, each moment offers a chance to embrace the beauty of a San Francisco day, resplendent in its own unique rhythm.",
