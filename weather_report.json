    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, a gentle drizzle taps at windowpanes, cloaked in a soft veil of clouds. The air, laden with moisture, carries a brisk edge, perfectly accompanied by cool whispers from the west, where gusts tease the shoreline. As the day unfolds, the horizon promises a gradual retreat of the gray, yielding to patches of blue where the sun will eventually stake its claim. With temperatures hovering around the mid-60s, one may feel inclined to layer clothing\u2014a light jacket for the morning chill, perhaps shedding it as warmth filters through by afternoon.\n\nAlthough the marine layer still clings stubbornly to the Bay, it will gradually dissipate, revealing glimpses of the iconic skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge framed by enticing light. Today beckons for a stroll through the quieter corners of the city, maybe a visit to local cafes for a warm cup of coffee or tea, or even a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero as the fog recedes. A creative mind might find inspiration wandering among the vibrant street art, or one could simply enjoy the charm of unexpected drizzles that make the city whisper secrets.",
