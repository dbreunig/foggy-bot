    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day unfolds under a bright sun, painting a clear canvas against an azure sky. As the morning hours progress, temperatures hover around a comfortable 63 degrees, gradually softening to a cool 61 by afternoon. A brisk west wind whispers through the streets at 15 to 25 mph, sending refreshing gusts twirling to heights of 31 mph, bringing with it the promise of a vibrant day free from fog. \n\nFor those contemplating their attire, light layers are ideal; a light jacket or cardigan will suffice against the breeze while allowing for the warm embrace of the sun. Consider a stroll through the lively neighborhoods or a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the outdoor seating invites one to bask in the day\u2019s charm. As evening approaches, the skies will settle into a gentle clarity, with temperatures dipping to 50, beckoning you to perhaps wrap up a delectable meal as the west wind continues to serenade.",
