    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Downtown San Francisco, the air feels crisp and carries the promise of a wet embrace from the rain that is poised to blanket the city by morning. The sky, a tapestry of moving clouds, hints at the encroaching moisture that is expected to arrive with the dawn. Tonight, the temperatures will gently dip to a cool 49, leaving the urban landscape wrapped in a mild chill, stirred by a southward wind that offers occasional gusts to liven the evening.\n\nAs we move into Sunday, prepare for a significant shift. Rain seems inevitable, as the heavens are set to unleash a steady downpour. The high will hover around 60, gradually retreating as the day unfolds. The city\u2019s iconic features, like the Golden Gate Bridge, may find themselves cloaked in a watery veil, merging a sense of mystery with the familiar sights. With these conditions, it would be wise to embrace layers\u2014a light, waterproof jacket over a warm sweater, perhaps paired with comfortable shoes fit for wet pavements. This weather invites a bit of introspection; consider meandering through cozy cafes with a warm drink in hand or finding solace among the treasures of local bookstores as raindrops serenade the city streets.",
