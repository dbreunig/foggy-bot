    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Downtown San Francisco, the city is softly wrapped in a blanket of clouds, cradling the low temperature around fifty-seven degrees. The air carries a brisk energy, with the west-southwest winds whispering through the streets at fifteen miles per hour, occasionally gusting up to eighteen. As the day unfolds, the promise of sunshine emerges, hinting at a warm, amicable afternoon that may see temperatures hover near seventy but dip slightly as the day wanes.\n\nThe marine layer appears to linger, particularly along the coastal stretch towards the Golden Gate, veiling the iconic bridge in a gentle mist, providing an ethereal touch to the morning light. Clarity is on the horizon but may take its time revealing the city's beloved landmarks. Layering becomes essential; a light jacket paired with a breathable shirt will offer comfort against the cool breeze, while also preparing you for the day\u2019s gradual warming trend. A stroll through the Presidio, perhaps with a warm cup from a local caf\u00e9, seems perfectly suited for today\u2019s whims\u2014allowing one to bask in the emerging sunlight while absorbing the soothing sights and sounds of the awake city around you.",
