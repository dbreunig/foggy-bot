    "weather_report": "As the clock approaches midnight in Downtown San Francisco, the city is enveloped in a gentle drizzle, an atmosphere that stirs a comforting intimacy. The night is masked in clouds, painting an almost ethereal canvas overhead, where the raindrops playfully race against one another down the window panes. Surrounded by a sultry breeze from the south, suggestive of more rain to come, the temperature whispers of a cool, crisp night, lingering around 49 degrees. A 90% chance of continuous rain echoes through the streets, promising a symphony of dampened sounds, punctuated by the distant rumble of thunder.\n\nAs the Sunday sun rises\u2014unseen but implied\u2014the possibility of further rain persists, keeping the high hovering near 60, while the winds continue their soft caress. The air will remain thick with the scent of petrichor, an invitation that beckons the brave. Layering becomes essential: a light raincoat over a warm sweater, alongside a comfortable pair of shoes, is advisable as puddles gather secretively in the nooks of the sidewalk. The morning holds potential for exploration within the cozy confines of local caf\u00e9s, where the warmth of fresh coffee mingles perfectly with the chill of the air outside. As daylight advances, it reveals the quiet resilience of a city draped in rain, encouraging solitary walks through the thickening fog or a visit to a gallery, where art becomes a refuge from the weather outside.",
