The air is cool, hovering around fifty-three degrees, under a mostly cloudy sky that holds a hint of mystery. The gentle breath of the west-southwest wind carries not just the chill but also whispers of the bay, as it meanders through the streets like a secret shared between neighbors. \n\nTomorrow morning, the fog may linger until mid-morning, making way for a day that promises to remain mostly cloudy, with temperatures flirting with sixty-one in the early hours before dipping ever so slightly in the afternoon. This unpredictability in the marine layer invites one to dress in layers\u2014a light jacket paired with a warm scarf is a wise choice for those venturing outside. As the calm settles in, one could wander over to a cozy caf\u00e9 for a late-night cup of coffee, perhaps, or enjoy a leisurely stroll along the Embarcadero, letting the bittersweet scent of soft rain remember the day. A night spent tracing the familiar streets under the watchful glow of city lights beckons those seeking the solace of warmth amid the cool air.",
