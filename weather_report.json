    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Downtown San Francisco finds itself wrapped in a gentle curtain of clouds, hinting at a minor possibility of drizzle. The air carries a cool freshness, with temperatures hovering around 54 degrees, inviting a sense of reflective calmness. As the day breaks, the clouds will gradually part to reveal bits of blue, giving way to moments of sunshine that will creep in, transforming the morning's gray into a canvas of soft warmth. Expect the high to settle near a crisp 63 degrees, dipping slightly as afternoon approaches, ensuring a refreshing, invigorating feel, with southwest winds adding a lively touch.\n\nAs you step outside, think practical yet comfortable; a light jacket or a cardigan can serve you well against the briskness, particularly with winds that may be felt more keenly in exposed spaces. Today\u2019s weather invites you to stroll along the Embarcadero or lose yourself in one of the city's cozy haunts, where the hustle and bustle dissolves into the comforting clinking of cups and quiet chatter. Whether seeking solace in a book at a caf\u00e9 or exploring art galleries, the day beckons with understated charm, promising a delightful mix of clarity and cloud as San Francisco unfurls its enchanting possibilities.",
