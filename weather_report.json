    "weather_report": "As night unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, the air is filled with a gentle haze, hinting at areas of fog that will deepen as the clock ticks past midnight. The low temperature, hovering around a comfortable 56 degrees, invites you to wrap a light scarf around your neck. With a west-southwest wind briskly rustling through the city streets at 10 to 20 mph, layered clothing will serve as your cautious companion, allowing you to adjust as gusts reach up to 25 mph.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will make its entrance after a fleeting bout of fog, its rays gleaming down upon a city that will gradually bask in mostly sunny skies. A high near 70 will grace the day, followed by a gentle slide to about 67 in the afternoon. As you navigate the day ahead, consider a casual stroll through Golden Gate Park or perhaps enjoy a peaceful moment with a good book at your favorite caf\u00e9. The day promises clarity and warmth, perfect for a refreshing outdoor brunch or an art gallery visit, where the light can illuminate both the canvases and your spirit. With a bit of foresight in mind regarding the coastal marine layer, choosing breathable layers will ensure that your day is both comfortable and enjoyable.",
