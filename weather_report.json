    "weather_report": "As the early morning hours unfurl in Downtown San Francisco, the city is draped in a vestige of clouds, hinting at the gentle embrace of fog typical of the bay. With temperatures hovering around a cool 53 degrees, the atmosphere carries a damp chill, a whisper of the marine layer that clings to the edges of the skyline. The soft westerly breeze, barely stirring at 3 mph, adds to the tranquil ambiance, making it a fitting time to wrap oneself in a light jacket or cardigan.\n\nAs the day progresses, golden rays of sunshine will gradually pierce through the lingering overcast, revealing a high near 64 degrees. The warmth will diminish by afternoon, kissing the air with a refreshing coolness. Ideal for exploration, this transition offers an inviting canvas for leisurely strolls through the city\u2019s iconic streets or a visit to one of its cherished parks. Perhaps there's joy to be found in a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink as daylight unfolds, or a chance to peruse the shops, gathering inspiration from the vibrant pulse of urban life. Dress in layers to comfortably navigate the shifting temperatures, and embrace what this relatively subdued yet distinctively San Franciscan day has to offer.",
