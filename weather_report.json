    "weather_report": "As the city that cradles the Golden Gate Bridge drapes itself in the embrace of night, the air carries a crispness\u2014refreshing yet gentle, summoning the soul to wander through its quiet streets. A low of around 50 degrees whispers promises of a mostly clear night, with only a soft breeze from the west-southwest to coax a few serene clouds across the sky. Dawn is just a breath away, heralding a day that will unfold like a sun-drenched tapestry.\n\nTomorrow's sunlight will stretch over the bay, gracing the sidewalks and cobblestone paths with warmth, leading to a high near 63. It\u2019s a day meant for exploration, perhaps a visit to the Ferry Building Marketplace, where the scent of freshly baked bread mingles with the surge of local produce. As the winds sweep in from the south-southwest, you might feel inclined to don a lightweight jacket\u2014something to soften the chill of that occasional gust. The morning's brightness holds promise, but be prepared for the marine layer's gentle cloak that may roll in, softening the edges of that golden vista we adore. In the simplicity of this serene day, one might find joy in a leisurely stroll, a casual cafe visit, or perhaps a quiet moment on a park bench watching the world glide by. In the heart of it all, the city is a living poem, inviting you to join in its verse, even if just for a passing moment.",
