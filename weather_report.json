    "weather_report": "In the stillness of early morning, Downtown San Francisco finds itself cloaked in a gentle layer of fog, a whispered reminder of the coastal charm that often veils the city. The streets, wrapped in a cool embrace with temperatures dipping into the realm of 49 degrees, invite a sense of tranquility. As the day unfurls, the fog will gradually recede, yielding to the soft glow of a partly sunny sky, though the chill lingers, with daytime highs tapering off to around 56, and a certain crispness keeping the air vibrantly alive.\n\nFor those venturing outside, a light jacket or sweater is wise, ideally layered over a comfortable outfit to navigate between the morning\u2019s coolness and the afternoon\u2019s gentle warmth. It\u2019s an ideal morning for discovery: perhaps a stroll through the quieter streets, a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the scent of pastries, or the enchanting allure of the parks, where nature whispers its secrets amid the trees. The day beckons softly, promising an effortless blend of relaxation and exploration.",
