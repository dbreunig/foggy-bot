Though the temperature hovers near 64, the vibrant blue sky, speckled with a few wispy clouds, extends an inviting invitation to embrace the outdoors. The west-southwest winds carry a briskness, brushing through streets and alleyways, a gentle reminder of the coast's presence. \n\nTonight promises a graceful transition into cooler hours, with temperatures dipping to around 55. The clouds will begin to accumulate, whispering tales of the fog that often hugs the coastline; however, for now, clarity reigns as the city basks in warmth. Ideal attire for this delightful day would include light layers\u2014a perfect combination of comfort and style, enabling one to roam freely. As dusk descends, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the light lingers on the waves, or perhaps find solace in a quiet caf\u00e9 with a book, letting the evening unspool at a beautiful, languid pace.",
