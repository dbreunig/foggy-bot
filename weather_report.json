    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, it welcomes a largely sunny canvas, presenting a subtle warmth that barely lifts the hem of the day, with temperatures hovering around the mid-50s. A gentle west-southwest breeze, weaving through the city\u2019s iconic streets, serves as a reminder of the cool charm that envelops this coastal haven. However, a deeper glance into the horizon reveals the approaching embrace of evening clouds, hinting at the rain that is set to roll in later tonight, transforming this clear vista into an introspective tapestry of clouds and droplets.\n\nIn anticipation of the shifting weather, it would be wise to don a light jacket, perhaps woven with a touch of nostalgia for a drizzled evening stroll through the bustling streets or a cozy bookshop nestled within the city's heart. With rain expected to grace the city after 11 PM, the time is now perfect for quiet pursuits: perhaps indulging in artisanal coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or losing oneself in the delightful aisles of a nearby bookstore as the world outside slowly succumbs to the call of the rain. As you take in the vivid charm of this lively city, let the beauty of a sunny afternoon and the promise of evening rain introduce an element of contrast to your day.",
