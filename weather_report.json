    "weather_report": "As the morning sun peeks from behind a curtain of light cloud cover, it casts a muted glow over Downtown San Francisco, hinting at the promise of a pleasant day. The air feels fresh, though a slight chill lingers, whispering of the ocean's proximity. The vividness of the city is somewhat subdued, with only a hint of the golden hues shimmering through the marine layer, suggestive of a playful dance between sun and fog. With a gentle breeze weaving through the streets from the west, the temperature hovers comfortably around 63 degrees, yet those venturing out should be prepared for a slight drop as the afternoon progresses.\n\nAs the hours unfold, a slight chance of drizzle remains, fading in the early evening, likely leaving behind only traces on the pavement. Clouds will blanket the sky tonight, possibly wrapping the city in a soft, gray embrace as the temperature dips into the mid-50s. Dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a knit scarf\u2014to savor the cool serenity of this San Francisco summer day while setting off for a leisurely walk along the Embarcadero or finding solace in a cozy caf\u00e9 where the smell of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the lingering scent of the bay. Each choice feels like a gentle nod to the city\u2019s rhythms, allowing one to savor its understated charms even on days when the fog plays coy.",
