    "weather_report": "A gentle breeze dances through Downtown San Francisco this evening, carrying with it the promise of a star-kissed sky. As the sun dips toward the horizon, the city glows warmly under a drift of clear skies, casting a serene view across the bay toward the Golden Gate. With temperatures comfortably resting around 60 degrees, it's a night that invites wanderlust; the winds, brisk yet soothing, whisper tales of the ocean's embrace.\n\nWhile the forecast does hint at the possibility of a light drizzle as the clock nudges toward late night, for now, the atmosphere prevails with a soft clarity unmarred by fog. The marine layer, commonly at play in this coastal corner, remains at bay for the moment, leaving the city free to enjoy the cool, inviting air. Light jackets layered over casual attire will suffice, maintaining comfort against the potential chill that descends later. For those seeking solace from the workweek, the evening presents an idyllic backdrop for a stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet gathering at a local caf\u00e9 to savor the end of the day.",
