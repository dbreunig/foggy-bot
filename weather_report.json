    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Downtown San Francisco, a gentle warmth bathes the city beneath a bright, expansive sky. The sun casts a vibrant light onto the streets, reflecting the promise of a perfect spring day. A crisp west wind stirs, invigorating the air with a refreshing touch that hints at the ocean\u2019s proximity. While the temperature hovers around a delightful sixty degrees, the breeze whispers sweetly in the ears of those strolling down the avenues, inviting them to step outside and savor the moment.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect the clouds to begin their slow encroachment, dimming the day\u2019s brightness as they weave a thin veil over the horizon. The air will grow cooler, settling into the low fifties, and the wind will maintain its playful demeanor, occasionally gusting as it brushes against the skin. While rain is a mere whisper in the forecast, a slight chance lingers, reminding passersby to keep a light jacket at hand. \n\nToday is a gentle nudge toward leisure, beckoning you to explore a local caf\u00e9 with a well-padded armchair, where the aroma of freshly roasted coffee dances in the air. Or perhaps take a moment to wander the pristine waterfront, observing the sailboats gliding gracefully across the bay, their sails puffed with the wind's spirited energy. Dress comfortably in layers, as the interplay of warmth and chill is the essence of a San Francisco day in May, inviting you to embrace the beautiful contrasts that define this charming city.",
