    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun graces Downtown San Francisco with its warm embrace, illuminating the streets and the skyline while a gentle breeze stirs the air. The high of 59 degrees feels just right, especially as the city\u2019s fickle weather suggests a slight retreat in temperature later in the day. The clarity of the sky reveals a rare crispness, free from fog or the usual marine layer that often swathes this coastal haven. Instead, the visibility stretches invitingly towards the Golden Gate Bridge, creating a serene backdrop for afternoon strolls or spontaneous escapades atop the hills.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will transition to a deepening blue, the sun slowly dipping behind the horizon, leaving room for a comfortable night around 46 degrees. With winds gently rustling at 6 to 16 mph, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to enjoy a cozy gathering at a local caf\u00e9 or perhaps an invigorating walk along the waterfront, where the gentle lapping of the bay complements the low hum of life in the city. Layering up might be wise, a light sweater or jacket to stave off the evening chill while you take in the sights of this vibrant metropolis as it shifts from day to night, painting the streets in warm hues of twilight.",
