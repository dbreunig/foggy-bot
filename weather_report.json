    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the day begins with a gentle, inviting sunlight lacing through the air. The streets, bathed in a crisp clarity, seem to awaken slowly under a high sky, brushed with faint wisps of clouds. A pleasant breeze rustles through the avenues, hinting at the tantalizing shift yet to come, as the temperature teeters around a comfortable 60 degrees. As the afternoon approaches, expect the warmth to gently recede to the mid-50s, encouraging layers that flow with the day's rhythm.\n\nHowever, a transformation is imminent. As evening draws near, the delightful sunshine will yield to an impending rain, creeping in quietly around 11 PM with a 90% chance of refreshment. The clouds will thicken, cloaking the city in a muted embrace, while gusts from the south southwest playfully flurry about. Tonight's chill will settle in the low 50s, making it a perfect moment to wrap yourself in a cozy sweater or light jacket as you sip a warm drink and watch the rhythm of the city shift towards its nighttime lull. Such weather lends itself beautifully to a leisurely stroll through the neighborhood or a quiet rendezvous at a local caf\u00e9, savoring warm pastries as the scent of distant rain whispers in the air.",
