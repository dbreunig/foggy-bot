    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens over Downtown San Francisco, the air carries a certain crispness, heralded by scattered clouds giving way to a gentle evening breeze. The temperature settles around a comfortable 56 degrees, making it a pleasant retreat from the day\u2019s hustle. Gusts of wind, playful in nature at 20 mph, whisper through the streets, hinting at the forthcoming charm of a sun-drenched Sunday. \n\nTomorrow promises a bright reprieve, with the sun poised to unfurl its golden arms, warming the city to a cozy 65 degrees. While this evening brings hints of fog, it does not shroud the beauty that lies just beyond; the marine layer drifts, its presence felt rather than appraised. To navigate this mixture of weather, layering will serve well\u2014a light jacket over a comfortable tee might just be the antidote to the evening\u2019s chill. As the time beckons for calm pursuits, consider a simple stroll through vibrantly lit streets or perhaps an evening of reflection at a local caf\u00e9, where the coffee is as warm as the ambiance.",
