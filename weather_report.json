    "weather_report": "As the world outside stirs beneath a canopy of muted gray, Downtown San Francisco finds itself cloaked in a gentle embrace of cloudy skies. Overnight brought a hint of drizzle, just enough to lend a sheen to the pavement but not to disrupt the night's calm. The temperature lingers comfortably around 55 degrees, with a zephyr whispering softly from the west. This morning, the promise of a slight chance of drizzle hangs in the air until late morning, yet the clouds are eager to part, revealing patches of blue as the sun begins its ascent.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the city will witness a gradual transition, where the fog retreats, allowing the warmth of the sun to touch the streets. By lunchtime, the chill will recede, and as temperatures hover near 64 degrees, a casual sweater may become unnecessary. A light jacket should suffice for the morning's slight chill. The afternoon will serenade residents with mild winds and an inviting atmosphere, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s tranquil parks. Consider lingering over coffee at a local caf\u00e9 or wandering through the vibrant streets, where the scent of fresh pastries might accompany the soft sound of conversation as San Francisco stirs joyfully into its day.",
