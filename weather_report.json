    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the early morning, Downtown San Francisco is enveloped in a gentle haze, hinting at the rain that may soon kiss the pavement beneath the weight of the looming clouds. The temperature is brisk, suggesting a coat will be a wise choice as the wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it the promise of occasional showers. As the day unfurls, it may grant some moments of brightness, yet the specter of rain remains a constant companion, with temperatures gently slipping into the cool embrace of the afternoon.\n\nThe atmosphere is tinged with a certain melancholy beauty typical of early March, urging its inhabitants to don layers that provide warmth while allowing for the comfort of movement. As the city begins to stir, it's the perfect time to venture into your favorite caf\u00e9 for a warm drink and a moment of reflection or to amble through lesser-traveled streets adorned with the aromas of fresh pastries and invigorating coffee. Daylight may struggle to pierce the clouds, but the San Francisco spirit thrives on unpredictability, offering opportunities for exploration around every corner, even as the fog and rain dance overhead.",
