    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over Downtown San Francisco, it casts a warm glow that begins to dissipate the lingering veil of morning fog. The forecast heralds a splendid day, promising sunshine with temperatures climbing slightly to a comfortable 74 degrees. Gentle breezes will sweep through the city, adding a refreshing touch to the clear, blue skies overhead. By midday, as the sun reaches its zenith, expect the warmth to beckon, with the temperature tapering off to a mellow 72 as afternoon sets in.\n\nThe early hours bring a crispness in the air, with the mercury dipping to 58 tonight, a perfect invitation for a light jacket or a cozy sweater as evening unfolds. The clarity of the day suggests that the iconic Golden Gate Bridge will stand proudly against the skyline, its grandeur unchallenged by fog. Given these inviting conditions, a stroll along the waterfront will feel particularly rejuvenating; perhaps a visit to the Exploratorium or a quiet moment at Crissy Field, soaking in the views of the bay. So find a seat in the heart of the city, whether at a caf\u00e9 or a park bench, and relish the beauty of a late summer day in San Francisco.",
