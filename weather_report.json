    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco today, the sun graces the skyline with a gentle warmth, ushering in a pleasant Labor Day. Highs hover around a comfortable 73, accompanied by a west-southwest breeze that tickles the skin at around 16 mph, interspersed with occasional gusts. As the evening draws near, a delicate hint of marine drizzle may weave its way into the night after 11 p.m., mingling with the soft, lingering warmth. With a nighttime low of about 58, the air remains refreshingly cool, subtly reminding those wandering the streets to keep a light jacket or sweater close at hand.\n\nThe city\u2019s clarity is striking, showcasing the iconic architecture and the shimmering bay, unmarred by fog for the moment. However, a patchwork of soft mist may roll in as the day succumbs to night. It\u2019s an ideal time to meander through the neighborhoods, perhaps picking up a book from a quaint bookstore or taking a stroll along the waterfront, soaking in the explorative energy of the city. As the sun sets, the atmospheric shift encourages indoor gatherings with friends, where laughter and stories can blossom in the cozy embrace of shared warmth.",
