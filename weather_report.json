As you prepare for the day, consider a light jacket or a cozy sweater, perfect for a stroll along the Embarcadero as the city stirs to life. In the afternoon, as the sun emerges more boldly, the pleasant warmth will invite you to linger outdoors, perhaps savoring a quiet coffee at a caf\u00e9 with an inviting patio.
