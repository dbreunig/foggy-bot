    "weather_report": "This afternoon, the skies over Downtown San Francisco are basking in a rare moment of clarity, a crisp contrast to the usual marine fog that tends to linger. The sun shines brightly, its warm glow perhaps hinting at a promise of vibrancy as temperatures hover around 64 degrees, only slightly dipping to 62 as the day unfolds. The west wind, brisk and lively at around 25 mph, brings a refreshing chill that dances through the streets, ensuring that while sunlit warmth is present, it comes with a reminder of the city\u2019s coastal charm.\n\nAs night descends, the horizon will shift to a more subdued palette, with patchy drizzle making an appearance after 1 AM. The clouds will blanket the city, creating a cozy cocoon, and temperatures will lower to around 54. Dressing for this transition calls for layers; consider a light jacket to shield against the evening's briskness, perhaps accompanied by a soft scarf. With the day coming to a close, a stroll through the park or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 can be a perfect way to soak in the tranquil beauty of the evening, while listening to whispers of the wind that carry the promise of fog tomorrow.",
