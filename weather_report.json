    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Downtown San Francisco, the city greets the serene embrace of a gentle rain, expected to arrive softly after 11 PM. The skies are thick with clouds, wrapping the world in a muted gray. What's left of the day's light fades, revealing a temperature that hovers around a cool 49 degrees. Winds whisper from the south, stirring up leaves and carrying the promise of rain, their gusts managing a playful dance against the evening chill. With a solid 90% chance of precipitation, it's wise to expect the dampness that accompanies spring. \n\nAs we look to Sunday, rain will remain a steadfast companion, particularly as the day opens under the sleepy gaze of a high near 60 degrees amidst a canopy of clouds. Walking through the city tomorrow, one might feel the rhythm of raindrops on umbrellas while donning a light jacket and sturdy footwear, a nod to both comfort and practicality. This weather invites a pause, perhaps a rare opportunity to enjoy a quiet moment indoors\u2014consider cozy cafes with warm beverages, the aroma of freshly baked pastries lifting spirits amid the drizzle. The rain has a way of slowing the city down, turning the bustling streets into a tableau of reflection, where conversations linger over steaming mugs, and time feels pleasantly suspended.",
