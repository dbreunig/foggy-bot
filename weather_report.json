    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Downtown San Francisco unfolds beneath a vast expanse of azure, punctuated by a few playful clouds drifting gracefully overhead. The sun bathes the city in a refreshing light, enhancing the shimmering outlines of its iconic skyline. Though a slight chance of rain looms in the backdrop, for now, the ambiance remains predominantly dry and bright, with temperatures hovering pleasantly in the mid-fifties. The gentle west wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it the crispness of early spring while revealing only the faintest remnants of fog that might linger along the fringes of the bay.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent toward dusk, the promise of a clear night emerges. With temperatures gently dropping to a comfortable coolness, a light jacket would suit the evening strolls perfectly. It\u2019s a splendid moment to embrace the city\u2014the parks beckon, perhaps for a leisurely read or some cherished quiet time. Under the evening sky, one might find joy in a quiet caf\u00e9, savoring warm beverages while the city transitions to the softness of night. As the hour grows late, the stars will blink into view, inviting dreamers to ponder beneath the shimmering vastness above.",
