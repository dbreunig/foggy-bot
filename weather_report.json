Residents can expect a gradual transformation, with the sun breaking free shortly after the morning drizzle recedes, nudging temperatures towards a comfortable high.\n\nIn the transition that awaits, the city will don a predominantly sunny disposition, suggesting an invitation to step outdoors. As you consider your attire, think layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket that can be shed as warmth emerges while strolling along the waterfront or looping through the parks that cradle the heart of this vibrant city. With winds flowing softly from the southwest, a gentle breeze will keep the atmosphere refreshing against the sunlit backdrop.
