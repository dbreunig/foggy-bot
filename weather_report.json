The expected sun breaks through, bathing the city in golden hues as the temperature is poised to hover around a pleasant 66 degrees before gradually settling at a cooler 62 later in the afternoon. The southwestern winds whisper softly through the streets, carrying a refreshing touch that dances playfully with the city's vibrant energy. \n\nDespite the early remnants of the marine layer, today holds the promise of clarity, inviting locals to tread through the city's diverse landscapes. With such graceful weather, a light jacket or layered clothing would serve well, allowing for comfort in the coolness as the shadows lengthen and the air shifts to a more temperate embrace. Whether one opts to stroll through the quiet parks or explore the bustling farmers\u2019 markets that spring to life on sunlit corners, each moment presents itself as a subtle reminder of the day's beauty. As night approaches, the temperatures will dip discreetly to about 53 degrees, encouraging one to tuck in with a warm cup of tea, reflecting on the simplicity of a day well spent.",
