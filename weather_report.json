    "weather_report": "In Downtown San Francisco, the afternoon unfolds with a radiant sun hovering over the skyline, casting a warm glow that dances across the rooftops. The air is alive, a gentle breeze whispering down the streets, invigorating the senses with every cool gust. As temperatures sway just above sixty degrees, a delightful clarity stretches across the horizon, interspersed with soft clouds suggesting a playful interaction between sea and sky. Yet, a subtle hint of fog lingers in the distance, coaxed near the Golden Gate, where the marine layer gently brushes the hills, a reminder of the coastal chill that often paints this vibrant city.\n\nAs the sun makes its descent later, the evening promises to unveil a lightly clouded canvas, perfect for a tranquil stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a quiet sit at a favorite caf\u00e9, watching the world pass by. Given the mild temperatures and refreshing winds, layering is wise; a light sweater or jacket would serve well as the night draws near and the air cools to a soft embrace. Evening adventures could lead one to a cozy bookstore or a local art exhibit, where the unique spirit of San Francisco continues to wander and inspire.",
