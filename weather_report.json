    "weather_report": "As the city awakens from its nightly slumber, a gentle haze cloaks San Francisco, a reminder of the marine layer that loves to linger near the coast. The air feels crisp and cool, hovering around the mid-fifties, inviting a layer of comfort against the early coolness. For those stepping out, a light jacket would be a wise companion, as the west-southwest winds whisper through the streets at a calm seven miles per hour, adding just a hint of movement to the soft morning air.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the fog to lift, revealing a sunny embrace that beckons residents and visitors alike to enjoy the outdoors. Underneath a cloudless sky, temperatures will climb gracefully, offering a pleasant high near sixty-seven. A mild southwest breeze, picking up through the afternoon, will create a lively atmosphere, ideal for a stroll along the Embarcadero or perhaps a visit to SFMOMA, where both art and architecture inspire reflection. It is a day made for quiet coffee conversations or leisurely explorations of hidden gems in the Mission District, as the city's vibrant life pulses gently to the rhythm of summer.",
